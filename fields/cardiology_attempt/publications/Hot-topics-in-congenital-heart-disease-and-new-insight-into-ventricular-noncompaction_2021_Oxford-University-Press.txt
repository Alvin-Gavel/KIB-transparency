This Focus Issue on congenital heart disease contains the Special
Article 'Transition to adulthood and transfer to adult care of
adolescents with congenital heart disease: a global consensus statement'.1 Most children with congenital heart disease
(CHD) in high-income countries survive into adulthood. Further,
paediatric cardiac services have expanded in middle-income countries. Both evolutions have resulted in an increasing number of CHD
survivors.2-5 In adolescence, patients transition from being a dependent child to an independent adult. They are also advised to transfer
from paediatrics to adult care. There is no universal consensus
regarding how transitional care should be provided and how transfer
should be organized. This consensus document describes issues and
practices of transition and transfer of adolescents with CHD,
accounting for different possibilities in high-, middle-, and low-income
countries. Transitional care ought to be provided to all adolescents
with CHD, taking into consideration the available resources. When
reaching adulthood, patients ought to be transferred to adult care
facilities/providers capable of managing their needs, and systems must
be in place to make sure that continuity of high-quality care is ensured
after leaving paediatric cardiology.
In a State of the Art Review article entitled 'Management of
acute cardiovascular complications in pregnancy', Gabriele
Egidy Assenza from the IRCCS Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di
Bologna in Italy and colleagues note that the growing population of
women of reproductive age with heart disease has been associated
with an increasing number of high-risk pregnancies.6 Pregnant
women with heart disease are a very heterogeneous population, with
different risks for maternal cardiovascular, obstetric, and foetal complications.7-11 Adverse cardiovascular events during pregnancy pose
significant clinical challenges, with uncertainties regarding diagnostic
and therapeutic approaches potentially compromising maternal and

foetal health. This review provides a summary of recommendations
on the management of acute cardiovascular complications during
pregnancy, based on available literature and expert opinion. The
authors cover the diagnosis, risk stratification, and therapy, and the
review is organized according to the clinical presentation and the
type of complication, providing a reference for the practising cardiologist, obstetrician, and acute medicine specialist, while highlighting
areas of need and potential future research. Topics covered include
heart failure (HF), arrhythmias, coronary artery disease, aortic and
thrombo-embolic events, and the management of mechanical heart
valves during pregnancy (Figure 1) .
In a Clinical Research article entitled 'Lack of specialist care is
associated with increased morbidity and mortality in adult
congenital heart disease: a population-based study',
Gerhard-Paul Diller from the University Hospital Munster in
Germany, and colleagues aimed to provide population-based data on
the healthcare provision for adults with congenital heart disease
(ACHD) and the impact of cardiology care on morbidity and mortality in this vulnerable population.12 Based on administrative data from
one of the largest German Health Insurance Companies, all insured
ACHD patients (<70 years of age) were included. Patients were
stratified into those followed exclusively by primary care physicians
(PCPs) and those with additional cardiology follow-up between 2014
and 2016. Associations between level of care and outcome were
assessed by multivariable/propensity score Cox analyses. Overall, 24
139 patients (median age 43 years, 54.8% female) were included. Of
these, only 50% had cardiology follow-up during the 3-year period,
with 49% of patients only being cared for by PCPs and 1% having no
contact with either. After comprehensive multivariable and propensity score adjustment, ACHD patients under cardiology follow-up
had a significantly lower risk of death [hazard ratio (HR) 0.81;
P = 0.03] or major events (HR 0.85; P < 0.001) compared with those
only followed by PCPs. At 3-year follow-up, the absolute risk difference for mortality was 0.9% higher in ACHD patients with

moderate/severe complexity lesions under the care of PCPs compared with those under cardiology follow-up (Figure 2).
The authors conclude that cardiology care compared with primary
care is associated with superior survival and lower rates of major
complications in ACHD. It is alarming that even in a high-resource
setting with well-established specialist ACHD care, 50% of contemporary ACHD patients are still not linked to regular cardiac care.
Thus, more efforts are required to alert PCPs and patients to appropriate ACHD care. The manuscript is accompanied by an Editorial
by Anne Marie Valente from the Brigham and Women's Hospital in
Boston, MA, USA and Abigail Khan from the Oregon Health and
Science University in Portland, OR, USA.13 The authors conclude
that it is clear that cardiology care matters for adults living with CHD.
The next step for us all is to take this message forward, educating
providers, empowering patients, and developing better care networks to support this growing population of individuals with complex
care needs.

outcome in pregnancies of women with congenital heart disease
(CHD).14 Based on administrative data from one of the largest
German Health Insurance Companies (BARMER GEK, 9 million
members representative for Germany), all pregnancies in women
with CHD between 2005 and 2018 were analysed. In addition, an
age-matched non-CHD control group was included for comparison,
and the association between ACHD and maternal or neonatal outcomes was investigated. Overall, 7512 pregnancies occurred in 4015
women with CHD. The matched non-CHD control group included
6502 women with 11 225 pregnancies. Caesarean deliveries were
more common in CHD patients (40.5% vs. 31.5% in the control
group; P < 0.001). There was no excess mortality. Although the maternal complication rate was low in absolute terms, women with
CHD had a significantly higher rate of stroke, HF, and cardiac arrhythmias during pregnancy (P <0.001 for all). Neonatal mortality was low
but also significantly higher in the ACHD group (0.83% vs. 0.22%; P =
0.001), and neonates to CHD mothers had significantly low/extremely low birth weight or extreme immaturity, or required resuscitation
and mechanical ventilation more often compared with non-CHD offspring. On multivariate logistic regression, maternal defect complexity, arterial hypertension, HF, prior fertility treatment, and
anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists emerged as significant

predictors of adverse neonatal outcome. Recurrence of CHD was
6.1 times higher in infants to ACHD mothers compared with
controls.
The authors conclude that this population-based study illustrates a
reassuringly low maternal mortality rate in a highly developed healthcare system. Nevertheless, maternal morbidity and neonatal morbidity/mortality were significantly increased in women with ACHD,
highlighting the need for specialized care and pre-pregnancy counselling. This manuscript is accompanied by an Editorial by Jolien W.
Roos-Hesselink from Erasmus MC in Rotterdam, the Netherlands,
and colleagues.15 The authors note that the study by Lammers et al. is
an excellent and clinically relevant contribution to the existing literature on pregnancy in women with CHD. The study shows that a
good healthcare system, a multidisciplinary approach, and decisive
pre-pregnancy counselling are effective in achieving safe pregnancies.
Pre-pregnancy counselling with an individualized approach is a crucial
step in this process, because both maternal and perinatal outcomes
vary largely by the complexity of maternal illness, and further studies
dedicated to specific congenital diagnoses are still warranted.
Left ventricular non-compaction (LVNC) cardiomyopathy is a devastating genetic disease caused by insufficient consolidation of ventricular wall muscle that can result in inadequate cardiac
performance.16 Despite being the third most common cardiomyopathy, the mechanisms underlying the disease, including the cell types
involved, are poorly understood. In a Translational Research article
entitled 'Endocardial/endothelial angiocrines regulate cardiomyocyte development and maturation and induce features of ventricular non-compaction', Siyeon Rhee from
Stanford University in Stanford, CA, USA, and colleagues aimed to
identify candidate angiocrines expressed by endocardial and endothelial cells in embryonic hearts of Tie2Cre;Ino80fl/fl transgenic mouse
(an experimental model of LVNC). Then they tested the effect of
these candidates on cardiomyocyte proliferation and maturation.17
The authors observed a pathological endocardial cell population in
non-compacted hearts and identified multiple dysregulated angiocrine factors that dramatically affected cardiomyocyte behaviour.
They identified Col15a1 as a coronary vessel-secreted angiocrine factor, down-regulated by Ino80 deficiency, that functioned to promote
cardiomyocyte proliferation. Furthermore, mutant endocardial and
endothelial cells up-regulated expression of secreted factors, such as
Tgfbi, Igfbp3, Isg15, and Adm, which decreased cardiomyocyte
proliferation.
The authors conclude that these findings support a model where
coronary endothelial cells normally promote myocardial compaction
through secreted factors, but that endocardial and endothelial cells
can secrete factors that contribute to non-compaction under pathological conditions. The contribution is accompanied by an Editorial
by Stefanie Dimmeler and Julian Wagner from the Goethe University
in Frankfurt, Germany.18 The authors note that the study by Rhee et
al. elegantly identifies the importance of a timely orchestrated and
well-balanced repertoire of extracellular factors that coordinate the
proper development of the left ventricle. It will be important to learn
more about the cellular cross-talk to understand the mechanisms of
cardiac development and homeostasis. The interplay between endothelial cells and other vascular cells such as pericytes and smooth
muscle cells, and fibroblasts and immune cells, with cardiomyocytes
