See the editorial comment for this article 'Identification of a novel therapeutic target in vascular dysfunction: a showcase
of reverse and forward translational research linking bench to bedside', by Hiroshi Iwata and Tohru Minamino, https://

Aims

Assessment of endothelial function in humans by measuring flow-mediated dilation (FMD) risk-stratifies individuals
with established cardiovascular disease, whereas its predictive value is limited in primary prevention. We therefore
aimed to establish and evaluate novel markers of FMD at the population level.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
In order to identify novel targets that were negatively correlated with FMD and investigate their contribution to
and results
vascular function, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 4175 participants of the population
based Gutenberg Health Study. Subsequently, conditional knockout mouse models deleting the gene of interest
were generated and characterized. GWAS analysis revealed that single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the
tubulin-folding cofactor E (TBCE) gene were negatively correlated with endothelial function and TBCE expression.
Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC)-targeted TBCE deficiency was associated with endothelial dysfunction, aortic wall
hypertrophy, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated VSMC hyperproliferation in mice, paralleled by calnexin
up-regulation and exacerbated by the blood pressure hormone angiotensin II. Treating SMMHC-ERT2-Creth/TBCEfl/fl
mice with the ER stress modulator tauroursodeoxycholic acid amplified Raptor/Beclin-1-dependent autophagy and
reversed vascular dysfunction.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
TBCE and tubulin homeostasis seem to be novel predictors of vascular function and offer a new drug target to
ameliorate ER stress-dependent vascular dysfunction.

Introduction
Vascular dysfunction is a hallmark of cardiovascular disease (CVD).
The specific properties of endothelial, smooth muscle and immune
cells converge on the vasculature and determine vascular tone and
homeostasis. Endothelial and/or smooth muscle cell dysfunction as
well as activated immune cells contribute to progression of CVD,1,2
the leading cause of mortality worldwide.3
Disruption of endothelial homeostasis leads to disturbed nitric
oxide-dependent regulation of the vascular tone.4 Myeloid cells
are important contributors to the initiation of vascular dysfunction, inflammation, and remodelling,5 in part by their ability to secrete chemokines and cytokines.5 Vascular smooth muscle cells

Flow-mediated

(VSMCs) are mural cells continually exposed to biochemical and
mechanical stress generated in the circulation. They adapt to
hemodynamic stimuli by switching to a hypertrophic, proliferative
phenotype, and by secreting extracellular matrix proteins.6
Thereby, they participate in the regulation of vascular tone and
blood pressure.7
Numerous non-invasive techniques including flow-mediated dilation (FMD), venous occlusion plethysmography, or peripheral arterial
tone/pulse waveform analysis have been developed for assessment of
endothelial function.8 FMD as the most frequently used technique, is
useful for risk stratification in cohorts afflicted by CVD,9,10 whereas
data from various population-based studies have yielded equivocal
results on the prognostic value of FMD concerning future

Materials and methods
Full methods are available in the Supplementary material online.

Genome-wide association study
SNP information was gained from the genome data available from the
GHS as previously described,15 employing Affymetrix Genome-Wide
Human SNP 6.0 arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA); after quality
control, genetic data of 4,175 individuals were available for analysis.
Correlation analysis by linear regression was performed in order to identify SNPs that were associated with FMD.

Animals
Three different strains of cell-specific, conditional knockout mouse models of tubulin-folding cofactor E (TBCE) were generated by serial crossings. TBCEtm1c mice were first generated according to EUCOMMV
instructions.16,17 LysMCreth/TBCEfl/fl mice were generated for myeloid
cell-specific deficiency of TBCE,18 Tie2-ERT2Creth/TBCEfl/fl mice as a
conditional knockdown model in endothelial cells (ECs),19 and SMMHCERT2-Creth/TBCEfl/fl as a conditional knockdown model in smooth
muscle cells.20 For all the above-mentioned strains, age-matched
Creth/TBCEwt/wt littermates were used as controls in all experiments. A
total of 60 LysMCreth/TBCEfl/fl, 80 Tie2-ERT2-Creth/TBCEfl/fl, and 140
SMMHC-ERT2-Creth/TBCEfl/fl mice were used in the experiments. All
animals were inbred and received proper care in compliance with the
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the US
National Institutes of Health (NIH Publication No. 85-23, revised 1985) and
were approved by the Ethical Committee of the Prefecture of RheinlandPfalz (G17-1-031). All animal experiments were performed in line with the
ARRIVE guidelines.21 The breeding strategy, genotyping, and workflow are
described in Supplementary material online, Figure S2. Animals that did not
meet the wellbeing criteria regarding the 3Rs were excluded from the
experiments, while no outliers were removed from the experiments. The
TBCEtm2c (e.g. TBCEfl/fl) strain has been accepted for archiving in the
INFRAFRONTIER/EMMA repository (EMMA ID: EM13235) and is available
for research purposes (https://www.infrafrontier.eu/search).

Vascular relaxation and constriction studies
To assess vasodilator potential of isolated aortic segments (3 mm), they
were mounted to force transducers in organ chambers to test their
response to acetylcholine (ACh) and nitroglycerine (GTN). The aortic
rings were pre-constricted with prostaglandin F2a (PGF2a, 3 nM),
a VSMC-dependent constrictor22 to reach 50-80% of the tone induced
by KCl. Concentration-relaxation curves were recorded in response to
the endothelium-dependent vasodilator ACh (1 nM to 3 mM) as well as

GTN (1 nM to 30 mM).23 Aortic tissue was snap frozen for further molecular and histological analyses.

Statistical analysis
Data are presented as means +/- standard deviation. Continuous variables
were compared among groups using one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) and post hoc comparisons were made using Tukey's test, while
comparisons concerning the ACh and GTN relaxation and tension data
were analysed by two-way ANOVA and Tukey's test. No assumption of
equal variability of differences was performed and data were corrected
with Greenhouse-Geisser correction. A P-value of <0.05 was considered
statistically significant. All statistical analyses and graph preparation were
performed using GraphPad Prism 8.5 analysis software (GraphPad
Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). No outliers due to biological diversity
were excluded. Samples that did not meet our technical criteria were not
included into the analyses a priori. The absence of outlying values was confirmed by GraphPad Prism analysis software, using ROUT method and
Q = 1%. Complete statistical analysis is included in the Supplementary
material online.

Results
Single-nucleotide polymorphisms
rs6675944 and rs12405889 are negatively
correlated with TBCE expression and
flow-mediated arterial dilation
GHS revealed that SNPs rs6675944 (T!C) and rs1205889 (T!G) in
chromosome 1 were negatively correlated with FMD of the brachial
artery (rs6675944 b = 0.4841, P = 5.9e27, R2tot = 0.006 and b =
0.4841, P = 2.3e12, R2tot = 0.006; rs12405889 b = 0.5028,
P = 8.8e14, R2tot = 0.006 and b = 0.5028, P = 1.0e25, R2tot = 0.006)
(Table 1). Moreover, rs6675944 was associated with decreased reflection index pre occlusion and post occlusion and increased intimamedia thickness (IMT; mm), showing an increased arterial stiffness
phenotype in the SNP-bearing individuals24 (Table 1).
Both SNPs were found in the TBCE (tubulin folding cofactor E,
or tubulin-specific chaperone E) gene region. mRNA expression
analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from individuals that were enrolled in GHS revealed that SNPs were negatively associated with TBCE expression (b estimate: 0.4841,
R2tot = 0.010) (Figure 1A and B). GTEx Portal25 and NIH U.S.
National Library of Medicine26 data analysis showed that both
SNPs have been identified in various human population studies,
with a high occurrence in the general population (Supplementary
material online, Figure S1). In a pooled human tissue expression
analysis-as performed from TBCE gene expression data in various analysed tissues and attained from the GTEx Portal-both
homozygous and heterozygous genotypes were associated with
down-regulation of TBCE expression, being more pronounced in
the homozygous genotype (Figure 1E and F; GTEx Portal).
Concerning the individual tissue analysis, skeletal muscle TBCE
expression appeared to be mostly affected by the presence of
SNPs (logP = 12.6 and 15.2, respectively), while SNPs were
also found to negatively affect TBCE expression in aortic and tibial
arterial tissue (Figure 1C and D; GTEx Portal). Conclusively, our
GWAS as well as GTEx human data show that the presence of
TBCE SNPs is correlated with decreased transcripts of the gene in

cardiovascular events.9,11,12 The Gutenberg Health Study (GHS) is a
population-based prospective cohort study and has previously
shown that mid-regional pro-adrenomedullin and mid-regional proatrial natriuretic peptide were associated with FMD.13
In the GHS, FMD was strongly associated with age, sex, body mass
index, and biomarkers of arterial hypertension or heart failure,13 but
classical risk factors accounted for only 15.4% of the variability of the
reflective hyperaemic response in FMD.14 The scope of our current
study was to discover novel single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
that correlate with FMD through genome-wide association study
(GWAS) at the population level. Furthermore, we aimed to identify
putative mechanisms by the generation and vascular phenotyping of
cell-specific conditional knockout mouse models.

infusion with AngII. Vascular relaxation in response to ACh and GTN
were comparable between Tie2-ERT2-Creth/TBCEfl/fl mice and controls (Supplementary material online, Figure S7A-G). Although the vascular resistance and pulsatility indexes as measures of vascular stiffness
did not differ between groups (Supplementary material online, Figure
S7H-J), a significant increase in wall thickness was detected only in Tie2ERT2-Creth/TBCEfl/flthAngII mice, independently of changes in (relative) collagen content (Supplementary material online, Figure S7K-M).
CC-chemokine ligand 2 (Ccl2), interleukin-6 (Il6), and tumour necrosis factor alpha (Tnfa) mRNA expression was significantly up-regulated in Tie2-ERT2-Creth/TBCEfl/fl mice compared to controls and
in part amplified by AngII (Supplementary material online, Figure S8A).
Staining of CD45/CD31th pulmonary ECs isolated from the Tie2ERT2-Creth/TBCEfl/fl animals revealed an up-regulation of NACHT,
LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3 (NLRP3, Supplementary
material online, Figure S8B). NLRP3 inflammasome activation in Tie2ERT2-Creth/TBCEfl/fl was confirmed by immunoblotting for
NACHT, LRR, FIIND, CARD domain, and PYD domains-containing
protein 1 (NALP1), NLRP3 and their downstream target cleaved caspase 1 which was increased by AngII (Supplementary material online,
Figure S8C). Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers calnexin,
CHOP and protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase
(PERK) as well as cleaved caspase-1 were increased in aortas and in
ECs isolated from Tie2-ERT2-Creth/TBCEfl/fl mice, in part augmented by AngII (Supplementary material online, Figure S8D and E).
The slightly increased susceptibility of Tie2-ERT2-Creth/TBCEfl/fl to
AngII-induced hypertension (Supplementary material online, Figure
S9) may be related to this pro-inflammatory vascular phenotype of
Tie2-ERT2Creth/TBCEfl/fl mice, without a significant accumulation of
inflammatory cells at baseline (Supplementary material online, Figure

TBCE deficiency promotes vascular dysfunction by increased ER stress

VSMC-specific deficiency of TBCE
modulates vascular inflammatory gene
expression, promotes augmentation of
endoplasmic reticulum stress and causes
a proliferative phenotype paralleled by
calnexin up-regulation
Expression analysis of the aortas confirmed down-regulation of the
Tbce mRNA in SMMHC-ERT2-Creth/TBCEfl/fl mice. AngII led to an
up-regulation of vascular inflammation markers, such as Ccl2, Il6, Il1b,
Tnfa and Vcam1 in controls and was significantly attenuated in the
SMMHC-ERT2-Creth/TBCEfl/fl mice (Figure 3A). This phenotype was
not accompanied by a significant immune cell infiltration in the
SMMHC-ERT2-Creth/TBCEfl/fl aortas (Supplementary material online, Figure S14). Interestingly, AngII treatment of the floxed mice led to
a 28-fold increase of Lcn2, encoding for lipocalin-2 or neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, a growth factor and iron sequester involved
in innate immune responses.27 Immunofluorescence staining showed
an increased abundance of calnexin in the aortic vasculature of
SMMHC-ERT2-Creth/TBCEfl/fl mice, indicating increased ER stress
(Figure 3B). This was confirmed in VSMCs isolated from the murine
aortas, showing a significant increase in calnexin, protein-disulfide
isomerase (PDI) and CHOP in response to AngII (100 nM in vitro) and
more pronounced in the SMMHC-ERT2-Creth/TBCEfl/fl group,
showing signs of ER stress already at baseline. Inositol-requiring enzyme 1a (IRE-1a) is an intracellular sensor protein of misfolded protein response and was decreased in both AngII-treated and shamtreated VSMCs from SMMHC-ERT2-Creth/TBCEfl/fl mice, compatible
with ER stress (Figure 3C). In aortic lysates, immunoblotting revealed

an AngII-mediated increase in calnexin, CHOP and PDI expression,
which was more pronounced in SMMHC-ERT2-Creth/TBCEfl/fl mice
(Figure 3D).
To further pinpoint putative mechanisms of TBCE-related vascular
dysfunction, primary VSMCs were isolated from aortas and analysed
by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. Decreased TBCE expression along with double-nucleated cells positive for a-tubulin
staining indicating a proliferative phenotype were observed in
SMMHC-ERT2-Creth/TBCEfl/fl mice (Figure 4A, C and D).
Furthermore, immunofluorescence staining revealed up-regulated
calnexin in VSMCs from SMMHC-ERT2-Creth/TBCEfl/fl mice, independently of AngII treatment (Figure 4B and E) and in line with augmented ER stress. We found significantly higher proliferation of
VSMCs from SMMHC-ERT2-Creth/TBCEfl/fl mice compared to controls at baseline which was increased by AngII (100 nM) in VSMCs
from both groups (Figure 4F). Using RNA silencing, we confirmed in
human aortic smooth muscle cells (HAoSMCs), that decreased
TBCE expression is associated with increased a-tubulin expression
(Figure 4G-J). AngII treatment caused an increase in calnexin expression in control-transfected HAoSMCs, while the TBCE-silenced
HAoSMCs had an increased calnexin expression at baseline, which
was further up-regulated by AngII (Figure 4H and K). AngII increased
proliferation of HAoSMCs in both the control and TBCE-siRNA
group, while siRNA-transfected VSMCs exhibited a proliferative
phenotype even in the absence of AngII (Figure 4L). Taken together,
these data support a calnexin-associated increase in ER stress in
VSMC-specific TBCE deficiency, which is linked to vascular inflammation and proliferation.

TUDCA reverses vascular dysfunction in
mice with VSMC-specific deficiency of
TBCE and decreases VSMC proliferation
by amplification of Raptor/Beclin-1mediated autophagy
To test whether the phenotype of TBCE-deficient mice could be
modulated pharmacologically, we administered the chemical chaperone and ER stress modulator tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA,
300 mg/kg/day) to SMMHC-ERT2Creth/TBCEfl/fl mice. TUDCA
reversed vascular dysfunction, as presented by restored ACh-mediated relaxation (Figure 5A and B). TUDCA administration decreased
PGF2a induced maximal constriction both in SMMHC-ERT2-Creth/

TBCEfl/fl and SMMHC-ERT2-Creth/TBCEwt/wt mice (Figure 5C).
Western blot analysis revealed that TUDCA decreased the ER stress
markers Bip and CHOP in the SMMHC-ERT2-Creth/TBCEfl/fl mice,
while it led to an enhancement of the Raptor/Beclin-1 pathway
(which plays an important role in autophagy28) independently of

5D and E). In vitro, TUDCA treatment reversed the hyper-proliferative phenotype of SMMHC-ERT2-Creth/TBCEfl/fl VSMCs, decreasing their proliferation and cellular confluency (Figure 5F and G).
Protein expression analysis revealed that TUDCA decreased CHOP
expression and caused an up-regulation of Raptor/Beclin-1, independently of LC3B in vitro (Figure 5H and I). Therefore, TBCE deficiency in VSMCs drives vascular dysfunction, which can be
attenuated by TUDCA-induced ER stress modulation and amplification of Raptor/Beclin-1-mediated autophagy.

Compared to controls, SMMHC-ERT2-Creth/TBCEfl/fl aortas
showed reduced response to PGF2a induced constriction with an
even lesser response in SMMHC-ERT2-Creth/TBCEfl/flthAngII group
(Figure 2A). SMMHC-ERT2-Creth/TBCEfl/fl mice were characterized
by increased aortic stiffness, further exacerbated by AngII in vivo (Figure
2B and C). SMMHC-ERT2-Creth/TBCEfl/fl aortas had endothelial dysfunction at baseline compared to their controls (Figure 2D-G). Vascular
dysfunction was accompanied by increased left common carotid artery
(LCCA) resistance and pulsatility indexes (Figure 2H-J). Histological
evaluation of the aortas showed that wall thickness was increased in
SMMHC-ERT2-Creth/TBCEfl/fl mice, independent of AngII treatment.
AngII infusion induced collagen deposition both in SMMHC-ERT2Creth/TBCEwt/wt and SMMHC-ERT2-Creth/TBCEfl/fl mice, but more
prominently in the SMMHC-ERT2-Creth/TBCEfl/fl th AngII group
(Figure 2K-M). Taken together, VSMC-targeted TBCE ablation leads to
vascular dysfunction and stiffness, which is exacerbated by AngII.
AngII infusion led to a significant increase in LCCA wall thickness in
the SMMHC-ERT2-Creth/TBCEfl/fl mice reflective of increased vascular stiffness. It increased transverse aortic diameter in both
SMMHC-ERT2-Creth/TBCEwt/wt
and
SMMHC-ERT2-Creth/
fl/fl

TBCE mice by trend (Supplementary material online, Figure S12).
Moreover, AngII led to a significant increase in systolic and diastolic
blood pressure in both SMMHC-ERT2-Creth/TBCEwt/wt and
SMMHC-ERT2-Creth/TBCEfl/fl mice, while only the SMMHC-ERT2Creth/TBCEfl/flthAngII animals had a significant increase in heart rate,
left ventricular ejection fraction and left ventricular posterior wall
thickness (Supplementary material online, Figure S13).

Discussion

total of 61 transcripts, indicating that rs6675944 has a 70% probability
of leading to a non-functional or truncated protein. rs12405889 can
result in 39 transcripts that undergo nonsense-mediated decay and 8
non-coding transcript exon variants out of the total of 61 transcripts,
indicating that rs12405889 has a 77% probability of leading to a nonfunctional or truncated protein.
TBCE specifically modulates a-tubulin incorporation in microtubule networks, which are responsible for cellular integrity, protein
transportation and signal transduction.38 Deletion and truncation of
TBCE in humans are known to lead to the Sanjad-Sakati or KennyCaffey syndrome, which is characterized by congenital hypoparathyroidism, mental retardation, facial dysmorphism and extreme growth
deficits,39 while it is also associated with the prevalence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.40 So far, research on TBCE has focused on
the central nervous system,41 where it has been shown that downregulation of TBCE leads to Golgi microtubule deficits, which in turn
leads to accumulation of ER-Golgi SNAREs.40,42 In addition, it was
shown in yeast that TBCE can secure the connection between microtubules and proteasome, protecting cells against misfolded protein
stress in a cAMP-independent regulatory protein (PAC2)-dependent
manner.43
Conclusively, in silico data show that both rs6675944 and
rs12405889 SNPs-despite the fact that they are intronic SNPs-are
characterized by an epigenetic regulatory trait, while having high
probability to result in the generation of a truncated or dysfunctional
protein. These findings prompted us to investigate TBCE-associated
vascular effects in a translational approach in vivo.
With the present studies, we identified that endothelial-specific
knockdown of TBCE leads to increased vessel wall thickness.
Mechanistically, endothelial-specific TBCE knockdown was found to
be associated with an inflammatory phenotype of the aortas and induction of ER stress. ER stress, a physiological response to unfolded
protein accumulation, was associated with NLRP3 activation in the
endothelium44 and could act as a mediator of CVDs and hypertension.45 In our model, activation of ER stress may be responsible for
activation of NLRP3 inflammasome, which leads to production and
release of cytokines, such as interleukin-6. The aforementioned inflammatory stimuli may therefore orchestrate the crosstalk between
ECs and VSMCs46 and induce VSMC proliferation and hypertrophy causing the thickened vessel wall47 as seen in the Tie2-ERT2Creth/TBCEfl/fl
transgenic mice.
The VSMC-targeted transgenic mice showed vascular dysfunction
and stiffness already at baseline, which was aggravated by AngII treatment. Lipocalin-2 (LCN2) was up-regulated in the SMMHC-ERT2Creth/TBCEfl/fl aortas, especially after AngII treatment (Figure 3A).

In the current study, we present novel evidence that SNPs in the
TBCE gene and TBCE down-regulation are important determinants
of vascular dysfunction both in humans and mice. While endothelialtargeted TBCE deficiency induces a moderate inflammatory phenotype in the aorta, VSMCs-targeted TBCE deficiency leads to exacerbated vascular stiffness and inflammation, smooth muscle cell
proliferation, and endothelial dysfunction associated with ER stress.
GWAS analyses have provided an invaluable tool to identify novel
targets and mediators of CVD, including acute and chronic coronary
syndrome.29 Among those studies, novel non-coding SNPs,30 as well
as genetic mutations31 have been associated with vascular dysfunction and hypertension in the general population.32 GWAS on the
FMD axis are scarce, however, some state-of-the-art GWAS analyses
have identified an association of cardiac and vascular functional
parameters with distinct genomic profiles.33 It is noteworthy that
throughout these genomic associations molecular targets that are already known to effect vascular homeostasis, such as endothelial nitric
oxide synthetase or vascular endothelial growth factor have emerged
as leading targets of interest.29 The GWAS analysis derived from the
GHS presented here is the first that reveals an association of the
SNPs rs6675944 and rs12405889 in the TBCE gene with vascular
function. rs6675944 polymorphism was additionally associated with
increased carotid wall thickness showing an increased susceptibility
of the SNP-bearing individuals to arterial stiffness.24
Both rs6675944 and rs12405889 SNPs are found in intron
domains of the TBCE gene and lead to the generation of TBCE intron
variants. Mutations at a specific site at which intron splicing occurs
can cause genetic insertion, deletion or frame shift. Mutations in these
sequences may lead to retention of large segments of intronic DNA
during mRNA maturation, or to entire exon removal. These changes
can result in the generation of a non-functional protein and result in
the manifestation of diseases.34 Alternative Splice Site Predictor
(ASSP) software35 revealed that the rs6675944 site is a highly probable alternative isoform/cryptic 50 splice site (activation score: 0.879;
confidence: 0.908) while rs12405889 is a highly probable alternative
isoform/cryptic 30 splice site (activation score: 0.674; confidence:
0.533). Therefore, SNPs are highly probable to mediate alternative
or cryptic splicing of the TBCE gene. Cryptic splice sites are usually
not spliced during transcription leading to the accumulation of intronic DNA and therefore might lead to the generation of a non-functional protein.36 Finally, the Ensembl genome database37 revealed that
rs6675944 SNP can result in 37 transcripts that undergo nonsensemediated decay and 6 non-coding transcript exon variants out of the

Limitations of the study
Despite the fact that our study extensively investigated the role of
TBCE in vascular function in a translational manner, there are some
study limitations. It should be noted that the data presented here
may be limited by small sample sizes; a non-significant difference cannot be interpreted as a lack of association. Blood pressure in vivo was
assessed by a non-invasive methodology, namely tail-cuff measurements and not by the invasive telemetry catheter implantation
regarded as gold standard of blood pressure monitoring. Moreover,
ER stress is a general term, describing more complex pathophysiological processes than we assessed in this work. More functional
experiments will be needed to define the role of TBCE in ER stress in
more detail.65 Even though TUDCA has a well-established effect on
ER stress, it has a multifaceted mechanism and we cannot rule out
that its protective effects against vascular dysfunction are mediated-
at least in part-by other modes of action that are not related to
TBCE deficiency. To strengthen the findings from our GWAS study,
it should be considered to validate our associations in an independent
cohort in order to increase the translational value of TBCE SNPs as
mediators of vascular dysfunction.

LCN2 is associated with increased VSMC proliferation and migration48 or pro-fibrotic effects49 and is correlated with symptomatic carotid atherosclerosis in humans.50 LCN2 is a key inducer of ER stress
in human pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells and augments the
progression of pulmonary hypertension.51
By investigating aortas and VSMCs isolated from the transgenic
mice, we found that vascular stiffness and dysregulation were related
to ER stress. Both in vivo and in vitro, ER chaperones and indicators of
ER stress such as calnexin and PDI52 were up-regulated when TBCE
was diminished in VSMCs, leading to increased VSMC proliferation.
To confirm that ER stress is involved in mediating the vascular
phenotype of SMMHC-ERT2-Creth/TBCEfl/fl mice, we used the
chemical chaperone TUDCA, shown to mitigate ER stress in multiple
cell types53 including VSMCs.54-56 Oral administration of TUDCA
reversed vascular dysfunction at the selected dose of 300 mg/kg.
Furthermore, it decreased PGF2a-induced contractility, paralleled by
the induction of Raptor/Beclin-1 related autophagy.57 Evidence on
TUDCA-induced autophagy are manifold; it may both inhibit and induce ER stress-mediated autophagy in nerve cells.58 However, it is
also established that TUDCA is capable of modulating the autophagy
machinery and induce/amplify autophagy signalling in familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy.59 It may also lead to Beclin-1-dependent autophagic flux,58 supporting our in vivo and in vitro data.
The role of TUDCA in the treatment of vascular dysfunction is
currently addressed by ongoing clinical studies [NCT03331432:
Effects of Dietary Supplement Tauroursodeoxycholic Acid on
Vascular Function (completed); NCT04001647: Targeting ER
Stress in Vascular Dysfunction (recruiting); data from https://
ClinicalTrials.gov]. TUDCA has shown to be beneficial in patients
with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in terms of cumulative survival
and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale
Revised score60 and in obese-diabetic patients in terms of insulin
reactivity,61 apparently with little side effects. It therefore seems
to be a safe dietary supplement and may be a promising agent
against arterial hypertension. This is supported by the notion that
in translational murine models, TUDCA has anti-hypertensive
effects. In ob/ob mice, TUDCA mitigated arterial hypertension
and cardiac hypertrophy.62 In spontaneously hypertensive rats
and in type 2 diabetic mice, TUDCA exhibited anti-hypertensive
potential and improved coronary arterial function, at least in part
by ameliorating ER stress.63,64
Conclusively, TBCE down-regulation leads to a multi-faceted vascular dysfunction in mice and humans. Most significantly, down-regulation of the chaperone TBCE in VSMCs leads to severe vascular
dysfunction and stiffness characterized by an aberrant ER response
and VSMC hyperplasia. Modulation of ER stress by the chemical
chaperone TUDCA, attenuated the phenotype through enhancement of Beclin-1-induced autophagy. The effectiveness of TUDCA
(approved in the USA for the treatment of primary biliary cirrhosis53)
suggests putative translational value of our findings.
This is the first study investigating the role of TBCE from bedside
to bench, highlighting the role of microtubule dynamics and ER stress
in the vascular homeostasis (see Graphical Abstract). It represents a
translational approach to identify novel targets of vascular dysfunction through a GWAS analysis of the general population, leading to
the discovery of up-to-now unknown contributors to vascular
dysfunction.

Translational perspective
With this translational research project, we report the hitherto unknown relation between tubulin-folding cofactor E (TBCE) and vascular function discovered in a genome-wide association study of 4175 individuals and further investigated the putative mechanisms in
three cell-specific conditional knockout animals. This is the first bedside-to-bench study correlating TBCE with vascular dysfunction,
establishing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress as a key-mediator of the phenotype. Importantly, administration of the clinically relevant
ER stress modulator tauroursodeoxycholic acid reversed vascular dysfunction in vivo. Our work establishes the grounds for further evaluating the role of TBCE and tubulin homeostasis in vascular dysfunction in both the pre-clinical and clinical setting.
