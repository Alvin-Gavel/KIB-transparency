Background

A systemic inflammatory response is observed in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Elevated serum levels of
C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of systemic inflammation, are associated with severe disease in bacterial or viral
infections. We aimed to explore associations between CRP concentration at initial hospital presentation and clinical
outcomes in patients with COVID-19.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
Consecutive adults aged >_18 years with COVID-19 admitted to a large New York healthcare system between 1
March and 8 April 2020 were identified. Patients with measurement of CRP were included. Venous thromboand results

embolism (VTE), acute kidney injury (AKI), critical illness, and in-hospital mortality were determined for all patients.
Among 2782 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, 2601 (93.5%) had a CRP measurement [median 108 mg/L,
interquartile range (IQR) 53-169]. CRP concentrations above the median value were associated with VTE [8.3%
vs. 3.4%; adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.61-3.36], AKI (43.0% vs. 28.4%; aOR 2.11,
95% CI 1.76-2.52), critical illness (47.6% vs. 25.9%; aOR 2.83, 95% CI 2.37-3.37), and mortality (32.2% vs. 17.8%;
aOR 2.59, 95% CI 2.11-3.18), compared with CRP below the median. A dose response was observed between
CRP concentration and adverse outcomes. While the associations between CRP and adverse outcomes were consistent among patients with low and high D-dimer levels, patients with high D-dimer and high CRP have the greatest risk of adverse outcomes.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusions
Systemic inflammation, as measured by CRP, is strongly associated with VTE, AKI, critical illness, and mortality in
COVID-19. CRP-based approaches to risk stratification and treatment should be tested.

Graphical Abstract

Introduction
The systemic inflammatory response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is a hallmark
of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and most hospitalized patients with COVID-19 have abnormal inflammatory biomarkers.1 C-reactive protein (CRP), an acute-phase protein first
described by Tillet and Francis,2 is synthesized by the liver in response to interleukin-6 (IL-6) and is a widely available biomarker of
inflammation.3 Elevated CRP concentrations are associated with
cardiovascular disease and acute kidney injury (AKI) in surgical
patients,4 with inflammatory rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and gout, and with incident venous thromboembolism (VTE) in community cohorts.5 C-reactive protein has
also been associated with severe disease in patients with H1N1 influenza pneumonia,6 and a number of recent series have reported
an association between higher CRP concentrations and greater disease severity in COVID-19.1,7-12 However, most studies were
small, and evaluated neither a dose response nor heterogeneity
across demographics. Moreover, the association between initial
CRP concentration and VTE and AKI in COVID-19 is uncertain.
The relationship between CRP concentrations and D-dimer, a fibrin degradation product that is associated with thrombosis in
COVID-19, has not been explored.13 The aim of this study is to explore the associations between CRP concentrations at initial hospital presentation and clinical outcomes, including VTE and AKI, in
patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized at a large healthcare system in New York.

..
.. Study participants and data collection
.. The study was approved by the New York University (NYU) Grossman
..
.. School of Medicine Institutional Review Board and performed with a wai.. ver of informed consent. We identified consecutive adults age >_18 years
.. with a nucleic acid amplification test positive for SARS-CoV-2 between 1
..
.. March 2020 and 8 April 2020 who were admitted to NYU Langone
.. Health (NYULH), a multi-hospital health system in New York. At all in..
.. patient facilities, CRP surveillance was standard of care for individuals
.. with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 diagnoses because it was
..
.. included in the electronic admission order sets during the pandemic. Due
.. to the high prevalence of inflammation in COVID-19, elevated CRP con.. centration (Siemens Dimension C-Reactive Protein, Siemens,
..
.. Washington DC; Abbot Architect C-Reactive Protein, Chicago, IL) was
.. defined as a measurement above the median value among patients hospi..
.. talized with COVID-19 at NYU. Patients were also divided into sub.. groups by quartile of initial CRP concentration. Demographics,
..
.. comorbidities, outpatient medications, clinical presentations, and other
.. laboratory data recorded for clinical purposes were abstracted from the
.. electronic health record. Only the initial in-hospital measurements for
..
.. each laboratory test were recorded. Relevant comorbidities, including

radiology reports and clinical documentation using a natural-language
processing tool (simpleNLP) with sensitivity and specificity >95%,
ICD-10 diagnosis codes assigned during hospitalization, and chart review of echocardiogram reports, as described previously.13 All thrombotic events were confirmed by manual medical record review. Acute
kidney injury was defined as an increase in serum creatinine by >_0.3
mg/dL within a 48 h period or a 50% increase in serum creatinine
compared with the baseline value. Critical illness was defined by treatment in an intensive care unit, need for mechanical ventilation, transfer
to a hospice, or in-hospital death. All-cause in-hospital mortality was
determined for all patients. Follow-up was complete through 13 May
2020.

Statistical analysis
Categorical variables are reported as frequencies and percentages, and
were compared by v2 tests. Continuous variables are presented as
mean (SD) and median [interquartile range (IQR)] and compared using
t-tests or non-parametric Mann-Whitney test for all non-normally distributed data. Patients were categorized by the median CRP concentration, or the quartile of CRP concentration. Logistic regression
models were generated to estimate the odds of the clinical endpoints,
adjusted for demographics and clinical comorbidities. Covariates
included in the multivariable models included age, sex, race/ethnicity,
body mass index, tobacco use, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, chronic
kidney disease, coronary artery disease, heart failure, malignancy, and
baseline laboratory values. Subgroup analyses were performed to
evaluate the consistency of the study findings by age, sex, race, and the
presence or absence of obesity [body mass index (BMI) >_30 kg/m2].
To evaluate trends in CRP over time, CRP trajectory plots were generated and stratified by clinical outcomes. Differences in CRP values by
group were compared by repeated measures analysis of variance
(ANOVA). Since D-dimer is associated with thrombosis in patients
with COVID-19, subgroup analyses were also performed to evaluate
relationships between CRP and outcomes by D-dimer level (above vs.
below the median value of 384 ng/mL).13 Finally, we investigated the
relationship between IL-6 and outcomes in patients with both CRP and
IL-6 measured at hospital presentation. Statistical analyses were performed using R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna,
Austria). Statistical tests are two-sided, and P-values <0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.

.. Results
..
..
.. Patient characteristics
..
.. A total of 2782 consecutive adults with COVID-19 were admitted to
.. NYULH between 1 March and 8 April 2020, and 2601 (93.5%) had a
..
.. measurement of CRP. The median initial CRP concentration was 108
.. mg/L (IQR 53-169) (Figure 1). Only 58 patients (2.2%) had an initial
..
.. normal CRP <5 mg/L (the upper reference limit for the assay).
.. Clinical characteristics of patients stratified by quartile of initial CRP
..
.. concentration are shown in Table 1. Patients with CRP concentra.. tions in the highest quartiles were more likely to be men (71.3% in
..
.. the highest CRP quartile vs. 52.6% in the lowest CRP quartile, P <
..
.. 0.001) and of Hispanic ethnicity (30.4% in the highest quartile vs.
.. 20.5% in the lowest quartile, P < 0.001) than patients with lower CRP
..
.. concentrations. Fewer patients with the highest CRP values had a his.. tory of heart failure (9.6% in the highest quartile vs. 16.4% in the low..
.. est quartile, P = 0.0004), coronary artery disease (18.5% vs. 27.5%, P
.. = 0.0002), or chronic kidney disease (16.8% vs. 23.9%, P = 0.0019).
..
.. Patients with the highest CRP concentrations were also less likely to
.. have been prescribed statin therapy (11.6% in the highest quartile vs.
..
.. 17.4% in the lowest quartile, P = 0.0035) or a beta-blocker (10% vs.
..
.. 15.3%, P = 0.005) prior to hospital admission. Elevated CRP concen.. trations at presentation were associated with higher temperatures
..
.. and lower oxygen saturation at presentation, as well as higher initial
.. white blood cell and platelet counts, higher initial D-dimer levels, and
..
.. higher initial ferritin concentrations (Figure 1). Clinical characteristics
.. of patients stratified by median initial CRP concentration are shown
..
.. in Supplementary material online Table S1. In a sensitivity analysis of
.. patients who were admitted and discharged alive with a hospital

Patients with the highest quartiles of CRP measured had the greatest
likelihood of VTE, AKI, critical illness, and mortality (Figure 2).
Associations between CRP concentration and adverse outcomes

Levels of D-dimer increased concordantly with higher quartiles of

in patients with low and high D-dimer (data not shown). In a subgroup analyses by D-dimer level, patients with low values of both
CRP and D-dimer were at low risk for in-hospital adverse events. In

0.001), and mortality (39.8% vs. 13.0%, P < 0.001) were substantially
higher in patients with concomitant elevations in CRP and D-dimer
compared with those with low CRP and D-dimer values (Figure 4A).
While both CRP and D-dimer increased the adjusted odds of an adverse outcome, patients with elevation of both CRP and D-dimer
concentrations had the greatest risk of adverse events (Figure 4B).
Among 2601 adults with COVID-19 and CRP concentration measured at presentation, 2224 (85.5%) had serial CRP measurements,
with a median of 5 (IQR 3-10) CRP measurements reported during
hospital admission. The median peak CRP concentration was 164
mg/L (91.09-251.5), measured on median hospital day 2 (IQR 0-5).
Higher peak CRP concentrations were reported among patients with
fatal COVID-19 (248.1 mg/L, IQR 169.0-395.0 vs. 141.0 mg/L, IQR
74.7-216.8 in patients who survived, P < 0.001). Levels of CRP were
significantly higher over time in patients who developed AKI, critical
illness, or who died during hospitalization. Levels of CRP over time
are shown in patients with and without fatal disease, critical illness,
VTE, and AKI (Figure 5A-D).
Since IL-6 is upstream of CRP in the inflammatory cascade, we
investigated the relationship between IL-6 and outcomes in 1693
patients with COVID-19 who had CRP and IL-6 measured at hospital
presentation. Elevated initial IL-6 and CRP concentrations in COVID19 were each associated with increased odds of mortality [IL-6 above

CRP above the median, aOR 1.93, 95% CI 1.50-2.49] and critical illness (IL-6, aOR 3.05, 95% CI 2.43-3.84; CRP, aOR 1.98, 95% CI
1.57-2.49) after adjustment for clinical covariates. When stratified by
initial CRP concentration, an initial IL-6 above the median value (>13
pg/mL) was associated with critical illness and mortality among
patients with CRP above (aOR for critical illness, 3.04, 95% CI 2.27-
4.06; aOR for mortality, 1.91, 95% CI 1.39-2.62) and below (aOR for
critical illness, 3.16, 95% CI 2.15-4.64; aOR for mortality, 2.51, 95%
CI 1.58-4.00) the median concentration. These data suggest that IL-6
may provide additional prognostic information in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.

Discussion
In an analysis of COVID-19 patients hospitalized in a large New York
health system, nearly all patients had evidence of a systemic inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection with a median CRP concentration of 108 mg/L, a value nearly 40-fold higher than the laboratory
upper limit of normal. Patients with elevated CRP concentrations
above the median value at the time of initial presentation were more
likely to have VTE, AKI, critical illness, and in-hospital mortality during

the subsequent hospital stay than those with lower initial measurements, and patients with the highest CRP values had the worst clinical
outcomes.
C-reactive protein is well established as a marker of systemic inflammation and severe infection. As an acute-phase reactant, CRP
binds to phosphocholine in pathogens and membranes of host cells,
and acts as an opsonin to enhance phagocytosis and facilitate clearance. Ligand-bound CRP also efficiently activates the classical pathway of the complement system, an important component of innate
host defence.14 Prior to the COVID-19 global pandemic, up to 90%
of all marked elevations in CRP concentration were attributed to an
infectious aetiology, most often from bacterial pathogens.15,16
Elevated CRP concentrations have also been reported in severe viral
infections, including H1N1 influenza pneumonia, and now in SARSCoV-2 infection.6-9 In a prior study of 298 patients with COVID-19,
patients who died had an initial CRP that was 10-fold higher than that
of survivors (100.0 vs. 9.7 mg/L, P < 0.001), and CRP concentrations
were associated with mortality, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.896.9 Recent reports also identified associations between CRP concentrations and respiratory
failure requiring mechanical ventilation, with a nearly five-fold greater
risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) reported in
patients with high-sensitivity CRP >5 mg/L compared with those with
lower CRP values.12,17 CRP is associated with extra-pulmonary disease in COVID-19, and correlations between CRP concentrations
and myocardial injury have been reported in multiple series.18-21 In
contrast, prior studies have not reported on the relationship between CRP and AKI and VTE in COVID-19, nor on serial measures
of CRP over time.
Other inflammatory markers are also associated with adverse outcomes in COVID-19. In our cohort, IL-6 was independently

associated with adverse outcomes in patients with high and low initial
CRP concentrations. In a separate analysis of 1400 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-a cytokine levels at the time of hospitalization were associated with survival
after adjustment for clinical comorbidities and CRP, D-dimer, and ferritin concentrations.22 These data confirm the observed relationships
between markers of inflammation and adverse clinical outcomes in
COVID-19. Ultimately, CRP may be preferred as a biomarker since it
is inexpensive and widely available at most medical centres, facilitating
rapid implementation of routine biomarker measurement into clinical
care of patients with COVID-19.
In contrast to CRP measurement for cardiovascular risk stratification, in which inflammation may contribute to accelerated atherosclerosis and instability of atherosclerotic plaque, CRP
concentrations in COVID-19 infection reflect disease severity and
the magnitude of the acute inflammatory response. The role of systemic inflammation in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 remains incompletely understood, and causal relationships between inflammation
measured by CRP and adverse clinical outcomes are speculative.
However, the detrimental inflammatory response observed in some
individuals with COVID-19 parallels secondary haemophagocytic
lymphohistiocytosis (also known as macrophage activation syndrome), and may independently contribute to multiorgan damage in
COVID-19.23,24 Earlier studies of patients with ARDS prior to
COVID-19 demonstrated that glucocorticoid administration reduces
CRP concentrations.25 In a recent randomized trial of dexamethasone immunosuppression in patients with severe COVID-19, steroid
therapy reduced the incidence of death among those who required
supplemental oxygen and in critically ill patients requiring invasive
mechanical ventilation. The clinical benefit of immunosuppression
further supports the hypothesis that inflammation in response to viral

Conclusions
Systemic inflammation, as measured by CRP, is strongly associated
with VTE, AKI, critical illness, and in-hospital mortality in patients
with COVID-19. Inflammatory biomarker-based approaches to risk
stratification and treatment should be evaluated to improve outcomes of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

infection contributes to poor outcomes in COVID-19.26 Thromboinflammation has been proposed as a mediator of adverse events in
COVID-19, with dysregulation of the normal antithrombotic function
of the endothelium in the response to inflammatory stress, leading to
leucocyte recruitment, complement and platelet activation, and
enhanced coagulation in the microvasculature.27,28 This is supported
by autopsy studies of decedents with COVID-19, in which platelets
with fibrin microthrombi were identified within the pulmonary, renal,
hepatic, and cardiac microcirculation.29 Thrombotic events, particularly pulmonary embolism, are common in COVID-19 and are associated with systemic inflammation.13,30 In the present analysis, CRP and
D-dimer were each independently associated with adverse events.
However, patients were at highest risk when they presented with
concomitant elevations in CRP and D-dimer concentrations, providing additional support for the synergistic role of inflammation and
thrombosis in the pathogenesis of disease associated with SARSCoV-2 infection. Given the role of micro- and macrothrombosis
in disease pathogenesis, an NIH-funded multicentre, adaptive,
randomized clinical trial [Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic
Interventions and Vaccines (ACTIV)-4] is ongoing to determine optimal antithrombotic dosing for patients hospitalized with COVID-19
(NCT04505774).
Limitations of this study include its retrospective observational
study design. The first measured CRP concentration at hospital admission was used for the primary analyses. Patients were hospitalized at a single healthcare system in New York during a 6-week
period of rapid viral spread, although a diverse cohort of COVID19 patients across four inpatient sites is represented. The time
period studied preceded the finding that immunosuppression
improves clinical outcomes in patients with severe COVID-19,26
and steroids were administered at the discretion of the treating
providers. Knowledge of the initial CRP concentration by the
admitting physician may have altered subsequent patient care and
could confound outcomes. Although data on steroid use were not
available, few patients were likely to receive steroids prior to the
initial CRP measurement during hospitalization. In some cases, steroids or tocilizumab, an IL-6 inhibitor, were administered to critically ill patients. However, the timing of drug administration,
duration of use, and dosing of these agents were not recorded in
this dataset. Venous thrombo-embolism was determined according to treating physicians based on available clinical imaging and laboratory data, and were not independently adjudicated. Finally,
only in-hospital outcomes were recorded, and associations between CRP and long-term outcomes following discharge could not
be determined.
