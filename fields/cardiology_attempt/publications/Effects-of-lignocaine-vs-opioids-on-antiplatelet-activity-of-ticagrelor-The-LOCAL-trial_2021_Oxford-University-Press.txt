Aims

We assessed the impact of intravenous fentanyl and lignocaine on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of
ticagrelor in patients with unstable angina and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction and their procedural analgesic
efficacy and safety.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
Seventy patients undergoing coronary angiography with ticagrelor loading were included in the pharmacokinetic
and results
and pharmacodynamic analyses of this randomized trial. Plasma ticagrelor levels 2 h post-loading dose were signifi-

cantly lower in the fentanyl arm than in the lignocaine treatment arm (598 vs. 1008 ng/mL, P = 0.014). The area
under the plasma-time curves for ticagrelor (1228 vs. 2753 ng h/mL, P < 0.001) and its active metabolite (201 vs.
447 ng h/mL, P = 0.001) were both significantly lower in the fentanyl arm. Expression of activated platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor (2829 vs. 1426 mean fluorescence intensity, P = 0.006) and P-selectin (439 vs. 211 mean fluorescence intensity, P = 0.001) was significantly higher at 60 min in the fentanyl arm. A higher proportion of patients
had high on-treatment platelet reactivity in the fentanyl arm at 60 min using the Multiplate Analyzer (41% vs. 9%,
P = 0.002) and 120 min using the VerifyNow (30% vs. 3%, P = 0.003) and VASP (37% vs. 6%, P = 0.002) assays. Both
drugs were well tolerated with a high level of patient satisfaction.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusions
Unlike fentanyl, lignocaine does not impair the bioavailability or delay the antiplatelet effect of ticagrelor. Both
drugs were well tolerated and effective with a high level of patient satisfaction for procedural analgesia. Routine
procedural analgesia during percutaneous coronary intervention should be reconsidered and if performed, lignocaine is a beneficial alternative to fentanyl.

Introduction
Opioids remain the analgesic agent of choice in managing myocardial
ischaemic pain. However, retrospective studies have raised concerns
regarding potential interactions between opioids and oral P2Y12
inhibitors, which are a cornerstone of therapy in myocardial infarction.1-7 One of the proposed mechanisms is opioid-induced gastroparesis leading to impaired gastrointestinal absorption of oral P2Y12
inhibitors.8 Biochemical studies have demonstrated that opioids reduce the bioavailability and antiplatelet activity of all oral P2Y12 inhibitors.9-11 Due to the pharmacological interaction and the potential
clinical implications of early oral P2Y12 inhibitor treatment failure, the
search for alternative analgesic agents to opioids has attracted major
interest.
Intravenous (IV) lignocaine has been shown to be effective for ischaemic limb pain, has a rapid onset of action, short half-life, potential
gastrointestinal prokinetic properties, and is generally well tolerated,
including in patients with coronary artery disease.12-14

Trial design including inclusion/exclusion criteria, randomization and intervention details, safety and efficacy endpoints, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic endpoints, and follow-up endpoints. IV, intravenous; NRS, numerical rating scale; NSTEMI, non-STelevation myocardial infarction.

Patients aged 18 years and over presenting with UA or NSTEMI undergoing coronary angiography were eligible for inclusion in the study. A
diagnosis of UA or NSTEMI was based on documentation by the treating
clinical team, review of cardiac biomarkers, and 12-lead electrocardiograms with compatible symptoms meeting American Heart Association/
American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC)-defined UA and NSTEMI
criteria.15 The exclusion criteria for the study included patients with any
of the following: out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, ST-elevation myocardial
infarction (STEMI), cardiogenic shock, morphine or opioid administration
in the preceding 24 h or regular use, patients with a known coagulopathy
or bleeding diathesis, allergy to fentanyl or lignocaine, bradycardia defined
as heart rate <50 b.p.m. or evidence of atrioventricular block, ticagrelor,
or other P2Y12 inhibitor use in the preceding 10 days, or oral
anticoagulation.
Randomization was performed in permuted blocks of 20 with an allocation ratio of 1:1 contained within sealed, opaque envelopes. The envelopes also contained instructions on dosing and administration of the
drug. The envelopes were only opened by the treating cardiac catheterization laboratory staff once the coronary angiography case commenced.
The envelopes with treatment allocation were discarded at the end of
the case. The investigators responsible for blood sampling, ascertainment
of pain scores, platelet function testing and pharmacokinetic analysis
were blinded to treatment allocation. Participants were also blinded to
treatment allocation.
The Alfred Hospital Human Research and Ethical Committee
reviewed and approved the LOCAL study protocol (reference 258/19).
The study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the
Declaration of Helsinki (2000). All participants provided signed informed
consent prior to the commencement of coronary angiography. The study
protocol was registered prospectively on the Australian and New
Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12619000648123). Identifiable
data underlying this article cannot be shared publicly due to the need to
maintain the privacy of individuals that participated in the study. Deidentified data will be shared on reasonable request to the corresponding

..
.. Study procedures
.. Participants were enrolled between February 2020 and December 2020
..
.. inclusive (see Figure 1 for study design and intervention). Provision of IV
.. midazolam as procedural sedation at the start of coronary angiography
..
.. was at the discretion of the interventional cardiologist. Participants
.. randomized to the fentanyl citrate (100 mg/2 mL, Hospira Australia) arm
.. received 0.75 mg/kg of IV fentanyl at the start of the case if under 70 years
..
.. of age, otherwise 0.5 mg/kg was given at the start of the case. If further an.. algesia was required during the case, IV fentanyl boluses were given at the
..
.. discretion of the interventional cardiologist. Intravenous fentanyl
.. 0.5 mg/kg was given at the end of the case.
..
Participants randomized to lignocaine hydrochloride (100 mg/5 mL-
..
.. 2%, Pfizer Australia) received 1 mg/kg (maximum dose of 100 mg) as a
.. slow IV push over 2 min at the start of the case with a further 0.5 mg/kg
..
.. given at the discretion of the cardiologist if further analgesia was required
.. during the case. If satisfactory analgesia was not achieved after this, the pa.. tient crossed over to fentanyl. Otherwise, administration of opioid anal..
.. gesia was avoided in this arm.
..
Patients with an indication for dual antiplatelet therapy and no contra..
.. indication were given 180 mg of ticagrelor orally as integral tablets with
.. 250 mL of tap water at the end of the case. Patients who did not require
.. dual antiplatelet therapy were included for the ascertainment of pain
..
.. scores and safety only. If glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa inhibitors were admin.. istered at the discretion of the interventional cardiologist, participants
..
.. were included in the analysis; however, the antiplatelet effect of ticagrelor
.. could only be assessed by the VASP assay, which is specific to P2Y12 re.. ceptor inhibition and unaffected by downstream inhibition of the GPIIb/
..
.. IIIa receptor.16
..
At the end of the case, participants were asked to rate their pain on
..
.. the 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS) at the start of the case, worst

administration of ticagrelor with the first 5 mL of blood discarded to
avoid spontaneous platelet activation.
Follow-up phone contact was made at 30 days post-study enrolment
to ascertain the occurrence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE)
defined as a composite endpoint of death, non-fatal myocardial infarction,
target vessel revascularization, as well as patient satisfaction defined by
whether patients were satisfied with the level of analgesia provided during
their procedure and their willingness to receive the same analgesic agent
for future procedures.

Pharmacokinetic analysis was undertaken by investigators blinded to
treatment allocation. Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry
was utilized to measure plasma concentrations of ticagrelor and its active
metabolite AR-C124910XX at all sampling points using methodology
adapted from Xu et al.17 with modifications.
Samples were processed using protein precipitation method; in brief,
20 mL of each plasma sample was mixed with 10 mL of methanol, 40 mL of
acetonitrile, and 10 mL of methanol containing ticagrelor internal standard
(Ticagrelor d7, Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, USA). Analysis was
conducted on an Agilent 6495C in conjunction with an Agilent 1290
HPLC unit with a ZORBAX eclipse plus C18 column (2.1 mm  100 mm
1.8 lm, Agilent). Solvent A comprised of water with 10 mM ammonium
formate, whilst solvent B was 100% acetonitrile running at a flow rate of
0.5 mL/min. The following chromatography conditions were used: starting at 35% B, this was held for 0.5 min before ramping up to 65% B after
0.1 min. Over 1.2 min this was then linearly increased to 90% B, held at
90% for 0.5 min before ramping down to 35% B after a further 0.1 min.
The column was equilibrated back to starting conditions over 1.1 min.
The following source conditions were used: gas temp, 150 C, gas flow
rate 17 L/min, nebulizer at 20 psi, sheath gas temperature at 200 C, and
sheath gas flow at 10 L/min. The instrument was operated in negative ionization mode running multiple reaction monitoring. The transitions used
were: ticagrelor, 521.3/361.3 with a collision energy (CE) of 24 and
Ticagrelor-d7, 528.3/368.3 with a CE of 24.
As we were unable to source a deuterated internal standard for ARC12490XX, we monitored for the metabolite using two sets of transitions. The quantifier ion was 477.3/477.3 with a CE of 0, whereas the
qualifier transition was 466.3/361.5 with a CE of 21. The quantifier ion
was used to determine the concentration relative to the ticagrelor internal standard (quantifier ion measured as 528.3/528.3 with CE of 0) to obtain more accurate quantitation.

Pharmacodynamic assessment
Platelet function testing utilized the point of care assays VerifyNow (VFN;
Accumetrics, San Diego, CA, USA) and Multiplate Analyzer (MPA; Roche
Diagnostics International Ltd, Rotkreuz, Switzerland), flow cytometry
including the VASP assay, assessment of P-selectin expression on the
platelet surface, and GPIIb/IIIa activation. Except for the VASP assay,
which was only utilized for the 2-h time point, all other assays were used
to measure platelet function at all study time points. Whole blood was
collected in citrate tubes for the pharmacodynamic analysis except for
analysis using the MPA where hirudin tubes were used. The first 5 mL of
blood was discarded to avoid spontaneous platelet activation.
The VFN point of care assay was used with the P2Y12 cartridge to
measure platelet reactivity (expressed as platelet reactivity units; PRU).
The VFN is a point-of-care test conducted using whole blood analysed by
recording light transmittance through blood samples in response to the
platelet agonist adenosine diphosphate (ADP). The cartridges contain fibrinogen-coated beads to allow activated platelets within whole blood to
agglutinate and increase light transmittance through the sample.

..
The MPA measures impedance through a sample of whole blood in re..
.. sponse to ADP as a measure of platelet aggregation. Impedance through
.. the sample measured by electrodes in sample wells rises with rising plate..
.. let aggregation. Briefly, diluted whole blood collected in hirudin tubes is
.. added to sample wells with sample warmed to 37 C followed by addition
..
.. of ADP as the agonist. Platelet aggregation was measured as the area
.. under the impedance curve over a time period of 6 min (expressed as
.. AUC).
..
..
For all flow cytometry assays, 10 000 platelets were gated after identifi.. cation of platelets by side and forward scatter. All samples were proc..
.. essed through a BDFACS Fortessa X-20 cytometer (Firmware version
.. 1.4 BD, Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) with events captured using
.. BDFACS Diva software (Version 8.0.1, BD, Biosciences). Sample analysis
..
.. was performed using FlowJoTM for Windows (version 10.7.1, BD,
.. Ashland, OR, USA).
..
We used flow cytometry to assess P-selectin and the activation of
..
.. GPIIb/IIIa with and without ADP stimulation. To achieve this, 50 lL of
.. whole blood diluted in 2450 lL of phosphate-buffered saline was stimu..
.. lated, or not, with 20 lM ADP (final concentration). Samples were simul.. taneously stained in the same tube with 10 lL anti-CD62P
..
.. R-Phycoerythrin conjugated antibody (BD, clone AC 1.2) and 5 lL anti.. activated GPIIb/IIIa (BD, clone PAC-1) for 15 min. Following this, samples
.. were fixed with 1 Cell-Fix. Samples were then acquired on the flow
..
.. cytometer.
..
Finally, we assessed platelet P2Y12 receptor inhibition using the stand..
.. ardized VASP kit assay (Biocytex, Marseille, France) as previously
.. described.18 Briefly this is achieved by incubating whole blood with either
.. prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) alone or in addition to ADP. Samples were fixed
..
.. after which platelets were permeabilized and labelled with serine 239.. phosphorylated VASP monoclonal antibody or an isotype control.
..
.. Following this, samples were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-con.. jugated polyclonal goat-anti-mouse antibody. Platelet reactivity index
.. (PRI) was expressed as a percentage by calculating geometric mean fluor..
.. escence index of phosphorylated VASP in samples treated with PGE1
.. alone compared to PGE1 th ADP.
..
..
High platelet reactivity was defined as PRI >50%, AUC >46 units, and
.. PRU >208 as previously determined for the VASP, MPA, and VFN plate..
.. let function tests, respectively.19
..
..
.. Study outcomes
.. The pre-specified primary endpoint was plasma ticagrelor concentration
..
.. at 2 h in the lignocaine compared to the fentanyl arm in an intention-to.. treat analysis. The secondary study endpoints were (i) area under the

Comparisons between categorical variables were performed using
Fisher's exact test. An intention-to-treat analysis was undertaken for
all study endpoints. Two-sided P-values <0.05 were considered
significant.

Results
Of 90 patients enrolled, 70 had an indication for dual antiplatelet
therapy (Figure 2). All 90 patients were included in the analysis of analgesic efficacy and safety.
Platelet function testing and pharmacokinetic analysis were performed for the 70 patients who were administered ticagrelor loading
at the end of the procedure with 35 patients in each arm. Baseline
characteristics are presented in Table 1 for the 70 patients included in
the primary analysis and were not significantly different between the
two arms. Complete pharmacokinetic data were obtained for all 70
patients. In terms of platelet function testing, complete data were
obtained for the VASP assay in all 70 patients. For the remaining
platelet function assays, complete data for 69 out of 70 patients were

.. obtained except the P-selectin assay where complete data were avail..
.. able for 68 out of 70 patients.
..
Medication prescription in both arms was similar during the
..
.. procedure (Table 2). All patients in the trial were treated with as..
... pirin. Use of IV midazolam (fentanyl 37% vs. lignocaine 46%,
.. P = 0.47) as routine procedural sedation and median unfractio.. nated heparin (fentanyl 9000 IU vs. lignocaine 8000 IU, P = 0.17)
..
.. doses for the procedure were similar between groups. The mean
.. (standard deviation) total IV fentanyl dose was 99 (29) mg whilst
..
.. the mean IV lignocaine dose was 85 (24) mg. Radial access was
.. used predominately, with similar percentages in both study arms
..
.. (fentanyl 91% vs. lignocaine 97%, P = 0.3). Of the patients adminis.. tered ticagrelor, there was no difference in the proportion of

intervention. Overall patient satisfaction with procedural pain relief
was 94% in the fentanyl arm and 97% in the lignocaine arm (P = 0.56).

Discussion
This is the first study to our knowledge that tests IV lignocaine as an
alternative analgesic agent for procedural analgesia in patients undergoing coronary angiography and PCI. Our study demonstrates that
the use of IV lignocaine avoids the biochemical impact of IV fentanyl,
which reduces early plasma ticagrelor levels and its early antiplatelet
effect. We found comparable pain scores and that both drugs were
well tolerated, with a high level of patient satisfaction in both groups
(Graphical abstract).
Consistent with a study by Ibrahim et al.,10 our study demonstrates
that fentanyl interferes with the absorption and early antiplatelet effect of ticagrelor. This effect is consistent in the multi-modality

Pain scores as reported by NRS were not significantly different at the
beginning of the case between the fentanyl and lignocaine arms in the
90 patients enrolled in the study (2 vs. 1, P = 0.97; Table 3). Initial
reported pain was predominately attributed to sheath insertion. Final
pain scores, which were predominately related to sheath removal,
were also not significantly different between the lignocaine and fentanyl arms (1 vs. 0, P = 0.073). There was no difference between maximal pain NRS scores and pain NRS score 2 h post-procedure.
Ischaemic chest pain was experienced in two patients in the fentanyl
arm and three patients in the lignocaine arm. Two patients in the lignocaine arm crossed over to fentanyl due to intolerable ischaemic
chest pain during the procedure despite administration of two lignocaine doses.

Follow-up was complete in all patients administered ticagrelor in the
study at 30 days. There were five patients in the fentanyl arm and six
patients in the lignocaine arm with an unplanned readmission within
30 days (Table 4). Four patients in both groups were readmitted with
non-cardiac complaints and subsequently discharged from the emergency department with negative troponin levels. One patient in the
fentanyl arm re-presented to hospital with complete heart block
3 days post-PCI, which was not deemed to be related to the study
intervention. One patient in the lignocaine arm was noted to have an
acute reduction in haemoglobin at day 1 post-procedure, which was
managed without requiring blood transfusion. One patient in the lignocaine arm had an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest 2 weeks after

platelet function testing at the 30- and 60-min time points for all
assays conducted. The VASP and VFN assays demonstrated a greater
proportion of patients with HTPR at 2 h post-ticagrelor loading dose
in the fentanyl arm.
Baseline platelet reactivity assessed by the MPA was significantly
higher in the lignocaine arm than in the fentanyl arm; however, this
finding was not replicated in any other assay. This most likely reflects
inter-individual assay-related variability in platelet reactivity in the
investigated patient population. A prior ex vivo study utilizing thromboelastography found evidence of impaired coagulation with incremental lignocaine concentrations added to whole human blood;
however, these findings need to be reproduced.21 The baseline platelet function results prior to ticagrelor loading in our study overall do
not demonstrate any intrinsic antiplatelet effect of lignocaine when
stimulated by ADP.
The delay in the gastrointestinal absorption of ticagrelor due to
fentanyl in our patient population only affected the early antiplatelet
response shortly after PCI. Previous trials have shown that

therapeutic platelet inhibition is particularly delayed in patients with
STEMI compared to more stable patients and that opioids further
delay antiplatelet effects in the acute setting.22-24 In a higher risk
population, early treatment failure may be far more relevant. We
previously identified a dose-dependent association between opioid
dose and myocardial infarct size in a retrospective substudy analysis
of the AVOID randomized controlled trial involving a STEMI population.25 The clinical significance of this interaction, however, has been
more challenging to elucidate, primarily as all published studies are
retrospective in nature and the overall quality of the evidence is limited, with significant influence from confounding factors.26 Ultimately,
only prospective randomized controlled trials will be able to provide
definitive answers on whether this biochemical interaction is clinically
significant. However, in order for this to occur, a viable alternative analgesic agent is needed.
Fortunately, there are several promising agents available and an
increasing interest to evaluate their suitability in treating ischaemic
chest pain.8 Lignocaine has been compared to a range of analgesic

Lignocaine performed favourably to morphine in critical limb ischaemia and renal colic with significant reductions in pain and rapid onset
of action within 15 min.27,28 It is also well tolerated without significant
hypotension or bradyarrhythmias at doses of 1-2 mg/kg.13,29 In addition, a Cochrane review of lignocaine use as a prophylactic antiarrhythmic agent in STEMI was not associated with an increased risk of
bradycardia, cardiogenic shock, or hypotension when compared to
placebo.14 This is consistent with our current study where lignocaine

was well tolerated as procedural analgesia. In addition, a recent study
demonstrated that IV acetaminophen resulted in a similar reduction
in pain scores compared to opioids in the prehospital management of
patients with suspected STEMI.30
Our present study demonstrated that pain scores in our stable
population were relatively low and similar between patients receiving
fentanyl and lignocaine when both agents were used as procedural
analgesia. We chose a relatively stable, pain-free population to avoid
the impact of recent opioid administration prior to coronary angiography (which formed part of the exclusion criteria), which may

otherwise have influenced the pharmacokinetic analysis as the primary endpoint of the present study. As a result, most of the pain
reported related to obtaining arterial access and sheath removal rather than ischaemic chest pain, which was experienced in only two
patients in the fentanyl arm and three patients in the lignocaine arm.
Given the identified biochemical interaction and the relatively low
pain scores during the procedure, we believe it is time to re-evaluate
the role of opioids as routine procedural analgesia in stable patients
undergoing coronary angiography, which is commonplace in
Australia and North America.31 Whilst we did not have a placebo
arm to evaluate pain scores without any analgesia, the finding that
most of the discomfort related to radial sheath insertion and removal
suggests more liberal use of local anaesthetic may remove the need
for routine premedication with opioid analgesia. In addition, IV lignocaine could be used to manage pain as required.
In terms of adverse events, lignocaine and fentanyl were well tolerated. We did not see an increased risk of bradyarrhythmias, tachyarrhythmias, or neurological toxicity at the doses of lignocaine used in
the study. There was a trend towards higher rates of nausea and
vomiting requiring antiemetic therapy in the fentanyl arm; however,
this did not achieve statistical significance in contrast to previously
reported studies.32 There were no significant differences in clinical
outcomes at follow-up in the two arms, although it has to be noted
that this study was not powered to assess clinical endpoints and the
sample size was relatively small. We will evaluate the safety of lignocaine at higher doses in our complementary prehospital trial in a
population of patients with suspected STEMI.33
For the current study, we excluded unstable patients with STEMI,
cardiogenic shock or out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. However, in
these patients, morphine is often given at high doses. Given that our
present study demonstrates that IV opioids, in contrast to lignocaine,
impair bioavailability and antiplatelet effects of oral P2Y12 inhibitors, a
prospective randomized trial comparing lignocaine as an alternative
to opioids in patients presenting with suspected STEMI has been initiated by us and is currently ongoing.33 This trial will evaluate the efficacy of lignocaine for moderate-to-severe ischaemic chest pain (NRS
>_5/10) and also the safety of lignocaine in the prehospital setting in a
suspected STEMI population. We hope that both trials will be complementary in providing valuable information regarding the utility of
lignocaine as an alternative analgesic agent to opioids.
In addition to considering alternative non-opioid analgesic agents,
other strategies to mitigate the opioid-oral P2Y12 inhibitor interaction have been explored. These include utilizing metoclopramide
as a prokinetic agent,34 which appears promising, whilst IV

.. methylnaltrexone as a peripheral opioid antagonist does not.35,36 In
