An 80-year-old man with hypertension was referred
to the geriatric department for oedema of lower
extremities. Electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrated
complete left bundle branch block with poor progression of V1-V4 R-wave, low voltage of limb.
Lead (Panel A). Troponin T (TnT) increased
slightly. Echocardiography demonstrated the anterior dysfunction, left ventricular hypertrophy
(Supplementary material online, Video S1).
Coronary computed tomography disclosed mild
stenosis of the left anterior descending artery
(Panel B). Coronary artery disease was excluded.
Further investigations were carried out:

strated increased left ventricular and right ventricular wall thickness (Panel C), late gadolinium
enhancement from subendocardial to transmural (Panel D).
Negative serum and urine protein electrophoresis ruled out monoclonal gammopathy.
Cardiac scintigraphy with 99m Technetium
Pyrophosphate (TC-99m PYP) showed grade 3
tracer uptake on planar imaging, increased heart
to contralateral chest ratio of 1.6 (Panels E
and F).
Endomyocardial biopsy revealed positive
Congo Red staining (Panel G), characteristic
'apple green' birefringence on polarized light microscopy (Panel H). Immunohistochemistry of transthyretin amyloid (TTR) was positive
(Panel I), Lamda-, APO- were negative which suggested transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM).
TTR genetic testing was performed, but no mutation was found. Wild-type ATTR-CM was confirmed.

In addition to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and loop diuretic, the patient prepared to receive taranmidis to stabilize
transthyretin.
ATTR-CM is often misdiagnosed. For the patients with ventricle thickening and segmental dysfunction, it should be suspected even if
with elevated TnT. TC-99m PYP could serve as a non-invasive way to distinguish the amyloidosis subtypes for its high consistency with
biopsy. Emerging therapies that stabilize TTR have been shown to improve the prognosis.
