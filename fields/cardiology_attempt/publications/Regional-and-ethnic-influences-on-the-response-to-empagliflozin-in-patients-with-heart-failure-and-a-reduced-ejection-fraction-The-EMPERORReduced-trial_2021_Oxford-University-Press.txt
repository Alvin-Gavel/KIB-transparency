Aims

The aim of this article is to explore the influence of region and race/ethnicity on the effects of empagliflozin in the
Empagliflozin Outcome Trial in Patients with Chronic Heart Failure and a Reduced Ejection Fraction (EMPERORReduced) trial.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
Of 3730 patients, 1353 (36.3%) were enrolled in Europe, 1286 (34.5%) in Latin America, 425 (11.4%) in North
and results
America, and 493 (13.2%) in Asia; 2629 (70.5%) were White, 257 (6.9%) Black, and 672 (18.0%) Asian. Placebo
event rates (per 100 patient-years) for cardiovascular death or heart failure (HF) hospitalization varied by region
(Asia 27.7, North America 26.4, Latin America 21.4, and Europe 17.5) and race/ethnicity (Black 34.4, Asian 24.3,
and White 18.7); driven by differences in HF hospitalization. The ratio of total HF hospitalization to cardiovascular
death varied from 5.4 in Asia and 4.8 in North America to 2.1 in Europe; and from 4.8 in Black and 4.2 in Asian to
2.2 in White patients. Groups with the highest ratio had the greatest reduction in the primary outcome with empagliflozin. Inclusion of outpatient worsening HF episodes added more events in Europe vs. other regions; enhanced
the placebo event rates in Europe vs. other regions; and increased the relative risk reduction with empagliflozin in
Europe from 6% to 26%.

Regional and ethnic influences on the response
to empagliflozin in patients with heart failure
and a reduced ejection fraction: the
EMPEROR-Reduced trial

4443

Regional and ethnic influences

Conclusions

There were notable differences in the placebo event rates for major HF events across diverse regions and race/
ethnic groups. The benefit of empagliflozin was most pronounced in groups with the highest ratio of HF hospitalization to cardiovascular death. Regional differences were attenuated when the definition of HF events was
expanded to include outpatient worsening HF events.

Introduction
Regional and racial/ethnic differences in the incidence of and
outcomes related to heart failure (HF) have been reported in both
observational studies and global clinical trials.1 These regional and
ethnic differences may reflect differences in patient characteristics,
comorbidities, medical practice, and healthcare delivery.2-4
In the Empagliflozin Outcome Trial in Patients with Chronic
Heart Failure and a Reduced Ejection Fraction (EMPERORReduced), we previously reported regional and race/ethnicityrelated differences in the effect of empagliflozin on the risk of cardiovascular death and HF hospitalization in patients with chronic
HF and a reduced ejection fraction, with and without diabetes.5
The treatment effect appeared to be more pronounced in North
America, Latin America, and Asia (relative risk reduction of 30-

50%) than in Europe (relative risk reduction of 6%). Black and
Asian patients experienced a greater risk reduction with empagliflozin than White patients (40% vs. 12%).5,6 In a meta-analysis of
two trials of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors
in HF and a reduced ejection fraction, the regional and race/ethnicity-related heterogeneity was still apparent.6 However, the definition of regions was based on arbitrary geographical groupings,
and the contribution of differences in background medications,
healthcare systems, and medical practice to this heterogeneity
remained unexplored.
In the present study, we provide an in-depth study of the regional
and racial/ethnic differences in the EMPEROR-Reduced trial, with a
particular emphasis on the role of HF hospitalizations and outpatient
HF events in influencing estimates of the magnitude of the effect of
empagliflozin.

Methods
The EMPEROR-Reduced trial was a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, and event-driven study, whose design
has been described previously.5 Participants were men or women
with chronic HF [New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional
class II, III, or IV] with a left ventricular ejection fraction of <_40%.
Patients with an ejection fraction of <_30% were preferentially enrolled
by requiring those with a higher ejection fraction to have been hospitalized for HF within 12 months or to have markedly increased levels
of N-terminal prohormone B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP),
i.e. >_1000 or >_2500 pg/mL in those with an ejection fraction of
31-35% or 36-40%, respectively; these thresholds were doubled in
patients with atrial fibrillation. The Ethics Committee of each of the
520 sites in 20 countries approved the protocol, and all patients gave
written informed consent.

Randomization and endpoints
Patients were randomized double-blind (in a 1:1 ratio) to receive
placebo or empagliflozin 10 mg daily, in addition to their usual therapy. The primary endpoint was the composite of adjudicated cardiovascular death and hospitalization for HF, analysed as a time-to-first
event. The first secondary outcome was the occurrence of all adjudicated hospitalizations for HF (including first and recurrent events).
To capture out-of-hospital worsening HF events, we analysed an
extended composite outcome of the time-to-first cardiovascular
death, hospitalization for HF, urgent visits for worsening of HF
requiring intravenous therapy, and outpatient intensification of oral
diuretic therapy.7

Definitions of region and race/ethnicity
The countries participating in the EMPEROR-Reduced trial were prospectively but arbitrarily grouped into regions: Latin America, North
America, Europe, Asia, and 'Other' (which included India and Australia).
Race/ethnicity was self-identified as White, Black, Asian, and 'Other' (native American, Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, and any subject who selected
more than one race/ethnicity category).

Statistical analysis
Baseline characteristics were compared between regions and race/ethnicity using ANOVA for continuous variables and chi-square test for
categorical variables. For time-to-first-event analyses, differences between the placebo and empagliflozin groups were assessed using a
Cox proportional hazards model, with pre-specified baseline

.. covariates of age, sex, geographic region, diabetes, left ventricular
..
.. ejection fraction, and estimated glomerular filtration rate, based on all
.. randomized patients according to the intention-to-treat principle. For
..
.. the analysis of total (first and recurrent) events, between-group differ.. ences were assessed using a joint frailty model, with cardiovascular
.. death as a competing risk. For all efficacy measures, treatment-by-sub..
.. group (region and race/ethnicity) interaction terms were included in
.. the models and the effect of empagliflozin was estimated for the cor..
.. responding subgroups. All analyses were performed using SAS, version
.. 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).

..
..
.. Distribution by region and race/ethnicity
..
.. Of the 3730 patients in the EMPEROR-Reduced trial, 1353 (36.3%)
.. were enrolled in Europe, 1286 (34.5%) in Latin America, 425 (11.4%)
..
.. in North America, 493 (13.2%) in Asia, and 173 (4.6%) from India and
.. Australia. Of these, 2629 (70.5%) were White; 257 (6.9%) were
..
.. Black; 672 (18.0%) were Asian; and 114 (3.1%) were classified as
.. 'Other'. As expected, most Asian patients were from Asia; Black
..
.. patients were primarily recruited in Latin America (n = 154) and
..
.. North America (n = 100), whereas White patients were primarily
.. enrolled in Europe (n = 1281), Latin America (n = 1026), and North
..
.. America (n = 301) (Table 1).
..
..
.. Patient characteristics by region and
.. race/ethnicity
..
.. When compared with other regions, patients from Europe and
..
.. North America were older, had worse NYHA functional class, a lon.. ger duration of HF, worse renal function and were more likely to
..
.. have coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation, but had lower NT.. proBNP levels. Patients from North America were also most likely to
..
.. be receiving an angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor but were
.. least likely to be treated with a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist
..
.. (Table 2). Patients in Asia were most likely to have been hospitalized
.. for HF within 12 months and were least likely to be treated with
..
.. inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system, beta-blockers, mineralo.. corticoid receptor antagonists, or cardiac devices.
..
..
Compared with other race/ethnic groups, Black patients were the
.. youngest and had the highest prevalence of hypertension, but the
..
. most preserved renal function. Asian and other race/ethnic group

Regional and ethnic influences

empagliflozin on the primary and first secondary outcome measures
(Table 3).
When outpatient HF events were included in the extended composite endpoint, the magnitude of the effect of empagliflozin was
amplified in Europe where outpatient events were most numerous
(the hazard ratio declined from 0.94 to 0.74), but the inclusion of outpatient events did not influence the effect size in Latin America or
other regions, where outpatient events were less frequent (Table 3).
A region-by-treatment interaction was apparent, even when adjusting
for baseline covariates reflecting background therapy with drugs and
devices for HF or a recent history of an HF hospitalization (interaction P = 0.031).
The magnitude of the effect of empagliflozin on the primary composite outcome and on total hospitalizations for HF was most pronounced in Black patients (hazard ratios of 0.46 and 0.39,
respectively) and Asian patients (hazard ratios of 0.57 and 0.45, respectively) and least pronounced in White patients (hazard ratios of
0.88 and 0.90, respectively). The treatment-by-race interaction was
P = 0.008 for the primary outcome, P = 0.002 for total hospitalizations for HF and 0.002 for the extended composite outcome (Table
4). Adjusting for baseline covariates reflecting background therapy
with drugs and devices for HF or a recent history of an HF hospitalization did not alter these interactions. Interestingly, the effect of
empagliflozin in Black patients was more pronounced than in White
patients in the two regions where meaningful numbers of both Black
and White patients were recruited (North America and Latin
America) (Supplementary material online, Figure S1). When outpatient worsening HF events were included in the analysis, the effect
size for empagliflozin in White patients increased from 12% to 19%
relative risk reduction.

Discussion
Even though the inclusion and exclusion criteria in the EMPERORReduced trial were standardized, there were notable differences in
the clinical characteristics in patients who were recruited in different
regions and among patients from different racial and ethnic backgrounds. These differences may be related to contrasts in medical
practice and healthcare access that may occur across different
regions (or even within the same city or country). Many of the patterns that we observed in the EMPEROR-Reduced trial are very similar to patterns that have been noted in previous trials and registries.
We were not surprised to find that coronary artery disease (and coronary artery interventions) was particularly common in patients
recruited in North America and Europe. Similarly, it is well-known
that hypertension is particularly prevalent in Black patients and that
atrial fibrillation is more common in White patients. Asian patients
are especially prone to diabetes and to coronary artery disease (the
prevalence of which was nearly as high as in Whites), despite a lower
body mass index. Neprilysin inhibitors are most frequently prescribed in North America (and less frequently prescribed in Latin
America and Asia), whereas mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists
are popular in Latin America. Heart failure device therapy was more
commonly utilized in North America and Europe than in Latin
America or Asia. Many of these differences reflect known associations of cardiovascular risk factors with specific racial groups. Other

and Asian patients had a more pronounced response to empagliflozin (when compared with White patients), regardless of the region in which they were recruited. Intriguingly, as in the case of
region, the magnitude of the benefit of empagliflozin paralleled the
frequency of hospitalizations for HF. The placebo arm ratio of
total HF hospitalizations to cardiovascular death was 4.8 and 4.2
in Black and Asian patients, respectively, and in these racial
groups, empagliflozin reduced the risk of the primary endpoint by
40-55%; in contrast, the ratio of total HF hospitalizations to cardiovascular death was only 2.2 in White patients, and in this cohort, the risk reduction produced by empagliflozin was 12%.
Importantly, the inclusion of outpatient worsening HF events
increased the magnitude of the treatment effect in White patients
to a 19% risk reduction (hazard ratio 0.81; 95% confidence interval 0.71, 0.93), without a meaningful change in the risk reduction
in Black and Asian patients.
Our finding of a race-by-treatment interaction is intriguing, but it is
not clear that it represents a replicable finding. Racial groups are not
homogeneous and varied meaningfully with respect to baseline characteristics, and it is likely that unmeasured confounders may have
contributed to the differences that we observed. A recently published meta-analysis that focused on cardiovascular death (and not
HF hospitalizations) reported a greater effect size in trials with a
higher recruitment of patients from Asia, but this conclusion was
based on a small effect that was discerned by the application of metaregression methods to trials that often had zero events.19 Another
recent meta-analysis reported a greater effect of SGLT2 inhibitors in
Asian patients, but this study did not analyse HF hospitalizations in
the large-scale cardiovascular outcomes trials in type 2 diabetes.20 A
registry report has suggested a smaller treatment effect of SGLT2
inhibitors on HF hospitalizations in Asia than in North America, but
this study used observational methods without the protection of randomization.21 Most importantly, other large-scale randomized trials
in patients with HF and patients with type 2 diabetes did not report
an attenuated effect of SGLT2 inhibitors in general or of empagliflozin
specifically in White patients.22-24 In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME
trial, the hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the effect of
empagliflozin to reduce the risk of a first HF hospitalization were 0.67
(0.49, 0.92), 0.49 (0.18, 1.31), and 0.70 (0.37, 1.33) in White, Black,
and Asian patients, respectively (interaction P = 0.82). This lack of external validation in trials that are comparable in size and design to the
current study suggests that the race-by-treatment interaction found
in EMPEROR-Reduced may not represent a replicable finding, particularly given the multiplicity of comparisons performed in the current trial.
These findings should be considered in the context of the primary
analyses of EMPEROR-Reduced showing robust benefits of empagliflozin on the primary endpoint in the entire study population. Specific
acknowledged limitations include our definition of regions based on
arbitrary geographical groupings and our analysis of race/ethnicity
based on the self-report of participants. Therefore, our results may
not be replicable if different criteria were used to define these patient
subgroups. Certain subgroups (particularly those in categories
labelled as 'other') were small and exceptionally heterogeneous, and
thus, the estimates in these groups were necessarily imprecise. While
outpatient treatment intensification events were not independently
adjudicated, ascertainment of these events was prespecified and

patterns represent differences in the availability of healthcare resources, which encourage the utilization of expensive interventions in
regions that have substantial financial resources to devote to healthcare.8-14
Did these differences in clinical characteristics, medical and device
therapy yield differences in patient outcomes? The rate of total HF
hospitalizations was strikingly different across regions, being nearly
three-fold higher in Asia than in Europe. Specifically, when treated
with placebo, the rate of total HF hospitalization was 41.4 in Asia, but
only 16.3 in Europe, with intermediate rates in the other regions. The
difference in HF hospitalization rates in Asia and Europe was not
related to the severity of the underlying HF, since the values for ejection fraction and natriuretic peptides were similar in the two regions,
and patients recruited in Europe were more likely to have had class
III/IV HF at the start of the trial. Furthermore, the risk of cardiovascular death was identical in Europe and Asia, suggesting a similar severity
of the underlying disease at baseline. However, in a time-to-firstevent analysis, it is noteworthy that the inclusion of outpatient events
provided 62% additional worsening HF events to the primary outcome in the placebo group in Europe as compared with only 35%
additional events in Latin America, 42% in North America, and 58%
in Asia. Thus, worsening HF was more likely to be treated as an outpatient in Europe than in other regions.15,16 These findings suggest
that European physicians prefer to treat worsening HF as an outpatient rather than in a hospitalized setting.7,12,17,18
Differences in the way that worsening HF events are managed in
different regions may influence estimates of the effect of a drug that
reduces the risk of worsening HF events. This is especially true if the
treatment effect is described using time-to-first-event methods that
are applied to composite endpoints; in such analyses, non-fatal events
take precedence over deaths. Empagliflozin reduces the risk of the
composite of hospitalization for HF or cardiovascular death, a benefit
that is determined primarily by its ability to reduce hospitalizations.
Therefore, in a time-to-first-event analysis, the effect of empagliflozin
would be expected to be greater in regions where the ratio of HF
hospitalizations to cardiovascular mortality is higher. The ratio of
total HF hospitalizations to cardiovascular death in the placebo group
was >4 in Asia and North America, and in these regions, empagliflozin reduces the risk of the primary endpoint by 30-45%; in contrast,
the ratio of total HF hospitalizations to cardiovascular death was only
2 in Europe, where the risk reduction produced by empagliflozin was
5%. However, when outpatient events were included in the analysis, the ratio of worsening HF events to cardiovascular death
increased dramatically in Europe, and at the same time, the risk reduction by empagliflozin increased from 5% to 26%. In contrast, an
increase in the estimate of the treatment effect was not seen in
regions where outpatient treatment of worsening HF events was uncommon. Therefore, the modest response to the effect of SGLT2 inhibition on cardiovascular death and HF hospitalization in Europe
appeared to be related to the exclusion of outpatient worsening HF
events from the analysis of the primary endpoint. Many of the outpatient events in Europe were likely treated in a hospital setting in
other geographical regions.
The inclusion of outpatient worsening HF events narrowed, but
did not eliminate, the between-region differences in the effect of
empagliflozin on the primary endpoint of the EMPEROR-Reduced
trial. A region-by-treatment interaction persisted because Black

Conclusions
We observed notable differences in the baseline characteristics, the
placebo event rates for major HF events and the treatment effect
estimates across the diverse regions and racial/ethnic groups that participated in the EMPEROR-Reduced trial. The benefits of empagliflozin were most pronounced in regions and racial/ethnic groups with
the highest ratios of HF hospitalization to cardiovascular death.
Differences among regions and among racial/ethnic groups in the effect size estimates were attenuated when the analyses captured both
outpatient and inpatient worsening HF events.

prospectively collected in the case report form. In addition to the adjudication and characterization of hospitalizations for HF, at each
scheduled study visit, patients were prospectively asked about interval events and about changes in the use of diuretics that reflected the
occurrence of worsening HF since the last visit. We performed multiple statistical tests, which may have increased the possibility of
chance findings. Finally, our analyses were not pre-planned, and thus,
we did not assess socioeconomic status, medical practice, or access
to healthcare, which represent potentially important but unmeasured
confounding variables.
