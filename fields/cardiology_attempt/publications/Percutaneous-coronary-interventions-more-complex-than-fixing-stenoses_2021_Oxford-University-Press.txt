For over 20 years, a combination of aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor has
been the mainstay antithrombotic strategy in patients undergoing
percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).1,2 This drug combination,
referred to as dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), has been proven superior to aspirin alone in preventing cardiovascular events after stent
implantation, although at the expense of increased bleeding.
Contemporary advances in device technologies and pharmacological
strategies have allowed PCI to be extended to older and more vulnerable cohorts. As such, an increasing number of patients undergoing PCI have high bleeding risk (HBR) conditions, which make a
standard DAPT regimen clinically undesirable. The TWILIGHT trial
recently demonstrated that ticagrelor monotherapy after a short
course of DAPT is an effective and safe bleeding avoidance strategy
among high-risk patients undergoing PCI.3-5 This Focus Issue on
Interventional Cardiology contains the Fast Track contribution
'Ticagrelor monotherapy in patients at high bleeding
risk undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention:
TWILIGHT-HBR' by Javier Escaned from the Complutense
University of Madrid in Spain, and colleageus.6 This pre-specified analysis of the TWILIGHT trial evaluated the treatment effects of early
aspirin withdrawal followed by ticagrelor monotherapy in HBR
patients undergoing PCI with drug-eluting stents. After 3 months of
ticagrelor plus aspirin, event-free patients were randomized to
12 months of aspirin or placebo in addition to ticagrelor. A total of
1064 patients (17%) met the Academic Research Consortium definition for HBR.7,8 Ticagrelor monotherapy reduced the incidence of
the primary endpoint of Bleeding Academic Research Consortium
(BARC) 2, 3, or 5 bleeding compared with ticagrelor plus aspirin in
HBR [6.3% vs. 11.4%; hazard ratio (HR) 0.53] and non-HBR patients
(3.5% vs. 5.9%; HR 0.59) with similar relative risk reduction (P for
interaction = 0.67) but a trend towards greater absolute risk

reduction in the former [-5.1% vs. -2.3%; difference in absolute risk
differences (ARDs) -2.8, P = 0.130]. A similar pattern was observed
for more severe BARC 3 or 5 bleeding with a larger absolute risk reduction in HBR patients (-3.5% vs. -0.5%; difference in ARDs -3.0%, P
= 0.008). There was no significant difference in the key secondary
endpoint of death, myocardial infarction (MI), or stroke between
treatment arms, irrespective of HBR status (Figure 1).
The authors conclude that among HBR patients undergoing PCI
who completed 3-month DAPT without experiencing major adverse
events, aspirin discontinuation followed by ticagrelor monotherapy
significantly reduced bleeding without increasing ischaemic events,
compared with ticagrelor plus aspirin. The absolute risk reduction in
major bleeding was larger in HBR than in non-HBR patients. The contribution is accompanied by an Editorial by Zuzana Motovska from
the Charles University and University Hospital Kralovske Vinohrady
in Prague, Czech Republic, and colleagues.9 The authors note that
the TWILIGHT-HBR analysis raises new questions in the field of
antithrombotic therapy management. How should we deal with longterm (>15 months) antiplatelet treatment after PCI? Should we continue with ticagrelor monotherapy, or rather switch to clopidogrel or
aspirin? Or even aspirin plus rivaroxaban? Before deciding, it is essential that the patients' risk profile is re-evaluated. It should also be
emphasized that carefully considering the patient's preference, whose
compliance with treatment fundamentally affects its benefits, is crucial
when deciding on the long-term treatment plan.
The value of elective coronary revascularization plus medical therapy over medical therapy alone in managing stable patients with coronary artery disease is debated.10-12 In another Fast Track Clinical
Research article entitled 'Cardiac mortality in patients
randomized to elective coronary revascularization plus
medical therapy or medical therapy alone: a systematic review and meta-analysis', Eliano Navarese from the University of
Alberta in Canada, and colleagues reviewed all trials comparing the
two strategies in this population.13 From inception through

Issue @ a Glance

November 2020, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Google Scholar, and other
databases were searched for randomized trials comparing revascularization against medical therapy alone in clinically stable coronary artery disease patients. Treatment effects were measured by rate ratios
(RRs) with 95% confidence intervals, using random-effects models.
Cardiac mortality was the pre-specified primary endpoint.
Spontaneous MI was a secondary endpoint. The longest follow-up
data were abstracted. Twenty-five trials involving 19 806 patients
(10 023 randomized to revascularization plus medical therapy and
9783 to medical therapy alone) were included. Compared with medical therapy alone, revascularization yielded a lower risk of cardiac
death (RR 0.79, P < 0.01) and spontaneous MI (RR 0.74, P < 0.01),
while all-cause mortality (0.94, P = 0.11) and any MI (P = 0.14) did not
differ significantly between strategies.
The authors conclude that in stable coronary artery disease
patients, randomization to elective coronary revascularization plus
medical therapy leads to reduced cardiac mortality compared with
medical therapy alone. The cardiac survival benefit after revascularization improves with longer follow-up times and is associated with
fewer spontaneous MIs. The article is accompanied by an Editorial

by William Boden from the Boston University School of Medicine
and David Brown from the Washington University School of
Medicine in the USA.14 Boden and Brown highlight that trial-level
meta-analysis of agnostically selected studies with minimal clinical and
statistical heterogeneity that assess relevant, patient-centric endpoints can provide accurate, objective, and clinically meaningful estimates of the effect size of one therapy vs. another. The authors hope
readers of this paper will be both circumspect and wise in interpreting the totality of evidence that should inform our beliefs and
decision-making in the guideline-endorsed management of chronic
coronary syndrome (CCS) patients-namely, an 'optimal medical
therapy (OMT) first' approach to reduce symptoms and events and
one which considers revascularization only for improvement of quality of life in those whose symptoms are either unresponsive or refractory to OMT.
Fractional flow reserve (FFR)-guided revascularization, as compared with angiography-guided PCI, improves the outcome.15 The
utility of measuring FFR after PCI is less certain, but post-PCI FFR values are reported to be inversely associated with adverse cardiac
events. In a third Fast Track Clinical Research article entitled 'Post-

stenting fractional flow reserve vs. coronary angiography
for optimization of percutaneous coronary intervention
(TARGET-FFR)', Damien Collison from the University of Glasgow
in the UK, and colleagues note that TARGET-FFR is an investigatorinitiated, single-centre, randomized controlled trial to determine the
feasibility and efficacy of a post-PCI FFR-guided optimization strategy
vs. standard coronary angiography in achieving final post-PCI FFR values >_0.90.16 After angiographically guided PCI, patients were randomized 1:1 to receive a physiology-guided incremental optimization
strategy (PIOS) or a blinded coronary physiology assessment (control
group). The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with a
final post-PCI FFR >_0.90. Final FFR <_0.80 was a prioritized secondary
outcome. A total of 260 patients were randomized. In the PIOS
group, 30.5% underwent further intervention (stent post-dilation and/
or additional stenting). There was no significant difference in the primary endpoint of the proportion of patients with final post-PCI FFR
>_0.90 between groups (P = 0.099). The proportion of patients with a
final FFR <_0.80 was significantly reduced when compared with the
angiography-guided control group (-11.2%, P = 0.045).
The authors conclude that over two-thirds of patients had a
physiologically suboptimal result after angiography-guided PCI. An
FFR-guided optimization strategy does not significantly increase the
proportion of patients with a final FFR >_0.90 but it does reduce the
proportion of patients with a final FFR <_0.80 (Figure 2).

conclude that Collison et al. should be congratulated for completing
a well-performed randomized trial on the important question of
post-PCI physiology. Interventionalists should be encouraged to
make physiological measurements including pullback to identify patterns of disease not only before PCI but also after stenting to understand the physiological effect of their procedure, and to optimize the
results. Whether this will result in an improvement in clinical outcome remains to be demonstrated by larger randomized trials.
Evidence suggests that in some patient categories, such as those
with diabetes mellitus (DM) and/or acute coronary syndromes
(ACS), decision-making on revascularization based on FFR is associated with an excess of cardiovascular events, compared with patients
without such clinical features. It has been proposed that atherosclerosis progression and destabilization of angiographically intermediate
medically treated lesions is considerable, particularly in DM patients,
and responsible for the majority of the adverse events during the follow-up.18-20 In a Clinical Research article entitled 'Thin-cap fibroatheroma predicts clinical events in diabetic patients with
normal fractional flow reserve: the COMBINE OCT-FFR
trial', Elvin Kedhi from the Medical University of Silesia in Poland,
and colleagues sought to understand the impact of optical coherence
tomography (OCT)-detected thin-cap fibroatheroma (TCFA) on
clinical outcomes of DM patients with fractional FFR-negative
lesions.21 The COMBINE OCT-FFR study was a prospective, doubleblind, international, natural history study. After FFR assessment, and
revascularization of FFR-positive lesions, patients with >_1 FFR-

negative lesions (target lesions) were classified in two groups based
on the presence or absence of >_1 TCFA lesion. The primary endpoint compared FFR-negative TCFA-positive patients with FFRnegative TCFA-negative patients for a composite of cardiac mortality,
target vessel MI, clinically driven target lesion revascularization, or unstable angina requiring hospitalization at 18 months. Among 550
patients enrolled, 81% patients had >_1 FFR-negative lesions. Among
FFR-negative patients, 25% were TCFA positive and 75% were TCFA
negative. The incidence of the primary endpoint was 13.3% and 3.1%
in TCFA-positive vs. TCFA-negative groups, respectively (P < 0.001).
The Cox regression multivariable analysis identified TCFA as the
strongest predictor of MACE (major adverse clinical events) (HR
5.12; P < 0.001).
The authors conclude that among DM patients with >_1 FFRnegative lesions, TCFA-positive patients represent 25% of this population and are associated with a five-fold higher rate of MACE despite
the absence of ischaemia. This discrepancy between the impact of
vulnerable plaque and ischaemia on future adverse events may represent a paradigm shift for coronary artery disease risk stratification in
DM patients. This manuscript is accompanied by an Editorial by
Rasha Al-Lamee from Imperial College London and Gary Mintz from
the Cardiovascular Research Foundation in New York.22 The authors
conclude that we may need to move away from the concept that ischaemia is the major driver of events and consider that it is only a surrogate for the burden of atherosclerosis. The contribution of plaque
morphology to future events needs to be considered. More study is
needed to direct its detection, and effective treatment strategies
need to be developed.
In a Clinical Research article entitled 'Ticagrelor monotherapy in patients with chronic kidney disease undergoing
percutaneous coronary intervention: TWILIGHT-CKD'
Giulio Stefanini from the Humanitas University in Milan, Italy, and
colleagues sought to assess the impact of chronic kidney disease
(CKD) on the safety and efficacy of ticagrelor monotherapy among
patients undergoing PCI.3 In this pre-specified subanalysis of the
TWILIGHT trial, the authors evaluated the treatment effects of
ticagrelor with or without aspirin according to renal function. A
total of 1111 patients (16.3%) had CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min/1.73 m2). Ticagrelor plus placebo reduced
the primary endpoint of BARC type 2, 3, or 5 bleeding as compared with ticagrelor plus aspirin in both patients with (4.6% vs.
9.0%; HR 0.50) and without (4.0% vs. 6.7%; HR 0.59; P for interaction = 0.508) CKD, but the absolute risk reduction was greater in
the former group. Rates of death, MI, or stroke were not significantly different between the two randomized groups irrespective
of the presence or absence of CKD.
Stefanini and colleagues conclude that among CKD patients undergoing PCI, ticagrelor monotherapy reduces the risk of bleeding without a significant increase in ischaemic events as compared with
ticagrelor plus aspirin. The contribution is accompanied by an
Editorial by Robert Storey and William Parker from the University
of Sheffield in the UK.23 The authors conclude that further insights
may be gained from the ongoing Duration of Dual Anti-Platelet
Therapy (DUAL-ACS, NCT03252249) trial that is planning to randomize 19 000 patients with ACS to 3 or 12 months of DAPT,
