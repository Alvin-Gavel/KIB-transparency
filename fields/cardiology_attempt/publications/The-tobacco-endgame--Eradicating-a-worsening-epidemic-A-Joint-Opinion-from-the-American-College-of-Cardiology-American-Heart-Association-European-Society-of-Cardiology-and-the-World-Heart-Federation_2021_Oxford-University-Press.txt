Problem
Tobacco use continues to be a primary contributor to the global
burden of disease, causing an estimated 12% of deaths worldwide
among people >_30 years of age.1 Annually, tobacco kills 8 million
people around the world, including 1.2 million non-smokers who
are exposed to second-hand smoke.2 Globally, 21% of adults, >1
billion people, are current smokers, and >80% of the world's
smokers live in low- and middle-income countries. Most adult
smokers report wanting to quit, but too many find it challenging to
quit successfully. To further reduce smoking worldwide, the
World Health Organization (WHO) aims to support 100 million
smokers in quitting for good through the 'Commit to Quit' campaign launched on World No Tobacco Day.3 Greater global
efforts are needed to build on the WHO's goals and drive us
more rapidly towards a tobacco endgame.
Despite global reductions in tobacco use,4 the introduction of
electronic cigarettes and other newer tobacco products with flavourings is dramatically impacting tobacco use in youth in certain parts of
the world. In Europe, rates of e-cigarette use among 13- to 15-year
olds are highest in Poland (23.4%), Ukraine (18.4%), Latvia (18.0%),
and Italy (17.5%).5 In the USA, where government regulation of

electronic cigarettes is nascent, the rate of youth use of electronic
cigarettes has increased significantly. In 2020, >3.6 million adolescents
in the USA used electronic cigarettes, including 19.6% of young people in grades 10-12.6 Heated tobacco, nicotine pouch products, and
other emerging tobacco products typically include sweet, minty, and
other nontobacco characterizing flavours and pose risks to global
health, particularly among the young.
With this joint opinion, the American Heart Association (AHA),
World Heart Federation, European Society of Cardiology, and
American College of Cardiology call for greater action on a global
scale to end the tobacco epidemic once and for all. Governments
must take more immediate action to implement the WHO's
MPOWER7 framework, which outlines six essential policy strategies
proven to reduce tobacco use, as contained in the WHO
Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. To help accelerate
progress made through WHO's 'Commit to Quit' campaign, countries must fund comprehensive tobacco prevention strategies that
allow full implementation of the MPOWER framework.
Furthermore, governments must effectively regulate electronic cigarettes and other emerging tobacco products to protect young people and improve public health. The figure provides a summation of
the current situation and the need for action Figure 1.

with it, as well as a proposed pathway to eradication of the tobacco epidemic.

Nicotine, tobacco use, and health
Nicotine and health
Although most tobacco-related morbidity and mortality is attributable to other chemicals, nicotine is the main addictive substance in tobacco products that keeps individuals using tobacco and continuing
their risk for suffering tobacco-related harms. As such, the concept of
nicotine addiction and its consequences, in terms of harmful tobacco
product use, should be central to regulatory and policy approaches
to reduce tobacco use.
Nicotine poses risks to the cardiovascular system, including causing an increase in blood pressure, heart rate, flow of blood to the
heart, and a narrowing of the arteries. Nicotine may also contribute
to the hardening of the arterial walls, which in turn can lead to a heart
attack. Nicotine also impacts brain development and poses dangers
to youth, pregnant women, and the developing fetus.8 Nicotine exposure during adolescence can cause addiction and harm the developing brain. During pregnancy, nicotine can cross the placenta and
result in multiple adverse consequences, including sudden infant
death syndrome.
A greater understanding of the impacts of nicotine on cardiovascular health, and nicotine delivery products on children and youth, is necessary to inform further treatment and regulatory approaches to
nicotine. Towards that end, the AHA committed $17 million9 in early
2020 to fund research regarding the adverse health effects of nicotine
and to identify more effective treatment interventions to help young
people quit nicotine products.

Combustible cigarettes and health
The deleterious health consequences of cigarette smoking are very
well established. Smoking combustible cigarettes negatively impacts
nearly every organ of the body,10 and the life expectancy of cigarette

.. smokers is roughly 10 years less than non-smokers.11 Globally, smok..
.. ing and exposure to second-hand smoke are responsible for roughly
.. 1 in 5 (21%) of all deaths attributed to coronary heart disease.
..
.. Tobacco use also increases risk associated with emerging diseases; as
.. a recent example, available evidence suggests cigarette smoking is
..
.. associated with increased severity of disease and death in hospitalized
..
12
.. patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Because the
.. use of combustible tobacco products is the leading cause of prevent..
.. able mortality and morbidity, substantially reducing such use repre.. sents one of the most significant opportunities to improve global
..
.. health.
..
..
.. Electronic cigarettes and health
.. Long-term epidemiological studies of the individual and public health
..
.. impact of e-cigarettes are challenging because these products have
.. evolved rapidly since their emergence in the mid-2000s. In its com..
.. prehensive review, the US National Academies of Science,
.. Engineering, and Medicine stated there is 'conclusive evidence that in
..
.. addition to nicotine, most e-cigarette products contain and emit nu.. merous potentially toxic substances' and that potential exposure to
..
.. these toxic substances is highly variable given the range of product
..
.. characteristics and how e-cigarette devices are used.13 Compared
.. with the use of combustible tobacco cigarettes, a very high-risk com..
.. parator, e-cigarette use likely poses less risk. However, there is grow.. ing evidence that e-cigarettes and their aerosol constituents, nicotine,
..
.. vapourizing solvents, particulate matter, metals, and flavourings can
.. have deleterious effects on the cardiovascular system,14 respiratory
..
.. system,15 and brain.16
..
Although the long-term health effects on adults are unclear, e-cig..
.. arette use among youth poses a clear threat to public health. In the

. unprecedented,17 and millions of young people who would never

Novel tobacco products and health
Heated tobacco, nicotine pouch products, and other novel tobacco
products loosely represent an emerging class of tobacco products
being marketed by industry as reduced-exposure or modified-risk
products. There is currently limited evidence regarding either the
long-term individual health risks posed by these products or their potential public health impact. Heated tobacco products contain nicotine and other potentially harmful constituents, and the potential of
reduced exposure does not mean they are harmless or inherently
related to reduced risk. Nicotine pouch products are one of the fastest-growing segments of the retail tobacco market in the USA, and
there are strong concerns regarding their accessibility to and use by
youth. Governments should introduce and enforce strong systems
for thorough premarket assessment of any novel products and prevent industry from making health claims about products that are not
substantiated by rigorous research and not authorized through regulatory review. Tobacco control interventions, such as MPOWER,
should be applied to all tobacco products.

The role of flavours
Although several countries, including the European Union, USA, and
Canada, have restricted the sale of certain flavoured tobacco products, greater action must be taken to ensure flavoured tobacco products are not increasing tobacco-related disparities and promoting
youth initiation. For instance, in Singapore, multiple menthol cigarette
brands were introduced in the 1980s to appeal to young smokers,
and in 2018, menthol cigarettes represented 48% of the overall market.21 In the Philippines, where menthol cigarette use is high, cigarettes
with flavour capsules have become increasingly popular.22 Today,

roughly half of all US youth who smoke cigarettes report using menthol cigarettes,23 and an estimated 86% of Black smokers and 46% of
Hispanic smokers smoke menthol cigarettes compared with only 29%
of White smokers. Countries should follow the lead of the European
Union, which has prohibited the sale of menthol cigarettes through
the EU Tobacco Products Directive. Newer tobacco products,
including e-cigarettes, heated tobacco, and nicotine pouch products,
are sold in a wide range of youth-appealing flavours. Greater global action must be taken to remove all youth-appealing and other nontobacco characterizing flavours from all tobacco products.

Opportunity for global impact
There is tremendous potential to equitably reduce cardiovascular disease by implementing population-based tobacco prevention and control strategies. Implementing the WHO MPOWER framework
effectively reduces tobacco use among adults and youth.24 Raising the
price of tobacco products, through excise taxes and other means, and
youth-targeted countermarketing campaigns effectively reduce tobacco use among youth.25 With these evidence-based strategies available, the WHO is monitoring progress towards a global target of a
30% relative reduction in tobacco use prevalence by 2025. Similarly,
the AHA is working towards an ambitious tobacco endgame goal of
5% or less tobacco use prevalence in the USA.26 Unfortunately, current rates of tobacco use suggest these goals will not be met without
stronger policy development and implementation.
An estimated 780 million adult smokers worldwide want to quit,3
and the WHO's 'Commit to Quit' campaign aims to support 100 million of them in quitting successfully. Greater efforts must be made to
support adult smokers who want to quit through treatment interventions and through policy measures that create supportive environments for cessation.
Evidence is clear that e-cigarettes pose a significant global health
threat through dramatic increases in youth tobacco and nicotine use.
Many countries have banned the commercialization of e-cigarettes
and heated tobacco products using the precautionary principle (i.e.
that the introduction of a new product or process whose ultimate
effects are unknown should be deferred until scientific evidence of its
safety is available) as justification. The International Union Against
Tuberculosis and Lung Disease has outlined a strong rationale for
why low- and middle-income countries should ban the sale of all electronic nicotine delivery systems entirely.27 Globally, more effective
regulation of online sales of e-cigarettes and e-liquids is needed to
make e-cigarettes less accessible to youth. Actions must be taken
quickly in countries where e-cigarettes are widely used if we are to reduce youth nicotine addiction and tobacco use while providing access
to comprehensive, evidence-based cessation services as a safer alternative for adults who wish to quit smoking combustible cigarettes.

Addressing the challenge: the role
of American Heart Association
and its partners
The AHA, World Heart Federation, American College of
Cardiology, and European Society of Cardiology are committed

have used cigarettes or other tobacco products are using e-cigarettes. The introduction of high-nicotine delivery systems such as
JUUL transformed the e-cigarette landscape and increased the addiction potential for young people. E-cigarette use is also associated
with increased odds of smoking combustible cigarettes among adolescents who had no previous intention of smoking conventional cigarettes,18 belying assertions that e-cigarettes play a major role in
reducing overall nicotine and tobacco use.
Evidence is limited regarding the efficacy of e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation aid.13 Many e-cigarette users also continue to smoke
cigarettes, and dual use of e-cigarettes while continuing to smoke
traditional cigarettes is not associated with higher rates of quitting.19
A 2020 Cochrane review found only moderate evidence that quit
rates were higher among those randomly assigned to receive nicotine
e-cigarettes compared with nicotine replacement therapy and among
those randomly assigned to receive nicotine e-cigarettes compared
with nonnicotine e-cigarettes;20 however, these findings were based
on only a few large randomized clinical trials. More research is
needed to understand the efficacy of e-cigarettes in promoting quitting relative to approved pharmacotherapies. Additional work is also
required to assess the prevalence and impact of dual use, whether
the use of newer tobacco products is more likely to lead to complete
abstinence from combustible tobacco use, and whether these products and e-cigarettes have adverse health effects if they are continued
long-term.

to ending the global tobacco epidemic through advocacy for policies proven to reduce tobacco use and by encouraging bolder
government actions to protect public health. Together and with
other global partners, we continue to monitor and draw attention
to tobacco industry practices that promote its addictive and deadly
products. Recognizing the tremendous toll that combustible tobacco products have on global health, we call for stronger government actions that more rapidly reduce the use of combustible
tobacco products. Towards this aim, we support lowering nicotine
concentrations in all combustible tobacco products while ensuring
the next generation is not addicted to new nicotine delivery
products.
The MPOWER framework and decades of experience in tobacco
control provide a road map to achieving the tobacco endgame. We
are calling on governments to raise the price of tobacco products to levels that effectively promote adult cessation and substantially reduce
youth initiation. Eliminating the sale of menthol cigarettes and other
flavoured tobacco products is essential to eradicating the global tobacco epidemic, and governments should eliminate the sale of all tobacco products with characterizing flavours to substantially reduce youth
initiation and address tobacco-related disparities. Governments
should protect people from tobacco smoke by enacting comprehensive
smoke-free policies, including combustible, heated tobacco, and electronic products, for all indoor public places. To the extent possible
under existing legal frameworks, governments should establish and enforce comprehensive bans on tobacco industry advertising, promotions, and
sponsorships. Effective pictorial health warnings should be included on
all tobacco product packaging, and where possible under existing
legal frameworks, plain/standardized tobacco product packaging
should be used.
We will also advocate for additional and more robust research to
identify additional strategies that help established tobacco users quit
successfully, with a particular focus on youth. We expect the same
rigour of research and regulation to be applied to all products claiming efficacy in helping adults quit. For instance, well-designed clinical
trials of any products with cessation potential, such as e-cigarettes,
must be conducted under and reviewed by relevant drug administration laws and agencies.
Finally, governments must take greater actions to restrict or prohibit
the sale of tobacco products while ensuring established tobacco users
have the support needed to quit successfully.
