Aims

M. Bonaccio et al.

To evaluate the association of ultra-processed food (UPF) intake and mortality among individuals with history of
cardiovascular disease (CVD) and analyse some biological pathways possibly relating UPF intake to death.

Conclusion
A diet rich in UPF is associated with increased hazards of all-cause and CVD mortality among individuals with prior
cardiovascular events, possibly through an altered renal function. Elevated UPF intake represents a major public
health concern in secondary CVD prevention.

Introduction
The health impact of food processing has become a relevant and
timely topic given the increasing volume of industrially processed
food worldwide. Processed food constitutes a large part of the
world's food consumption; the proportion of food that is ultraprocessed is almost 60% in the USA and in the UK,1,2 42% in
Australia,3 and about 24% and 17% in Mediterranean countries such
as Spain4 and Italy,5 respectively. The term ultra-processed foods
(UPF) indicates formulations generally including five or more and usually many ingredients, mostly of cheap industrial sources of dietary
energy and nutrients plus additives, using a series of processes and
containing minimal whole foods.6
Within epidemiological research, NOVA (a name, not an acronym)
is the most widely used food classification based on degree of processing and was originally conceived to overcome limitations pertaining to
traditional nutrition approaches focussed exclusively on nutrients.6,7
Recently, a direct association between consumption of UPF and
risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) was described in the
well-established Framingham Offspring cohort.8 Such results align
with recent evidence that diets rich in UPF likely lead to higher hazard
of mortality and disease in the general population,9,10 possibly
through mechanisms that include poor nutritional content of these
foods, food structure, cosmetic additives, neo-formed compounds,
and contact materials.11 Whether consumption of UPF predicts mortality and CVD outcomes in individuals with a history of CVD
remains to be established.
Although high consumption of UPF has been reportedly associated
with an increased risk of metabolic conditions, such as obesity, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia,12 and a decline in renal function,13 only few
epidemiological studies so far have addressed longitudinally whether
such altered conditions possibly mediate the relation between UPF
and adverse health outcomes.9

To fill this knowledge gap, we first aimed to disentangle the associ..
.. ation of UPF intake with all-cause and cause-specific mortality among
..
.. individuals with a history of CVD by analysing data from a large Italian
.. cohort recruited within the Moli-sani Study, taking advantage of a
..
.. long follow-up period; second, we tested blood biomarkers (e.g.
.. markers of renal function) and other known CVD risk factors (e.g.
..
.. blood pressure) as possible parameters on the pathway between
..
.. UPF and all-cause and cause-specific mortality.
..
..
..
.. Methods
..
..
.. Study population
.. We analysed data from the Moli-sani Study, a prospective cohort study for
..
.. the investigation of risk factors for chronic diseases, where we had previ.. ously documented an increased death rate associated with UPF intake.9
..
.. During 2005-10, 24 325 individuals residing in Molise, a region of central.. southern Italy, aged >_35 years were randomly enrolled from city hall regis.. tries by a multistage sampling. Exclusion criteria were pregnancy at the
..
.. time of recruitment, disturbances in mental or decision-making impair.. ments, current poly-traumas or coma, or refusal to sign the informed con..
.. sent. Thirty percentage of subjects refused to participate and were
.. generally older and had a higher prevalence of CVD and cancer than other
..
.. participants. Further details of the study design are available elsewhere.14
..
From the initial study sample, 1320 reported at enrolment a previous
.. diagnosis
of CVD, including angina, myocardial infarction, revasculariza..
.. tion procedures, peripheral artery disease, and cerebrovascular events.
.. Each self-reported CVD event was confirmed if at least one of the follow..
.. ing criteria was fulfilled: (i) the participant reported the date of admission
.. to the hospital; (ii) reported drug use for ischaemic vascular disease; and
..
.. (iii) presented medical records of ischaemic vascular disease diagnosis.
..
Participants were excluded from the present analyses if they reported
..
.. missing data on diet, implausible energy intake (<800 or >4000 kcal/day
.. in men and <500 or >3500 kcal/day in women) or extreme food intake
.. (<0.5th and >99.5th centiles of total food eaten, and >99.5th of UPF

quency questionnaire. UPF was defined using the NOVA classification according to degree of processing and categorized as quartiles of the ratio (%) between UPF (g/day) and total food consumed (g/day). The mediating effects
of 18 inflammatory, metabolic, cardiovascular, and renal biomarkers were evaluated using a logistic regression
model within a counterfactual framework. In multivariable-adjusted Cox analyses, higher intake of UPF (Q4,
>_11.3% of total food), as opposed to the lowest (Q1, UPF <4.7%), was associated with higher hazards of all-cause
(hazard ratio [HR]: 1.38; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.00-1.91) and CVD mortality (HR: 1.65; 95% CI: 1.07-
2.55). A linear dose-response relationship of 1% increment in UPF intake with all-cause and CVD mortality was
also observed. Altered levels of cystatin C explained 18.3% and 16.6% of the relation between UPF (1% increment
in the diet) with all-cause and CVD mortality, respectively.

interviewers, or missing data on cause-specific death.
We finally analysed 1171 subjects with CVD at baseline. Supplementary material online, Figure 1 shows the flowchart for selection of study
participants.

Outcome ascertainment

Dietary assessment
Food intake during the year before enrolment was assessed by an
interviewer-administered semi-quantitative EPIC food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) validated and adapted to the Italian population,15 for a
total of 188 food items that were classified into 83 pre-defined food
groups on the basis of similar nutrient characteristics or culinary usage.
Using a specifically designed software,16 frequencies and quantities of
each food were linked to Italian Food Tables17 to obtain estimates of daily
intake of macro- and micro-nutrients plus energy.
To estimate UPF, we used the NOVA classification6 that groups foods
into four categories representing levels of processing: (i) fresh or minimally processed foods (e.g. fruit, meat, milk); (ii) processed culinary ingredients (e.g. oils, butter); (iii) processed foods (e.g. canned fish); or (iv) UPF
containing predominantly industrial substances and little or no whole
foods (e.g. carbonated drinks, processed meat, snacks). For the purpose
of these analyses, we used the fourth UPF category.
We summed up the amount consumed (g/day) of each food group
from the fourth category of NOVA (a total of 22 foods and beverages)
and calculated the proportion (%) of UPF in the total weight of food and
beverages consumed (g/day) by creating a weight ratio.
Such approach is more appropriate than energy ratio since it better
accounts for non-nutritional factors pertaining to food processing (e.g.
neo-formed contaminants, additives, and alterations to the structure of
raw foods).18,19 Participants were then divided into quartiles based on
the proportion of UPF food consumed over the total food intake. The full
list of foods categorized according to the NOVA classification is available
as Supplementary material online, Table 1.
Adherence to the traditional Mediterranean diet was defined through
the Mediterranean diet score (MDS) developed by Trichopoulou et al.20

Covariate assessment
Personal history of cancer was self-reported and confirmed by medical
records. Participants were considered to have diabetes, hypertension, or
hyperlipidaemia at baseline if they were taking disease-specific drugs.
Leisure-time physical activity was expressed as daily energy expenditure in metabolic equivalent task-hours for sport, walking, and gardening.

The Moli-sani Study cohort was followed up for mortality until 31
December 2018. Cause-specific mortality was assessed by the Italian
mortality registry, validated by Italian death certificates (ISTAT form), and
coded according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9.
CVD mortality included deaths from diseases of the circulatory system, when the underlying cause of death included ICD-9 codes 390-459.
ICD-9 codes 430-438 were used to define specific cause of death for
cerebrovascular disease, ICD-9 codes 410-414 and 429 for ischaemic
heart disease (IHD).
Cancer death was considered when the underlying cause of death
included ICD-9 codes 140-208. Non-cardiovascular/non-cancer causes
of death were included in the 'other cause mortality' group.
The Moli-sani Study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the
Catholic University (Rome, Italy) and participants provided written
informed consent.

(95% CI) and calculated by using Cox proportional hazards models with
time-on-study as the time scale and adjusting for baseline age as covariate
in the model. Multivariable-adjusted HRs were calculated across quartiles
of UPF, as well as considering the UPF as a continuous variable (1% increase in the proportion of UPF in the diet).

Missing data on covariates (see flowchart in Supplementary material

achieve robust results over different simulations (n = 10 imputed
datasets).
After being selected by subject area knowledge, a biomarker was considered as potentially mediating the association of UPF intake with allcause and cause-specific mortality, if it resulted associated with both the
exposure and the outcome, in accordance with predefined mediation
principles.24,25

These criteria were tested in distinct multivariable regression models
for each potential mediator individually (Supplementary material online,
Table 2) and through Cox models including UPF consumption (continuous) as a covariate (Supplementary material online, Table 3).
For the mediation analysis, we used mediation models (SAS PROC
CAUSALMED) to assess the potential mediation effect of biomarkers on
the association between UPF intake (1% increment of UPF in the diet)
and all-cause and CVD mortality in a counterfactual framework.26
PROC CAUSALMED estimates causal mediation effects and CIs for
the effects based on the maximum likelihood estimates. We utilized 1000
bootstrap resampling to compute CIs of the percentage mediated. The
factors adjusted in the mediation analyses were the same as those in the
main analyses (Model 2).
To test for a potential non-linear, continuous relationship between
UPF and mortality, we used multivariable Cox regression analysis with

Association of UPF intake and mortality among individuals with history of CVD

Results
The analysed population consisted of 377 women (32.2%) and 794
men (67.8%) with a mean age of 66.8 years (min 38.0 to max
74.1 years).
Study participants reported a median of 7.02% [interquartile range
(IQR): 4.7-11.3%] UPF intake in the diet, an average UPF daily intake
of 132.0 g/day (IQR: 65.9-172.8 g), and the average energy from UPF
was 17.8% (IQR: 12.2-22.0%) of the total calories consumed daily.
Food mostly contributing to the total of UPF consumed were processed meat (18.3%), cakes/pies/pastries (11.5%), crispbread/rusks
(11.3%), and non-homemade pizza (10.2%) (Supplementary material
online, Table 1). As compared with subjects with low UPF intake
(Q1), those having high proportion of UPF in the diet (Q4) were
younger, less frequently men, and less likely former smokers, whereas no substantial differences were found for chronic conditions at
baseline.
Adherence to the Mediterranean diet tended to be progressively
lower across quartiles of UPF intake, as well as consumption of fruits
and nuts, vegetables, cereals, monounsaturated (MUFAs) over saturated fats (SFAs), and alcohol, while meat and meat products intake
was higher among those with high UPF intake. Heavy UPF consumers
tended to consume more calories, carbohydrates, sugar, SFA, MUFA,
polyunsaturated fat, and dietary cholesterol while exhibiting lower
consumption of fibre (Table 1).
Regarding CVD risk factors, higher UPF was associated with
increased concentrations of cystatin C and heart rate, and lower levels of HDL-cholesterol (Table 1). Multivariable-adjusted regression
analyses showed that UPF intake was significantly associated with
higher levels of biomarkers of renal function, as well as with diastolic
blood pressure and heart rate, while being inversely related to blood
glucose, total blood, and HDL-cholesterol (Supplementary material
online, Table 2).
After a median follow-up of 10.6 years (IQR: 9.2-11.9 years;
11 536 person-years), a total of 333 all-cause deaths occurred,
including 178 CVD, 114 IHD/cerebrovascular, 80 cancer, and 75
other deaths.
In multivariable-adjusted Model 1, participants in the highest quartile of UPF intake (Q4) had a 46% relatively higher hazard of all-cause
mortality compared with those in the lowest quartile (HR: 1.46; 95%
CI: 1.06-2.00), that was attenuated to 1.38 (95% CI: 1.00-1.91) after
controlling for the traditional MDS (Table 2).

..
CVD mortality increased by 65% (95% CI: 1.07-2.55) in the high..
.. est UPF quartile as compared with the lowest, independently of the
..
.. MDS (Table 2).
..
Increased UPF intake was also directly associated with IHD/cere..
.. brovascular death with a hazard of 1.65 (95% CI: 0.96-2.85) and a sig.. nificant dose-response relation (P for trend = 0.021), while no
..
.. association with cancer death nor mortality from other causes was
..
.. observed (Table 2).
..
Multivariable-adjusted survival curves for all-cause and CVD mor..
.. tality across UPF quartiles are well separated and tend to diverge
.. over time (Figure 1).
..
Accordingly, the multivariable dose-response analysis between a
..
.. 1% increase in the proportion of UPF in the diet and CVD mortality
..
.. showed a direct linear dose-response relationship (P for overall asso.. ciation = 0.0003; P for non-linearity = 0.24). In comparison with the
..
.. reference value of 7.02%, the relative hazard of CVD mortality signifi..
.. cantly increased at proportion of UPF > 10.7% and was almost 50%
.. higher when the proportion of UPF reached 15.4% (Figure 2B).
..
.. Similar findings were observed for all-cause mortality (P for overall
.. association = 0.0028; P for non-linearity = 0.47) (Figure 2A).
..
..
The population attributable risk for CVD mortality associated with
.. the highest UPF intake (Q4) was 8.8% (95% CI: -7.6 to 9.99%) and
..
.. 8.7% (95% CI: -0.5 to 9.97%) for all-cause mortality.
..
..
.. Mediation analysis
..
.. When analysing biological mechanisms potentially linking UPF to all.. cause and CVD mortality, we found that part of such relations was
..
.. explained by altered renal function, with cystatin C concentrations,
.. respectively, accounting for 18.3% and 16.6% of the excess of all..
.. cause and CVD mortality associated with 1% increase in UPF intake
..
.. (Table 3). Heart rate explained 13% of the relationship between UPF
.. intake and all-cause mortality.
..
..
..
..
.. Discussion
..
.. This is possibly the first study to provide evidence that a diet rich in
..
.. UPF, as assessed by the NOVA classification, is independently associ.. ated with an increased hazard for all-cause and CVD mortality among
..
.. adults with pre-existing cardiovascular events (Graphical Abstract).
..
We confirmed our preliminary data showing that a 5% increase in
..
.. the proportion of UPF in the diet led to increased all-cause and CVD
..
.. mortality rates among high-risk individuals such as those with prior
.. CVD or individuals with diabetes over 8.2 years of follow-up.9
..
In this study, we focussed specifically on a sub-population from the
..
.. Moli-sani Study with pre-existing CVD and took advantage from an
..
.. extended follow-up of 10.6 years; moreover, the mediation analysis
.. represents a major novelty of this study.
..
..
Analyses on this sample of 1171 high-risk individuals extend prior
.. evidence from general populations confirming an increased hazard of
..
.. disease/mortality associated with regular consumption of highly proc..
.. essed foods.9,10,18,19
..
Recent findings from the Framingham Offspring cohort on 3000

UPF intake modelled as restricted cubic splines (three knots at 5%, 50%,
and 95% of the UPF distribution)27 and used the median value of UPF
weight ratio (=7.02%) as the reference value.
We calculated the hypothetical population attributable risk, an estimation of the percentage of mortality in the study population during followup that theoretically would not have occurred if all individuals had been in
the low-risk category, assuming a causal relation.
For these analyses, we compared participants in the highest UPF intake
(Q4) with the rest of the population (Q1 th Q2 th Q3).
Statistical tests were two-sided, and P-values < 0.05 were considered
to indicate statistical significance. The data analysis was generated using
SAS/STAT software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).

..
Noticeably, we failed to observe any association between UPF in..

.. is influenced by too many factors, well beyond diet and lifestyles,
..
.. which also include diagnostic practices and prevention strategies that

.. UPF and cancer is inconsistent, with some observational studies sug..
.. gesting that elevated UPF consumption may lead to an increased risk
.. of certain types of cancer, while not being associated with some
..
.. other types.19,42
..
Finally, it is worth noting that the average energy intake from UPF
..
.. in this cohort is in line with estimations from general adult popula.. tions in other Mediterranean countries4,5; this suggests that, although
..
.. CVD individuals in our cohort might have already adopted a healthy
.. dietary pattern following lifestyle advice from their cardiologists, the

.. Strengths and limitations
.. To our knowledge, this appears to be the first study evaluating the as..
.. sociation of UPF intake in secondary CVD prevention, and testing
.. several potentially mediating pathways, as measured by a large set of
..
.. biomarkers.
..
Important strengths of the present study include its prospective
..
.. design, the examination of numerous biomarkers representative of
.. different pathophysiological processes, and the detailed information
..
.. on several dietary, lifestyle, and clinical factors to minimize
.. confounding.
..
..
Yet our findings should be interpreted in light of several limitations.
.. This is an observational study thus causality cannot be inferred, and
..
.. although analyses were controlled for several factors, we cannot fully
.. rule out the potential of residual confounding by unmeasured factors.
..
.. The relatively small sample size, along with quite small mortality cases
.. in some of the categories of UPF, is another critical limitation of this
..
.. study; however, this is a common feature of studies in a secondary
.. CVD prevention setting.43
..
..
The FFQ used in this population was not specifically conceived to
..
collect
data based on the NOVA classification, thus many food items
..
.. were not included (e.g. pre-prepared dishes, energy bars, slimming
..
.. products). Also, dietary data were self-reported and this may lead to
.. recall and selection bias.
..
Another weakness is that diet and health data were measured at
..
.. baseline only; thus, potential changes occurred over life course might
..
.. have modified the strength of the findings; nevertheless, there is
.. some evidence that diet in adulthood tends to remain stable over
..
.. time44 as well as most of the biomarkers here tested were not found
.. to vary substantially over time.45 Also, the FFQ used in this study ena..

The potential adverse health effects of a diet rich in UPF, as
reflected by the NOVA classification, in a secondary CVD setting
have never been addressed to date; while the health advantages associated with a Mediterranean diet have been supported by high-quality
observational studies,29,30 there is scarce evidence indicating that
Western-type diets, typically rich in processed/highly processed
food, may increase the risk of secondary CVD events.31
The inclusion of baseline adherence to a traditional Mediterranean
diet in our analyses only marginally attenuated the magnitude of the
association between UPF and all-cause and CVD mortality, suggesting
that UPF are an independent risk factor for secondary CVD events.
UPF tend to be nutrient poor while representing a major source of
SFA, added sugar, dietary cholesterol, energy density, resulting in an
overall lower nutritional quality of the diet11 that may be partially responsible for the observed detrimental health effects.
Consistently, in our study, people eating larger amounts of UPF
exhibited a lower nutritional profile, although no difference in sodium
intake was observed and this may be due to the lack of data on salt
added during preparation or at the table, or to the fact that UPF include either sweet (e.g. cakes, breakfast cereals, biscuits) or salty
products, the latter being more prevalent in the processed food category (e.g. cheese, ham).
Our analyses were controlled for a measure of overall diet quality
at baseline, as reflected by the Mediterranean diet, which did not substantially alter the association between UPF and CVD mortality, suggesting that the excess of all-cause and CVD mortality associated
with elevated intake of UPF is only partially mediated by an overall
low diet quality, in accordance with others.8
Besides being nutrient poor, UPF are important sources of cosmetic additives (e.g. glutamates, emulsifiers, sulphites) and neoformed compounds (e.g. acrylamide) resulting from food processing
and particularly heat treatments that may promote disease.32
In addition, evidence from mechanistic studies suggests that processing itself actually matters for health and, even with identical chemistry, food structure can make a major difference to biological and
health outcomes.33
Indeed, the greater deconstruction of the original food matrix and
the cosmetic additives added to these products have been associated
with changes in the composition and metabolic behaviour of the gut
microbiota that promote inflammatory diseases.34
Finally, UPF are frequently packaged in materials that are a source
of phthalates and bisphenols, which are multifunctional synthetic
chemicals used to make plastics flexible and durable.35
Studies on the cardiovascular toxicity of plasticizers additives point
to inflammation, oxidative stress, and hormone imbalance as potential mediators,36 and experimental studies have established an association between exposure to plastic chemicals and cardiac
dysfunction.37,38 In addition, bisphenols exhibit nephrotoxicity,39 and
long-term exposure to phthalates is associated with nephropathy
and exacerbates chronic kidney disease progression.40
Regarding biological mechanisms, we found that part of the excess
of all-cause and CVD mortality associated with increasing UPF consumption was likely explained by altered renal function as reflected
by higher concentrations of cystatin C among heavy UPF consumers
as compared with people consuming lower amounts of these foods.
These results align with prior observations from the general population of the Moli-sani Study,9 and are also in agreement with data from

M. Bonaccio et al.

age (continuous), energy intake (continuous), educational level (categorical), housing tenure (categorical), smoking (categorical), body mass index (continuous), leisure-time physical activity (continuous), history of cancer (no/yes), diabetes
(no/yes), hypertension (no/yes), hyperlipidaemia (no/yes), residence (categorical), and Mediterranean diet score (continuous). The proportion refers to 1% increment of ultra-processed food intake. Mediation analyses were generated using
the first imputed dataset. The other imputed datasets were similar and thus omitted.

however, for a small proportion of subjects, it was not possible to
verify their self-reported admission to the hospital when it was the
unique reported criterion to confirm pre-existing CVD.

Moreover, we were unable to address the contribution of nonnutrient factors possibly linking UPF to mortality, such as neo-formed
compounds, plasticizers, and food additives.

Figure 2 Multivariable dose-response association of (A) all-cause and (B) cardiovascular mortality with ultra-processed food consumption (1% increase in the proportion of ultra-processed food in the diet) among 1171 individuals with history of cardiovascular disease from the Moli-sani cohort,
generated using the first imputed dataset. The other imputed datasets were similar and thus omitted. Hazard ratios with 95% confidence interval
were obtained from the multivariable model adjusted for sex, age, energy intake, educational level, housing tenure, smoking, leisure-time physical activity, body mass index, history of cancer, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, residence, and the Mediterranean diet score. Ultra-processed
food consumption was considered as a continuous exposure and the reference value for hazard ratios was 7.02% (median value of the exposure).
The dashed lines indicate 95% confidence bands. Three knots were used, located at the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentiles of the ultra-processed food
intake.

Finally, the usefulness of the NOVA classification is actually
debated since this food classification scheme is not based on unequivocal, distinct physico-chemical aspects of foods and has been
revised and refined over time.46 However, this classification allows
comparison with previous studies and increases the level of evidence.
Caution is needed in generalizing these findings to other populations.

In this cohort of adult individuals with pre-existing CVD, a high proportion of UPF in the diet is associated with an increased hazard of
all-cause and CVD mortality, possibly through mechanisms that include altered renal function. Such association is independent from
the overall diet quality at baseline, as reflected by a traditional
Mediterranean diet.
Although guidelines for CVD prevention generally emphasize consuming minimally processed foods, such as fruits and nuts, vegetables,
whole grains, and fish, they do not explicitly suggest to markedly reduce UPF in the diet47 and the same stands for guidelines for secondary prevention for patients with pre-existing CVD.48
Despite deriving from an observational study in the field of nutrition epidemiology, which is prone to several biases, our data suggest
that excessive consumption of UPF may represent a major public
health concern in secondary CVD prevention and support the need
to stress the importance of limiting UPF in dietary guidelines, as done
in some49 but not in the majority of countries.
Further longitudinal studies with similar designs are warranted to
replicate and potentially confirm these findings in different populations with pre-existing CVD.
