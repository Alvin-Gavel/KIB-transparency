See the editorial comment for this article 'Bringing FIDELITY to the estimate of treatment effects of finerenone in chronic
kidney disease due to type 2 diabetes', by Carly Adamson and Pardeep S. Jhund, https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab827.

Aims

The complementary studies FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) examined cardiovascular and kidney outcomes in different, overlapping stages of CKD. The purpose of the
FIDELITY analysis was to perform an individual patient-level prespecified pooled efficacy and safety analysis across a
broad spectrum of CKD to provide more robust estimates of safety and efficacy of finerenone compared with placebo.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
For this prespecified analysis, two phase III, multicentre, double-blind trials involving patients with CKD and type 2 diaand results
betes, randomized 1:1 to finerenone or placebo, were combined. Main time-to-event efficacy outcomes were a compos-

ite of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure, and a composite of kidney failure, a sustained >_57% decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate from baseline over >_4 weeks,
or renal death. Among 13 026 patients with a median follow-up of 3.0 years (interquartile range 2.3-3.8 years), the composite cardiovascular outcome occurred in 825 (12.7%) patients receiving finerenone and 939 (14.4%) receiving placebo
[hazard ratio (HR), 0.86; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.78-0.95; P = 0.0018]. The composite kidney outcome occurred
in 360 (5.5%) patients receiving finerenone and 465 (7.1%) receiving placebo (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.67-0.88; P = 0.0002).
Overall safety outcomes were generally similar between treatment arms. Hyperkalaemia leading to permanent treatment
discontinuation occurred more frequently in patients receiving finerenone (1.7%) than placebo (0.6%).

Conclusion
Finerenone reduced the risk of clinically important cardiovascular and kidney outcomes vs. placebo across the
spectrum of CKD in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Cardiovascular and kidney outcomes with
finerenone in patients with type 2 diabetes and
chronic kidney disease: the FIDELITY pooled
analysis

475

Cardiovascular and kidney outcomes with finerenone

Key Question
Does finerenone, a novel selective, nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, added to maximum tolerated renin-angiotensin
system inhibition reduce cardiovascular disease and kidney disease progression over a broad range of chronic kidney disease in patients
with type 2 diabetes?

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Key Finding

In a prespecified, pooled individual-level analysis from two randomized trials, we found reductions both in cardiovascular events and kidney failure outcomes with finerenone. Because 40% of the patients had an estimated glomerular filtration rate of >60 mL/min/1.73m2 they
were identified solely on the basis of albuminuria.

Finerenone reduces the risk of clinical cardiovascular outcomes and kidney disease progression in a broad range of patients with chronic
kidney disease and type 2 diabetes. Screening for albuminuria to identify at-risk patients among patients with type 2 diabetes facilitates reduction of both cardiovascular and kidney disease burden.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                   

Structured Graphical Abstract Finerenone reduced the risk of clinically important cardiovascular and kidney outcomes versus placebo

Methods
Study design
This prespecified pooled efficacy and safety analysis, which was prespecified in a formal statistical analysis plan, combines data from FIDELIO-DKD
(NCT02540993) and FIGARO-DKD (NCT02545049), two phase III,
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre clinical trials
(Table 1 and Supplementary material online, Figure S2). Trial design and
study protocol details have been published previously.7,11

Patients
Eligible patients were adults (aged >_18 years) with type 2 diabetes and
CKD treated with a maximum tolerated labelled dose of an angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker
(ARB).

Chronic kidney disease in FIDELIO-DKD
CKD in FIDELIO-DKD was defined as either: (i) persistent (demonstrated at both the run-in and screening visits, which took place between
a minimum of 4 to a maximum of 16 weeks apart), moderately increased
albuminuria (UACR >_30-<300 mg/g) with an eGFR of >_25-<60 mL/min/
1.73 m2 and the presence of diabetic retinopathy, or (ii) persistent, severely increased albuminuria (UACR >_300-<_5000 mg/g) and an eGFR of
>_25-<75 mL/min/1.73 m2.

Chronic kidney disease in FIGARO-DKD
CKD in FIGARO-DKD was defined as either: (i) persistent, moderately
increased albuminuria (UACR >_30-<300 mg/g) with an eGFR of >_25-
<_90 mL/min/1.73 m2, or (ii) persistent, severely increased albuminuria
(UACR >_300-<_5000 mg/g) and an eGFR >_60 mL/min/1.73 m2. Patients
in both trials had to have serum potassium <_4.8 mmol/L at both the runin and screening visits. Other key exclusion criteria included clinical diagnosis of symptomatic chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction
(i.e., a Class IA recommendation for MRA treatment). Inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed in the Supplementary material online, Appendix.

Procedures
The procedures for the FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD studies have
been described previously. Briefly, eligible patients were randomized 1:1
to receive oral finerenone (10 or 20 mg) or placebo. Both studies consisted of run-in, screening, double-blind treatment, and safety follow-up
periods (Supplementary material online, Figure S2).7,10 The run-in period
required ACEi or ARB therapy to be adjusted to a maximum tolerated
labelled dose that did not lead to unacceptable side effects. Study drug
was withheld if potassium concentrations exceeded 5.5 mmol/L and
restarted when potassium levels fell to <_5.0 mmol/L. Further details are
found in the Supplementary material online, Appendix.

Outcomes
The outcome definitions for FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD have
been described previously.7,10 The efficacy outcomes selected for this
analysis were either a primary or a secondary outcome or those prespecified in the hierarchical outcomes in the complementary studies. The efficacy outcomes of interest for this pooled analysis were a composite
cardiovascular outcome of time to cardiovascular death, non-fatal MI,
non-fatal stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure (HHF), and a composite kidney outcome of time to first onset of kidney failure, sustained
>_57% decrease in eGFR from baseline over >_4 weeks, or renal death. In

estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) have a greater lifetime
risk of cardiovascular morbidity such as heart failure, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, or dying from cardiovascular causes.7
Evidence suggests that overactivation of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) leads to inflammation and fibrosis in the heart, kidneys,
and vasculature where the MR is extensively expressed that can drive
CKD and cardiovascular disease progression.8 Finerenone is a novel,
selective, nonsteroidal MR antagonist (MRA) that blocks MRmediated sodium reabsorption and MR overactivation and has demonstrated anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects in preclinical
kidney and cardiovascular disease models.8,9 The FInerenone in
reducing kiDnEy faiLure and dIsease prOgression in Diabetic Kidney
Disease (FIDELIO-DKD) and FInerenone in reducinG cArdiovascular
moRtality and mOrbidity in Diabetic Kidney Disease (FIGARO-DKD)
phase III trials are complementary in nature due to features such as
their similar designs and endpoints. Together, they form the largest
cardiorenal outcomes programme in CKD in type 2 diabetes to
date. They investigated the efficacy and safety of finerenone, on top
of maximum tolerated renin-angiotensin system inhibition, on kidney and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with mild-to-severe
CKD in type 2 diabetes (Supplementary material online, Figure S1).3
In FIDELIO-DKD, finerenone significantly reduced the risk of the
primary kidney composite outcome and the key secondary cardiovascular composite outcome in patients with predominantly stage
3-4 CKD with severely increased albuminuria and type 2 diabetes.7
In FIGARO-DKD, finerenone significantly reduced the primary cardiovascular composite outcome risk in a broader patient population than studied in FIDELIO-DKD (patients with stage 2-4 CKD
and moderately increased albuminuria, or stage 1-2 CKD with severely increased albuminuria).7,10
The FIDELIO-DKD trial was designed to detect a treatment
effect of finerenone on kidney failure endpoints, whereas the
FIGARO-DKD trial aimed to detect an effect on a cardiovascular
composite primary endpoint.7,10 To improve the ability to detect a
treatment effect on the kidney failure outcome, patients with a higher
urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) were preferentially
selected in the FIDELIO-DKD trial. To provide a greater kidney
failure-free interval to detect a treatment effect on cardiovascular
events, in FIGARO-DKD, a population with moderate UACR and a
wider eGFR range was selected. Thus, the two trials complemented
each other with a slight overlap in the populations studied, and their
similar designs and overlapping research sites allowed for the comparison and pooling of their results.
The efficacy and safety of finerenone, however, have not been
fully evaluated across the spectrum of CKD in type 2 diabetes.
The FInerenone in chronic kiDney diseasE and type 2 diabetes:
Combined FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD Trial programme
analYsis (FIDELITY) pools these complementary studies with similar designs, assessments, and conduct. The aim of the FIDELITY
prespecified pooled analysis was to provide more robust estimates of finerenone efficacy and safety across the spectrum of
patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes, to provide reassurance
regarding outcomes in a wide range of patients with a degree of
precision that was not possible to obtain by considering the two
trials separately.

A total of 145 randomized patients (60 patients in FIDELIO-DKD and 85 patients in FIGARO-DKD) were prospectively excluded prior to database lock from all analyses because of critical Good Clinical Practice violations. This affected one site in the USA that was subsequently closed during the conduct of the trial, leading to the exclusion of 66
patients. In addition, during trial conduct, it was detected that several patients were randomized simultaneously at multiple trial sites in the same locality in Florida, USA. This
led to the prospective exclusion of a total of 79 patient IDs.

the composite kidney outcome, kidney failure was defined as end-stage
kidney disease (ESKD) or a sustained decrease in eGFR to <15 mL/min/
1.73 m2, and ESKD was defined as initiation of chronic dialysis (for
>_90 days) or kidney transplantation. Other prespecified outcomes
included: a second composite kidney outcome of time to first occurrence
of kidney failure, sustained >_40% decrease in eGFR from baseline over
>_4 weeks, or renal death; time to all-cause mortality; time to all-cause
hospitalization; and change in UACR from baseline to Month 4.
The eGFR >_40% composite kidney outcome was the primary or secondary outcome in the complementary trials.7,10 However, a sustained
>_57% decrease in eGFR (equivalent to doubling of serum creatinine) was
selected in FIDELITY because it is a classic outcome in diabetic nephropathy studies2,12-14 and is a more robust kidney failure surrogate outcome
than a >_40% decrease in eGFR, particularly when initial changes in eGFR
occur.14,15 This outcome was selected before data pooling and analysis.
Furthermore, the eGFR >_57% outcome was a predefined outcome in the
complementary trials.

Results
From September 2015 through October 2018, 33 292 patients from
48 countries were screened and 13 171 patients were randomized
(Supplementary material online, Figure S3). Critical GCP violations
related to site or patient misconduct resulted in the prospective exclusion of 145 patients (see Supplementary material online,
Appendix), leaving a population of 13 026 patients on whom statistical
analyses were performed.
Patient characteristics, medications, and demographics at baseline
were balanced between patients randomized to finerenone and placebo (Table 2 and Supplementary material online, Table S1; published
previously3). The mean eGFR was 57.6 mL/min/1.73 m2 and median
UACR 515 mg/g. Overall, 10.2%, 41.0%, and 48.3% of patients had
moderate, high, and very high Kidney Disease Improving Global
Outcomes risk scores, respectively (Supplementary material online,
Figure S4). History of cardiovascular disease was reported in 45.6% of
patients. Blood glucose (mean glycated haemoglobin 7.7%) and blood
pressure (mean systolic blood pressure 136.7 +/- 14.2) were moderately well controlled. Baseline cardiovascular medications included
statins, anti-platelets, and diuretics in 72.2%, 56.0%, and 51.5% of
patients, respectively, and renin-angiotensin system inhibition in
99.8% of patients. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1RAs) and sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors
were used by 7.2% and 6.7% of patients, respectively. Medications
started after study drug initiation are summarized in Supplementary

material online, Table S2. The median follow-up period was 3.0 years
[interquartile range (IQR) 2.3-3.8 years].
The composite cardiovascular outcome (time to cardiovascular
death, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, or HHF) occurred in 825
(12.7%) patients receiving finerenone and 939 (14.4%) patients
receiving placebo (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.78-0.95; P = 0.0018; Figures 1
and 2). Significantly lower incidences of HHF occurred with finerenone vs. placebo (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.66-0.92 [P = 0.0030], Figures 2
and 3). Cardiovascular death and non-fatal MI incidences were directionally consistent with the cardiovascular composite outcome; nonfatal stroke was similar with finerenone and placebo (Figures 2 and 3).
Based on a between-group risk difference of 2.2% after 3 years, 46
(95% CI, 29-109) patients would need to be treated with finerenone
to prevent one composite cardiovascular outcome event. Consistent
results were observed in prespecified subgroups (including those
with SGLT-2 inhibitor or GLP-1RA baseline use; Supplementary material online, Figure S5), and a prespecified 'on-treatment' sensitivity
analysis (including all events from randomization up to 30 days after
last intake of study drug) confirmed the results of the main analysis
(Supplementary material online, Table S3). Results for each of the cardiovascular and renal endpoints by individual trial in FIDELITY, including Pinteraction values, are presented in Supplementary material online,
Figure S6.
The incidence of the composite kidney outcome (time to first
onset of kidney failure, sustained >_57% decrease in eGFR from baseline over >_4 weeks, or renal death) was significantly lower with finerenone vs. placebo (Figures 1 and 2), occurring in 360 (5.5%) patients
receiving finerenone and 465 (7.1%) patients receiving placebo
(HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.67-0.88; P = 0.0002); the number needed to
treat based on a between-group risk difference of 1.7% at 3 years was
60 (95% CI, 38-142). Analysis of the sustained >_57% decrease in
eGFR component showed a 30% risk reduction (HR, 0.70; 95% CI,
0.60-0.83; P < 0.0001) and the ESKD component a 20% risk reduction with finerenone vs. placebo (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.64-0.99;
P = 0.040). The prespecified 'on-treatment' sensitivity analysis confirmed the results of the primary analysis (Supplementary material
online, Table S3).
The composite kidney outcome of kidney failure, sustained >_40%
eGFR decrease, or renal death occurred in 854 (13.1%) and 995
(15.3%) patients receiving finerenone and placebo, respectively (HR,
0.85; 95% CI, 0.77-0.93; P = 0.0004; Figures 1 and 2). Incidences of allcause mortality (Figures 1 and 2) and hospitalization for any cause
(Figure 2) with finerenone were not significantly different from placebo (P = 0.051 and P = 0.087, respectively). The mean change in
UACR from baseline to 4 months was 32% lower with finerenone
vs. placebo (ratio of least-squares mean change from baseline,
0.68; 95% CI, 0.66-0.70), an effect maintained throughout the trial
(Supplementary material online, Figure S7A).
Similar incidences of investigator-reported treatment-emergent
adverse events were observed between treatment groups (Table 3
and Supplementary material online, Table S4). Serious adverse events
occurred in 31.6% of patients in the finerenone group and 33.7% of
patients in the placebo group. Renal-related adverse events, including
acute kidney injury, occurred in similar proportions of patients between groups. Hyperkalaemia-related adverse events occurred more
frequently with finerenone (14.0%) vs. placebo (6.9%), but no
hyperkalaemia-related adverse events were fatal and only a small

and >_60 mL/min/1.73 m2), albuminuria category (moderately increased
and severely increased) at screening, and a history of cardiovascular disease (present or absent; see Supplementary material online, Appendix, for
further details). P-values for the comparison of treatment groups are presented based on a stratified log-rank test. Treatment effects are
expressed as hazard ratios (HRs) with corresponding 95% confidence
intervals (CIs) from the stratified Cox proportional hazards models.
Events were counted from randomization up to the end-of-study visit
and patients without an event were censored at the date of their last contact with complete information on all components of the respective outcome. The time-to-event analyses reporting included first events only.
Events based on a sustained decrease in eGFR were considered in the
analysis from randomization up until 5 months after the last eGFR was
recorded at a clinic visit. For subgroup analyses, HRs were derived from
stratified Cox proportional hazards models, including treatment subgroup and a subgroup by treatment interaction term as fixed effects.
Cumulative incidences based on Aalen-Johansen accounting for mortality as competing risk and corresponding numbers needed to treat
were calculated in 6-month intervals for the composite cardiovascular
outcome and the key composite kidney outcome. Cumulative incidences
based on Kaplan-Meier were calculated for all-cause mortality. An ontreatment sensitivity analysis was performed for outcomes considering
only events occurring up until 30 days after study drug cessation in the full
analysis set.
The sponsor, Bayer, conducted the statistical analyses, and all authors
had access to the data and participated in its interpretation. All analyses
were performed using SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary,
NC, USA). Additional statistical methods are found in the Supplementary
material online, Appendix.

Discussion
The pooled analysis of two complementary trials comprising
13 026 patients with a broad spectrum of CKD and type 2 diabetes, all treated with an optimized dose of an ACEi or ARB,7,10
provides robust evidence of both cardiovascular and kidney protection with finerenone vs. placebo. Based on the FIDELIO-DKD
trial results, finerenone is currently indicated to reduce the risk
of sustained eGFR decline, ESKD, cardiovascular death, non-fatal
MI, and HHF in adult patients with CKD associated with type 2
diabetes.7,16 Across the FIDELITY population, the relative risk

reduction was 14% for the composite cardiovascular outcome
and 23% for the composite kidney outcome; cardiovascular outcomes across subgroups by baseline demographics and clinical
characteristics were generally consistent. The results of this analysis provide reassurance regarding the safety and efficacy of
finerenone across a wide spectrum of patients with CKD and
type 2 diabetes with a degree of precision that was previously
not possible to obtain by considering the two trials separately.
MRAs are indicated for the treatment of patients with chronic symptomatic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction17,18-such patients
were excluded from the FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD

studies7,10-but data supporting use of MRAs to reduce the risk of
heart failure developing in patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes are
limited. The FIDELITY analysis provides evidence that finerenone use
in patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes, a population at high risk of
developing heart failure, prevents HHF. In the FIDELITY analysis, HHF
was the main driver of the cardiovascular benefit with finerenone, with
a relative risk reduction of 22% vs. placebo (P = 0.0030), in a population
that excluded patients with chronic symptomatic heart failure with
reduced ejection fraction at the run-in visit.7,10 This finding is important
because heart failure is a major source of morbidity and healthcare
costs among patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes19-21; therefore,
prevention of such events can improve patient outcomes and potentially reduce healthcare costs. Furthermore, the fact that finerenone
lowers HHF risk across the CKD spectrum emphasizes the need to
screen all patients with type 2 diabetes for this risk factor.
The FIDELITY analysis shows not only a 30% reduction in the risk
of a sustained >_57% decrease in eGFR on top of optimized ACEi or
ARB therapy but also a relative risk reduction of 20% in ESKD with
finerenone vs. placebo (P = 0.0403). The relative risks of all components of the kidney composite outcome were reduced with finerenone vs. placebo, except time to renal death (this finding was likely
due to low event numbers, although the HR of 0.53 still favoured
finerenone over placebo). The relative risk of a sustained >_57% decrease in eGFR was reduced by 30%, ESKD by 20%, sustained decrease in eGFR to <15 mL/min/1.73 m2 by 19%, and kidney failure by
16%. The requirement for dialysis is one of the most dreaded

complications of CKD progression22; it is associated with substantial
morbidity and costs.23 Reduction of this outcome, which is of great
relevance to both patients and payers, is therefore notable.
Prior trials of dual renin-angiotensin system blockade have failed
to show cardiovascular or kidney protection among patients with
CKD and type 2 diabetes, suggesting that the way in which the renin-
angiotensin-aldosterone system is blocked is important.24-26 The
FIDELITY analysis suggests a strong effect of MR overactivation in the
pathogenesis of both cardiovascular disease and CKD progression in
patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes.
Previous studies assessing SGLT-2 inhibitors in patients with CKD
and type 2 diabetes, such as CREDENCE or DAPA-CKD, included
patient populations representing a substantially smaller part of the
CKD spectrum than the FIDELITY analysis.2,27 Because the trials differed in population, design, and other aspects described previously,
their results cannot be directly compared with the FIDELITY analysis.7,10 In FIDELITY, 877 patients (6.7%) received SGLT-2 inhibitors
and 944 patients (7.2%) received GLP-1RAs at baseline, and the cardiovascular and kidney benefits of finerenone are at least as large in
patients on SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1RAs as in those without.
Preclinical data on the initial combination of finerenone and empagliflozin in a rat model of hypertension-induced end-organ damage also
showed that the combination approach conferred a protective effect
across various cardiorenal outcomes.28 It is possible that there is an
additive effect of the combination of finerenone on top of SGLT-2
inhibitors or GLP-1RAs, which may relate to their distinct

mechanisms of action. However, this was not a randomized trial of
finerenone and SGLT-2 inhibitor or GLP-1RA combination therapy,
and the efficacy and safety of these agents in combination will be
determined in future clinical trials and analyses.
Owing to its mechanism of action, finerenone treatment is expected
to increase serum potassium concentration through MR antagonism.8
In FIDELITY, hyperkalaemia was more frequent with finerenone vs.
placebo. However, the incidence of hyperkalaemia-related adverse
events with clinical impact was low, with hyperkalaemia-related permanent treatment discontinuation in only 1.7% of patients receiving
finerenone vs. 0.6% with placebo over a median follow-up of 3.0 years
(IQR 2.3-3.8 years). Hypokalaemia occurred less frequently in
finerenone-treated patients than in placebo-treated patients.

Potassium intake was not restricted during the trials, but finerenone or
placebo was withheld in cases where potassium concentrations
>5.5 mmol/L were detected, until potassium concentrations fell to
<_5.0 mmol/L. Therefore, finerenone improves cardiorenal outcomes
in patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes with a manageable hyperkalaemia risk and a reduction in hypokalaemia. The hypokalaemia reduction is notable because it is causatively associated with adverse
outcomes in heart failure.29
Although this prespecified pooled analysis of two studies with similar protocols included a large patient population with CKD and type
2 diabetes, limitations are that it did not include patients with nonalbuminuric CKD and only a small proportion of Black patients were
included. Since the design of the FIGARO-DKD and FIDELIO-DKD

patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes.30 Some patients in the finerenone phase III trials also received these novel agents at study commencement, and consistent cardiovascular benefits were observed in
these groups.
In conclusion, finerenone reduced the risk of clinically important cardiovascular and kidney outcomes vs. placebo across
the spectrum of CKD in patients with type 2 diabetes. The
