This commentary refers to the article 'Cardiac pacing in
severe recurrent reflex syncope and tilt-induced asystole',
by M. Brignole et al., https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/
ehaa936; 'Effectiveness of Closed Loop Stimulation pacing
in patients with cardioinhibitory vasovagal reflex syncope is
questionable', by W. Wieling and D.L. Jardine, https://doi.
org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab157; and the discussion pieces
'Efficacy of the Biosync trial, or when facts prompt a reconsideration of theories', by J.G. van Dijk et al., https://doi.org/
10.1093/eurheartj/ehab376 and 'Efficacy of the Biosync
trial: the information published from this trial to date is not
sufficient to change theory', by W. Wieling and D.L. Jardine,
https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab379.
Two possible reasons can explain syncopal recurrences that were
observed in a minority of patients of the Biosync trial1: one is the late
onset of asystole and the other is the suboptimal pacing.
In his letter,2 van Dijk appropriately addressed the timing of
asystole with respect to the onset of loss of consciousness, which
is relevant. He correctly observed that we did not use the concept
of 'late asystole' in the inclusion criteria of the BIOSync-CLS trial,1
as it may be impractical or difficult to ascertain in many centres.
Agreeably, the inclusion of patients with late asystole may have
reduced the estimated benefit of pacing, thus reinforcing study
results. Indeed, late asystole may represent one of the major
causes of the few syncopal recurrences still observed in the active
study group, despite pacing. In his pivotal study on the temporal relationship of asystole to the onset of transient loss of

consciousness during tilt-induced reflex syncope, Saal and van Dijk
et al.3 observed that late asystole, defined as that occurring three
seconds before the onset of loss of consciousness, or later,
occurred in one-third of subjects. In these patients, the authors
argued that pacing may have little benefit as it would probably start
too late to prevent syncope. It is worth noting that the rate of late
asystole observed by van Dijk is consistent with the 22% syncope
recurrence rate at 2 years observed in the Biosync-CLS trial. This
finding suggests some causal relationship.
In another pivotal study, van Dijk et al.4 convincingly proved
that the onset of cardioinhibition is a real turning point as it is the
marker of activation of the vasovagal reflex, i.e. greater hypotension (sympathetic withdrawal) and bradycardia (vagal output).
On average, cardioinhibition starts 1-2 min before syncope and
7-8 min after vasodepression. At syncope, both reduced stroke
volume and low heart rate contribute to a drop in cardiac output
and blood pressure. Therefore, in order to support blood
pressure during vagal reaction, pacing at an adequately high rate,
as suggested by Kurbaan et al.,5 should cover all this interval. The
analysis of some tilt-tests performed during the Biosync-CLS
study showed that pacing with closed-loop stimulation (CLS)
seems to be perfectly triggered at a sufficiently high rate (90-100
b.p.m.), around the maximum spontaneous heart rate (Figure 1).
However, with the present CLS system, the basic pacing rate
resumes in a short time, when the cardioinhibitory (vagal) reflex
may be still present. Thus, suboptimal heart rate is often delivered
at the time of maximum vagal reaction that is when adequately
high heart rate could prevent syncope. It is advisable that

future devices will offer a programmable pacing decay, able to
maintain an adequately high rate for all the duration of the vasovagal event.
In conclusion, the brilliant theories raised by the two pivotal pathophysiological studies are confirmed by facts (Biosync results). Thanks
for the inspiration.

Figure 1 A case of pacing with closed-loop stimulation during the tilt test. The pacing starts at the very beginning of an impending syncope.
Closed-loop stimulation pacing introduces atrial stimulation at a rate of 88 b.p.m. when spontaneous sinus rate falls from its maximum value of
96 b.p.m. (there is ventricular fusion throughout). The vasovagal reflex continues as shown by the progressive decrease of blood pressure.
The closed-loop stimulation response may be suboptimal in this case. It is expected that the persistence of a pacing rate at 88 b.p.m. or even higher
around 96 b.p.m. for the total duration of the vasovagal reflex would have been helpful in aborting or at least limiting the blood pressure fall. APVP,
