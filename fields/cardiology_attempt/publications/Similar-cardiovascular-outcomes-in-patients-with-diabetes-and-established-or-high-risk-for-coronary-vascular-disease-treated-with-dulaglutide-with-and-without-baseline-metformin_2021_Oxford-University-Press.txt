Objective

Recent European Guidelines for Diabetes, Prediabetes and Cardiovascular Diseases introduced a shift in
managing patients with type 2 diabetes at high risk for or established cardiovascular (CV) disease by recommending GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT-2 inhibitors as initial glucose-lowering therapy. This is questioned since outcome trials of these drug classes had metformin as background therapy. In this post hoc analysis, the effect of dulaglutide on CV events was investigated according to the baseline metformin therapy by
means of a subgroup analysis of the Researching Cardiovascular Events with a Weekly Incretin in Diabetes
(REWIND) trial.

Research design Patients in REWIND (n = 9901; women: 46.3%; mean age: 66.2 years) had type 2 diabetes and either a previous CV
and methods
event (31%) or high CV risk (69%). They were randomized (1:1) to sc. dulaglutide (1.5 mg/weekly) or placebo in
addition to standard of care. The primary outcome was the first of a composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction,
nonfatal stroke, and death from cardiovascular or unknown causes. Key secondary outcomes included a microvascular composite endpoint, all-cause death, and heart failure. The effect of dulaglutide in patients with and without baseline metformin was evaluated by a Cox regression hazard model with baseline metformin, dulaglutide assignment, and their interaction as independent variables. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence
intervals (CIs) were estimated by a Cox regression model with adjustments for factors differing at baseline between people with vs. without metformin, identified using the backward selection.
older and slightly less obese and had higher proportions of women, prior CV events, heart failure, and renal disease. The primary outcome occurred in 976 (12%) participants with baseline metformin and in 281 (15%) without.
There was no significant difference in the effect of dulaglutide on the primary outcome in patients with vs. without
metformin at baseline [HR 0.92 (CI 0.81-1.05) vs. 0.78 (CI 0.61-0.99); interaction P = 0.18]. Findings for key secondary outcomes were similar in patients with and without baseline metformin.

Conclusion
This analysis suggests that the cardioprotective effect of dulaglutide is unaffected by the baseline use of metformin therapy.

A subgroup analysis of the REWIND Trial

Methods
Participants
The REWIND trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT01394952) was a
multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, conducted at 371 sites in 24 countries as previously described in detail.14
Eligible patients were >_50 years old with type 2 diabetes, HbA1c <_9.5%
(<_80 mmol/mol), and BMI >_23 kg/m2 and were on stable treatment for at
least 3 months with 0-2 glucose-lowering drugs, with or without basal insulin. The participants had either suffered a previous cardiovascular event
or had multiple cardiovascular risk factors.14 Exclusion criteria were an
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <15 mL/min/1.73 m2, a history of cancer within 5 years prior to inclusion, any episode of severe
hypoglycaemia in the year prior to inclusion, a life expectancy below 1
year, a coronary or cerebrovascular event within the previous 2 months
or planned revascularization.

Study design
The participants were randomly assigned to 1.5 mg of weekly subcutaneous dulaglutide or to the same volume of placebo.14 They underwent
scheduled visits after 2 weeks, 3 and 6 months and subsequently every 3
months for drug dispensing and every 6 months for a more detailed assessment.11,14 The investigators were encouraged to promote a healthy
lifestyle and defined targets for each cardiovascular risk factor, and they
could add any glucose-lowering medication, apart from another GLP-1
RA or pramlintide, at their discretion, according to local guidelines.

Outcomes
The primary endpoint was the first of a composite of nonfatal myocardial
infarction, nonfatal stroke, and death from cardiovascular or unknown

.. causes (3-point major adverse cardiovascular outcomes, MACE). Three
..
.. key secondary outcomes were analysed: (i) a composite clinical micro.. vascular outcome, including retinopathy due to diabetes (defined as need
..
.. for photocoagulation, anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy, or
.. vitrectomy) or renal disease (defined as development of a urinary
.. albumin-to-creatinine ratio of >33.9 mg/mmol in those with a lower base..
.. line concentration, a sustained 30% or greater decline in eGFR based on
.. two consecutive eGFR assessments or need for chronic renal replace..
.. ment therapy); (ii) all-cause death; and (iii) heart failure requiring either
.. hospital admission or an urgent visit requiring therapy.
..
..
.. Ethics
.. The study complies with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the REWIND
..
.. protocol was approved by research ethics boards at each site. All partici.. pants provided written informed consent. Data monitoring was carried
..
.. out by an independent committee every 6 months.14
..
..
.. Data management and statistical analyses
.. The characteristics of participants according to reported baseline metfor.. min were summarized; categorical variables are reported as count and
..
.. percentages with the corresponding odds ratios (ORs, i.e. the odds of
.. being on metformin in the presence vs. the absence of the variable) while
..
.. continuous variables are reported as mean and standard deviation with
.. the corresponding ORs (i.e. the odds of being on metformin for every
.. unit increase in the value of the continuous variable). Logistic regression
..
.. was used to assess the univariable relationship between the baseline char.. acteristics of interest and baseline metformin use. A multivariable logistic
..
.. regression model was constructed considering all of the univariable pre.. dictors of baseline metformin with a P-value of <0.05 using backward
.. elimination method with the alpha-level of 0.05.
..
..
The estimated effect of dulaglutide on the study outcomes in partici.. pants with and without baseline metformin use was evaluated according
..
.. to the intention-to-treat principle and included all outcomes occurring
.. on or after randomization in the analysis. Kaplan-Meier estimates were
..
.. used to generate cumulative incidence risks and Cox proportional haz.. ards models were used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confi.. dence interval (CI) in each of subgroups of baseline metformin use. The
..
.. interaction between dulaglutide and metformin use at baseline was
.. assessed by including the subgroup and interaction term in the Cox
..
.. model. The effect of dulaglutide on the primary outcome was also eval.. uated by means of an analysis of three subgroups in relation to glucose.. lowering therapy at baseline: drug-naive patients (neither on metformin
..
.. nor on any other glucose drugs); patients on any glucose-lowering drug
.. except metformin; and patients on metformin with or without any other
..
.. glucose-lowering drug.
..
addition, the Cox models were adjusted for the baseline characteris.. ticsInidentified
in the multivariable logistic regression model.
..
..
To investigate whether the use of metformin during follow-up influ.. enced the effect of dulaglutide on the four major outcomes (MACE, all..
.. cause death, microvascular, and heart failure), the hazard of dulaglutide
.. was re-estimated after adjusting for baseline metformin use and metfor..
.. min use as a time-varying covariate (i.e. at the last visit before either the
.. outcome or censorship).

.. Patient characteristics
..
.. A total of 9901 participants were recruited between August 2011
.. and August 2014, of whom 4949 were randomized to dulaglutide

to use either of these agents as first-line glucose-lowering therapy in
people with type 2 diabetes at high risk for or with established cardiovascular disease (CVD).2,3
The high prevalence of concomitant metformin use in participants
in the outcome trials on GLP-1 RAs and SGLT-2 inhibitors has fuelled
uncertainty regarding whether the cardiovascular benefits of these
agents occur in both the presence and absence of metformin.4-11
Therefore, whether the proven cardiovascular benefits of these new
anti-hyperglycaemic drugs require concurrent metformin therapy
remains unknown.2,12,13
In the Researching Cardiovascular Events with a Weekly Incretin
in Diabetes (REWIND) trial, the GLP-1 RA dulaglutide reduced the
risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE, comprising nonfatal myocardial infarction or stroke and cardiovascular death) compared to placebo in people with type 2 diabetes and established CVD
or multiple cardiovascular risk factors.11 A sizeable proportion of the
REWIND participants were without metformin therapy at the time
of randomization, equally in the dulaglutide group and in the placebo
group.11,14 Analyses of the cardiovascular effects of dulaglutide in the
presence and absence of baseline metformin treatment may help
clinicians choose the optimal first-line type 2 diabetes glucoselowering treatment for patients at high cardiovascular risk, both with
and without established CVD.
This post hoc analysis of the REWIND trial tests the hypothesis
that the effect of dulaglutide on cardiovascular events is unaffected by
the use of baseline metformin therapy.

were prescribed metformin and 1864 (19%) were without metformin therapy, with similar proportions in the dulaglutide and placebo

Patients' characteristics are presented in Table 1. Compared to
patients with baseline metformin those without such treatment
included a higher proportion of female participants (49% vs. 45.7%)
and they were older (67.8 years old vs. 65.8), slightly less obese (BMI
31.8 vs. 32.4 kg/m2), with a higher proportion of previous cardiovascular events (24.1% vs. 19.7%), heart failure (12.5% vs. 7.7%), and
renal disease (eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 in 34.5% vs. 19.3%).
Moreover, they had higher use of insulin (30.2% vs. 22.4%) and thiazolidinediones (3.8% vs. 1.2%) but a lower use of statins (61.8% vs.
67.1%) and renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (79.1% vs. 82.0%).

Take home figure In this post hoc analysis of the REWIND trial, the cardiovascular protective effect of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist

type of glucose-lowering therapy (Supplementary material online,
Table S2) and dulaglutide (interaction P = 0.53).
Individuals who were taking baseline metformin differed from
those not on baseline metformin in several ways (Table 1). The effect
of dulaglutide in the presence and absence of metformin was therefore also assessed after accounting for the independent determinants of metformin use listed above. As noted in Figure 1, the
absence of any significant interaction (all interaction P-values >0.1)
provides no support for any differential effect of dulaglutide

according to the baseline metformin use. In particular, there was no
significant difference in the effect of dulaglutide on the primary outcome in patients with or without metformin at baseline [adjusted
HR 0.92 (CI 0.81-1.05) vs. 0.78 (CI 0.61-0.99), respectively; interaction P = 0.18]. The risk for the composite microvascular endpoint,
all-cause death and heart failure was similar in patients treated with
dulaglutide, irrespective of use of baseline metformin both before
and after adjusting for the independent determinants of metformin
use (all interaction P > 0.1).

A subgroup analysis of the REWIND Trial

Kaplan-Meier curves for the primary MACE outcome in people
with baseline metformin are shown in Figure 2A, whereas the corresponding curves for people without baseline metformin are shown in
Figure 2B.
The effect of dulaglutide on the study outcomes was not influenced by the post-randomization use of metformin (Supplementary
material online, Table S3).

This post hoc analysis shows that the cardiovascular and microvascular
outcomes within the REWIND trial were similar in people who were and
were not taking metformin at baseline. Indeed, the absence of any evidence of interaction between dulaglutide use and metformin means that
the best estimate of the effect of the intervention on these outcomes is
the overall effect (e.g. HR 0.88 for MACE). This finding and the absence of
an interaction after adjusting for the independent determinants of metformin use at baseline and the absence of any interaction with respect to the
other key outcomes provide further support for the hypothesis that on
these outcomes are consistent regardless of baseline metformin therapy.
Two additional analyses further strengthened the present findings. The
first showed the absence of interaction when subgrouping the participants
in those who were drug naive, those who received any glucose-lowering
therapy except metformin, and those taking metformin. The second one
showed that post-randomization changes in metformin use did not impact
the effect of dulaglutide on study outcomes.
Considering the lack of a CVOT investigating the effect of metformin vs. placebo on MACE, a subgroup analysis of a superiority
randomized controlled trial represents a reasonable tool to assess
the influence of metformin therapy on the effect of novel antihyperglycaemic agents and to investigate whether such agents maintain their cardioprotective benefit in patients who, by some reason,
are not prescribed metformin.11,14-16 In REWIND, the large dataset,
the broad inclusion criteria comprising both people at risk for and
with established CVD and the superiority trial nature allow insight in
the cardiovascular risk reduction in a heterogeneous group of
patients with type 2 diabetes. In accordance with the present results,
a recent post hoc analysis of the Liraglutide Effect and Action in
Diabetes: Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcome Results (LEADER)
trial identified no clear heterogeneity in the cardiovascular efficacy of
the GLP-1 RA liraglutide in relation to the background use of metformin.17 Similarly, participants with and without metformin at baseline
in the Albiglutide and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with type 2
diabetes and established CVD (Harmony Outcomes) trial had a consistent beneficial effect of the GLP-1 RA albiglutide on the primary
composite cardiovascular outcome. This last report was, however,
limited to a description of the primary outcome in prespecified subgroups, i.e. without any descriptions of or adjustments for dissimilarities in patients with and without baseline metformin.10
The mechanisms responsible for the cardiovascular benefits of
GLP-1 RAs have not been fully elucidated.18 Effects on glycaemic
control, weight, lipid profile, blood pressure control, platelet function, and endothelial changes leading to improved myocardial perfusion have been shown.19-21 Nevertheless, to assess the specific
contribution of each action to the decrease in cardiovascular risk and
to compare it to the respective metformin action would be

..
.. impossible given the nature of the REWIND trial. Therefore, analyses
.. like the present might be the most clinically insightful, while further
..
.. mechanistic speculation on the present results would be
.. inadequate.15,18
..
This study has some limitations. First, the study population is a
..
.. selected trial cohort of people with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovas..
.. cular risk or with established CVD that may not be fully representa.. tive of a wider population of such patients. However, to assess the
..
.. generalizability of different CVOTs results, a recent analysis com.. pared the key characteristics of participants of GLP-1 RAs CVOTs to
..
.. a reference American population who matched the specific entry cri.. teria: encouragingly, the REWIND population resulted as the most
..
.. representative.22 Second, REWIND was not specifically designed to
..
.. assess difference between groups according to baseline therapy;
.. therefore, these results should be considered indicative rather than
..
.. proof of evidence. This is, at least partly, addressed by the absence of
.. any interaction, even after adjusting for independent determinants of
..
.. metformin use at baseline. The consistent results found for the sec.. ondary outcomes should also be interpreted as quality indicators of
..
.. such sensitivity. Nevertheless, it is possible that other baseline char.. acteristics were not included in the models. A third limitation is the
..
.. relatively small proportion of participants without metformin at base.. line, 19%, to a certain extent decreasing the power of the present
..
.. analysis. A final limitation was that the possible effect of the other
..
.. glucose-lowering medications taken by study participants was not
.. characterized.
..
In conclusion, the present data favour the hypothesis that the
..
.. benefit of the GLP-1 receptor agonist dulaglutide is unaffected by the
..
.. use of baseline metformin in a population of patients with type 2 dia.. betes at high cardiovascular risk or with established CVD.
