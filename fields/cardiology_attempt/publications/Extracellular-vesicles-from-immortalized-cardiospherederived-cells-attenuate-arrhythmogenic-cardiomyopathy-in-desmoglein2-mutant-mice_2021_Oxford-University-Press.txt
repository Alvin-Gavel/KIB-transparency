Aims

Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM) is characterized by progressive loss of cardiomyocytes, and fibrofatty tissue replacement. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by cardiosphere-derived cells, immortalized, and engineered
to express high levels of b-catenin, exert anti-inflammatory, and anti-fibrotic effects. The aim of the current study
was to assess efficacy of EVs in an ACM murine model.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
Four-week-old homozygous knock-in mutant desmoglein-2 (Dsg2mt/mt) were randomized to receive weekly EVs or
and results
vehicle for 4 weeks. After 4 weeks, DSG2mt/mt mice receiving EVs showed improved biventricular function (left, P

< 0.0001; right, P = 0.0037) and less left ventricular dilation (P < 0.0179). Electrocardiography revealed abbreviated
QRS duration (P = 0.0003) and QTc interval (P = 0.0006) in EV-treated DSG2mt/mt mice. Further electrophysiology
testing in the EV group showed decreased burden (P = 0.0042) and inducibility of ventricular arrhythmias (P =
0.0037). Optical mapping demonstrated accelerated repolarization (P = 0.0290) and faster conduction (P = 0.0274)
in Dsg2mt/mt mice receiving EVs. DSG2mt/mt hearts exhibited reduced fibrosis, less cell death, and preserved connexin 43 expression after EV treatment. Hearts of Dsg2mt/mt mice expressed markedly increased levels of inflammatory cytokines that were, in part, attenuated by EV therapy. The pan-inflammatory transcription factor nuclear
factor-jB (NF-jB), the inflammasome sensor NLRP3, and the macrophage marker CD68 were all reduced in EVtreated animals. Blocking EV hsa-miR-4488 in vitro and in vivo reactivates NF-jB and blunts the beneficial effects of
EVs.

Conclusions
Extracellular vesicle treatment improved cardiac function, reduced cardiac inflammation, and suppressed arrhythmogenesis in ACM. Further studies are needed prior to translating the present findings to human forms of this
heterogenous disease.

Introduction
Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM) is an inherited heart disease
affecting 1 in 2500 individuals.1 Defects in genes encoding desmosome proteins or their binding partners lead to malfunction of intercellular junctions in cardiac muscle, which normally absorb mechanical
stress and favour membrane stability during cardiac contraction.2-4
Desmosome dysfunction in cardiomyocytes produces membrane
frailty, mitochondrial damage, disrupted cell signalling, and myocardial
injury, which triggers progressive myocyte death, inflammatory activation, and ultimately fibrosis.3 The fibrosis in turn leads to conduction
slowing and re-entry circuits, favouring ventricular arrhythmias (VAs).4
This complex pathophysiology results in heterogeneous clinical manifestations ranging from mild symptoms such as palpitations, to heart failure, and premature death.5
Pathophysiologically based interventions are notably lacking in the
management of ACM patients, which focuses on activity restriction
and generic anti-VA measures such as devices and catheter ablation.4
Inflammation, however, does figure prominently in disease progression.6-8 Patients with ACM have elevated circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines [interleukin (IL)-1b, IL-6, and tumour necrosis

factor-a (TNF-a)],9 and compelling evidence supports the therapeutic
benefits of blunting inflammatory signalling in ACM models.7,10,11
Relevant interventions include inhibition of the complement factor
C5a receptor (CD88),10 blockade of glycogen synthase kinase-3b
(GSK3b), an activator of nuclear factor-jB (NF-jB),11,12 and Bay117082, a small molecule inhibitor of the inflammasome.7 These findings,
while not yet translated to the clinic, collectively suggest that immunomodulation merits further scrutiny as a treatment strategy in ACM.8
In an effort to address ACM more trenchantly, we investigated
small extracellular vesicles (EVs), secreted by cardiosphere-derived
cells (CDCs), as a therapeutic candidate. Cardiosphere-derived cells
are stromal/progenitor cells with anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, anti-fibrotic, and cardiomyogenic properties mediated by EV secretion.13 Although primary CDCs look generally promising in
clinical trials for heart failure, Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD),
and pulmonary hypertension,13 variable potency has been a concern.
We have recently shown that immortalized CDCs expressing high
levels of b-catenin are therapeutically potent, and EVs from these
CDCs consistently recapitulate the effects of CDCs in models of ischaemic injury.14 Here, we tested the hypothesis that EVs are salutary
in Dsg2 mutant (Dsg2mt/mt) mice with ACM. Treatment with EVs

Potent CDC-derived EVs modulate ACM progression

(ECG) and echocardiogram were recorded prior to treatment with EVs
or placebo. Extracellular vesicles (2.0  109) were suspended in 50 lL of
Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium (IMDM) and administered weekly
via retro-orbital injections (to achieve intravenous delivery) in Dsg2mt/mt
mice for four consecutive weeks. Vehicle-treated Dsg2mt/mt mice
received an equal volume of IMDM weekly in the same manner for 4
weeks. Mice were reassessed for ECG, echocardiogram, and programmed electrical stimulation 4 weeks after therapy. Hearts were harvested for optical mapping experiments, and tissue was processed for
histology and immunohistochemistry.

Echocardiographic parameters were measured according to the
American Society of Echocardiography guidelines.15 Mice underwent
two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography at baseline (prior to
treatment) and endpoint (after 4-week treatment). For details see
Supplementary material online.

Electrocardiography
Electrocardiogram was recorded for 1 min during echocardiography with
dual bio-amps (AD Instruments). Intervals (PR, QRS, QT, and RR) were
measured and analysed using LabChart 7 software (AD Instruments) by a
blinded trained observer. QTc interval was calculated as QT interval (ms)
divided by the square root of the RR interval (ms) divided by 100.16 The
maximum slope-intercept method was used to define the end of the T
wave.

Programmed electrical stimulation
Mice were anaesthetized with isoflurane inhalation with 2% isoflurane
and core body temperature was kept at 36 C-38 C (rectal) with a heating lamp. Electrocardiogram was monitored during the procedure. A 1.1F
octapolar electrophysiology catheter (Millar, EPR-800) was inserted via a
jugular vein and advanced into the right atrium and ventricle. For details
see Supplementary material online.

Statistical analysis
All results are expressed as the mean +/- SD. Specific numbers and
descriptions of statistical analyses are included in the legends for each figure and table. All statistical analyses were analysed with GraphPad Prism
8 Software. A P-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Differences in measured variables were assessed with a two-tailed unpaired Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney test (if assumed non-Gaussian
distribution). When comparing more than two groups, one-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey's post hoc analysis to correct for multiple comparisons was applied. For comparisons of ventricular tachycardia (VT) inducibility, v2 test was used.

Results
Extracellular vesicles mitigate left and
right ventricular dysfunction in
arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy
Based on the early increase of mortality in both sexes
(Supplementary material online, Figure S2A) and the results of a pilot
study (Supplementary material online, Figure S2C-K), treatment was
initiated at 4 weeks of age and continued for 4 weeks (see Figure 1A
for experimental overview). Relative to WT mice at baseline,
Dsg2mt/mt mice display impaired left ventricular function (EF,

69.6 +/- 7.7% vs. 81.1 +/- 1.6%; P = 0.0001) and right ventricular dilatation (RVA/TL, 2.6 +/- 0.9 vs. 1.0 +/- 0.4; P = 0.0001) (Figure 1B-G).
Follow-up echocardiography after 4 weeks of treatment revealed
progressively worsening left (P = 0.0002) and right ventricular function (P = 0.0063) (Figure 1B-D) and chamber remodelling [left ventricle (LV), P = 0.0012; right ventricle (RV), P < 0.0001] (Figure 1E-G)
in vehicle-injected Dsg2mt/mt mice. In contrast, those changes were
prevented in EV-treated Dsg2mt/mt mice (Figure 1B-G, Supplementary
material online, Table S1). Overall, EV-treated Dsg2mt/mt mice exhibited better biventricular function (LV, 72.2 +/- 3.9% vs. 57.4 +/- 8.0%;
P < 0.0001; RV, 0.4 +/- 0.1 vs. 0.3 +/- 0.1; P = 0.0037) and less left ventricular dilatation (1.7 +/- 0.1 vs. 1.9 +/- 0.2; P = 0.0179) compared with
controls. Although the right ventricular area was not statistically different in the EV and vehicle groups, echo images from vehicle mice
showed numerous hyperechoic calcified lesions in the interventricular septum and right ventricular free wall; such lesions were infrequent after EV treatment (e.g., Figure 1H). In another Dsg2mt/mt
cohort (Supplementary material online, Figure S3A-H), long-term EV
treatment (for 8 weeks) prevented abnormal ventricular remodelling
throughout the study. Interestingly, the cardiac protective effects persisted at least 4 weeks after EV therapy was completed.

Extracellular vesicles modify
electrocardiographic abnormalities in
arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy
Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy is characterized by a high incidence
of VAs, which can be fatal.17 To investigate the effects of EVs on arrhythmic substrates, we examined ECG parameters at baseline and
at study endpoint (Figure 2A). QTc interval was prolonged after vehicle injection (baseline vs. endpoint, 29.87 +/- 6.2 ms vs.
37.97 +/- 8.6 ms; P = 0.0104), but not in Dsg2mt/mt mice receiving EVs
(P = 0.9306) (Figure 2A and D). At endpoint, vehicle-injected mice also
displayed increased QRS and QTc intervals as compared with WT
and EV-treated Dsg2mt/mt mice (Figure 2B-D). Additional ECG parameters, including heart rate and PR interval, were similar in the EV and
vehicle groups (Supplementary material online, Table S2 and Figure
S4A-C).

Extracellular vesicles diminish
arrhythmias in arrhythmogenic
cardiomyopathy
The normalization of QRS and QTc by EVs indicates benefits on depolarization/conduction and repolarization, respectively, in Dsg2mt/mt
mice, which may attenuate arrhythmogenesis. To characterize the
burden and severity of VAs without impact from sedation, we used
implanted ECG telemetry for ambulatory 24-h monitoring. Vehicle
mice exhibited higher VA burden relative to EV mice (Figure 2F); indeed, the mean VA count was nine-fold higher in the vehicle group
(71.1 +/- 138.3/day vs. 8 +/- 18.2/day; P = 0.0042) (Figure 2G).
Representative ECG records in the vehicle group showed episodes
of spontaneous VT (Figure 2E), while other events such as bigeminy,
couplets, and isolated premature ventricular contractions (PVCs)
were also seen. Importantly, other than isolated PVCs, no arrhythmias were observed in the EV group (Figure 2E and H).
To correlate provocative testing with the telemetry findings, we
performed in vivo programmed electrical stimulation (PES) at study

treated with EVs showed a trend, but not a significant decrease in
VERP (38.9 +/- 15.4 ms vs. 48.1 +/- 11.3 ms; P = 0.1724) (Figure 2K).
Consistently, the norepinephrine challenge test induced fewer PVCs
in EV-treated mice compared with vehicle-injected controls
(Supplementary material online, Figure S4G-J). Taken together, these
observations indicate that EVs modify cardiac electrical remodelling
in ACM, so as to suppress ventricular arrhythmic events.

To better elucidate the mechanism(s) of VAs in ACM, we performed
ex vivo optical mapping with a specific focus on how VTs are initiated
in Dsg2mt/mt mice. Figure 3A shows optical action potentials under
sinus rhythm with frequent ventricular early afterdepolarizations
(EADs) preceding a spontaneous episode of VT in a Dsg2mt/mt heart.
Isochronal activation maps revealed PVCs and VT originating from
the same focal area (Figure 3A). Ventricular tachycardia could also
be induced by PES at the apex (Figure 3B): isochronal activation
maps show sinus ventricular activation with a region of conduction block (dotted line) that created dual-pathway physiology
(white arrows in Figure 3B2). Subsequent electrical stimulation
resulted in differences in conduction velocity and refractoriness
between the two pathways (white arrows in Figure 3B3-4), which
facilitated the VT re-entry circuit (white arrow in Figure 3B5).
Thus, abnormal repolarization and conduction both contribute to
arrhythmogenesis in this model: frequent EADs initiate focal VTs,
while re-entrant VTs result from spatially distinct conduction
velocities and refractoriness.
We next investigated the effects of EVs on the arrhythmogenic
substrate in ACM. Ventricular APD and conduction velocity were
measured using high-resolution optical mapping. Figure 3C and E
shows that EVs significantly mitigated conduction slowing compared
with vehicle (43.5 +/- 6.2 cm/s vs. 53.1 +/- 6.1 cm/s; P = 0.0274).
Moreover, averaged APD80 (APD at 80% repolarization) was shortened (66.8 +/- 7.9 ms vs. 85.4 +/- 12.7 ms; P = 0.0290) (Figure 3D and
F-H), and APD dispersion (7.1 +/- 2.0 ms vs. 11.6 +/- 4.0 ms; P = 0.0291)
(measured as the standard deviation of APD80) was decreased, in EVcompared with vehicle-injected mice (Figure 3I). The rise time of the
optical action potential (a surrogate of sodium channel activity) was
similar among experimental groups (3.6 +/- 0.3 ms vs. 4.2 +/- 0.7 ms vs.
4.0 +/- 0.3 ms, P = 0.1019) (Supplementary material online, Figure S4K).
In summary, optical mapping showed restoration of ventricular heterogeneity, both in terms of CV and APD, underlying the benefits of
EVs on VAs in ACM.
Connexin 43 (Cx43) is the main gap junction type in the ventricular myocardium. Adverse remodelling of Cx43 is a feature of ACM,
and explains, in part, impaired electrical conduction in this condition.18 Accordingly, immunostaining revealed a significant downregulation and redistribution of CX43 in the vehicle group, that was
attenuated by EV treatment (92.1 +/- 7.1% vs. 60.2 +/- 22.3%;
P < 0.0001) (Figure 3J and K). Extracellular vesicles also maintained
plakoglobin expression at cell-cell junctions (Supplementary material
online, Figure S5), indicating a relatively preserved intercalated disc
structure.

Extracellular vesicles ameliorate
underlying cardiac fibrosis in
arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy
Cardiac fibrous replacement, triggered by excessive myocyte death
and inflammation, is a hallmark of ACM partially responsible for
impaired electrical impulse propagation, and increased vulnerability
for re-entrant arrhythmias. Hence, we investigated the effects of EVs
on myocardial fibrosis. By gross pathology, WT and Dsg2mt/mt mice
exhibited no whitish plaques at baseline, corresponding to minimal fibrosis by Masson trichrome staining (Figure 4A, C, and D). Compared
with baseline histology, fibrosis increased significantly in 4-week
vehicle-injected mice and was partially prevented by EV therapy
(Figure 4A, C, and D, and Supplementary material online, Figure S6).
The progression of fibrosis in each group was further confirmed by
quantifying hydroxyproline content in each experimental group
(Figure 4E). Taken together, these findings identify reduction in fibrosis as a contributor to improved cardiac function, and decreased
arrhythmogenesis, in ACM after EV therapy. Moreover, the diminution of fibrosis in EV-treated Dsg2mt/mt mice is likely due to a reduction of fibrosis progression.

Extracellular vesicles attenuate cell
death in arrhythmogenic
cardiomyopathy
To study mechanisms underlying the reduction of fibrosis, we analysed cell death by immunostaining of cleaved caspase 3 (for apoptosis) and IgG (for necrosis) and quantified levels of serum troponin I
(for necrosis). As shown in Figure 4B and F, at baseline, few apoptotic
nuclei were seen in WT or Dsg2mt/mt mouse hearts. At the study
endpoint, higher myocyte apoptosis was observed in vehicle-injected
Dsg2mt/mt hearts compared with those in WT and EV-treated groups.
Serum troponin I levels were low regardless of genotype or intervention at both baseline and endpoint, suggesting the necrotic process
was insidious with periodic acute bursts (Figure 4G). Tissue immunostaining of cytoplasmic IgG revealed significant cell necrosis in Dsg2mt/
mt
hearts observed only at the endpoint (not baseline); EV treatment
significantly reduced myonecrosis (Figure 4H and I). Together, these
findings suggest cardiac fibrosis aligns with cell death.

Inflammation and extracellular vesicle
therapy in arrhythmogenic
cardiomyopathy
Inflammation has been recognized as a modifiable factor in the pathophysiology of ACM, influencing ventricular function, arrhythmias, and
fibrosis.6,7,10 Taking into consideration that EVs reduced cell death,
we hypothesized a potential immunomodulatory response by EVs.
To probe the effects of EVs on inflammation, we performed RNA
sequencing (RNA-seq) in the three experimental groups. Relative to
WT, heat maps revealed numerous changes of gene expression in
vehicle-injected Dsg2mt/mt mice (Figure 5A and Supplementary material online, Figure S7), changes which were at least partially reverted towards WT levels by EV treatment (Figure 5A and Supplementary
material online, Figure S7). In total, 5700 disease-altered transcripts

examples). Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) identified many differentially expressed pathways related to inflammation and fibrosis (Figure
5C). The very notable changes in mitochondrial function and oxidative phosphorylation may reflect direct modification of these pathways, or simply changes in volume occupancy by scar (which,
reciprocally, alter volume occupancy by living heart tissue, which is
rich in mitochondria).19 Additional experimentation will be required
to distinguish between these possibilities.

Extracellular vesicles modulate the
immune response in arrhythmogenic
cardiomyopathy
Given the striking transcriptomic changes, we sought protein-level insight into the inflammatory response by quantifying inflammatory
cytokines in the heart (Figure 6A). Compared to WT, vehicle-injected
Dsg2mt/mt mice displayed increased levels of multiple proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1a, IL-1b, IL-2, IL-4, IL-13, TNFa, chemokine ligand-5 (RANTE), neutrophil chemoattractant LIX
(CXCL-5), CXCL-1, B-cell chemoattractant (CXCL-13), monocyte

chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and granulocyte-macrophage
colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF); EV treatment blunted most of
these responses (Figure 6B and C).
Nuclear factor-jB, a master regulator of inflammatory gene expression, was up-regulated in vehicle-injected Dsg2mt/mt hearts
(Figure 6D). Nuclear translocation of phosphorylated NF-jB, which
primes NLRP3 and activates inflammasomes, induces the transcription of IL-1b and other pro-inflammatory factors.20 In vehicleinjected Dsg2mt/mt hearts, activated NF-jB signalling was accompanied by the assembly of inflammasomes (NLRP3, ASC, Casp1-p20;
Figure 6D). Extracellular vesicle treatment attenuated NF-jB phosphorylation and suppressed inflammasome formation (Figure 6D).
Interleukin-1b level increased 10-fold in Dsg2mt/mt mice and was
reduced towards WT levels by EV therapy, albeit non-significantly
(P = 0.0723) (Figure 6D). Along with the changes in pro-inflammatory
cytokines, macrophages in the heart-as gauged either by CD68 tissue levels (Figure 6E) or by immunohistochemistry (Figure 6F,
Supplementary material online, Figure S8F)-followed the same pattern: up with vehicle, down with EVs.

Potent CDC-derived EVs modulate ACM progression

Extracellular vesicles mitigate nuclear
factor-jB activation via miR-4488 transfer to cardiomyocytes
Nuclear factor-jB activation can promote inflammation and myocyte
death, while blocking NF-jB reverses the ACM phenotype.7 To
understand the role of this pathway in the salutary effects of EV therapy, we studied the effects of EVs on NF-jB on Dsg2mt/mt mice. After
EV treatment, immunostaining from Dsg2mt/mt mice showed fewer
cardiomyocytes positive for nuclear NF-jB compared with vehicle-

injected or WT animals (Figure 7A and B). Consistently, using an
in vitro neonatal rat ventricular myocyte (NRVM) model of TNF-a
induced NF-jB activation, we showed decreased nuclear translocation of NF-jB after EV administration (Figure 7C-F).
Knowing EVs are associated with less NF-jB activation in vitro and
in vivo, we then studied which EV components are responsible for
these effects. RNA sequencing of both highly potent immortalized
CDC-derived and primary CDC-derived EVs revealed >850 unique
miRNAs in EVs isolated from both cell lines. The 21 most abundant
miRNAs were used for downstream analysis (Figure 7G,

Blocking hsa-miR-4488 blunts the beneficial effects of extracellular vesicles
We further examined whether antagomir-4488 can offset the therapeutic effects of EVs in vivo. Using the same study protocol (Figure
8A), antagomir-4488 was retro-orbitally injected to Dsg2mt/mt mice
prior to each EV therapy. Follow-up echocardiography after 4 weeks
of treatment revealed deterioration of left and right ventricular function (Figure 8B and C) and chamber enlargement (Figure 8D and E) in
Dsg2mt/mt mice receiving combined treatment (antagomir-4488 and
EVs) compared with EV alone. In line with the changes in cardiac
function, Dsg2mt/mt mice treated with both antagomir-4488 and EVs
displayed higher VT inducibility (Figure 8F) and larger extent of cardiac fibrosis compared with WT and animals treated with EVs alone
(Figure 8G and H).

Protein profiling of extracellular vesicles
To further investigate the molecular processes that mediated the
therapeutic effects of EVs, we have defined EV proteomic composition. Comparisons of proteins found in EVs from potent immortalized CDCs with primary CDCs revealed that proteins differentially
expressed or unique to immortalized CDC EVs are chaperone proteins, metabolite interconversion enzymes, and cytoskeletal proteins
(Supplementary material online, Figure S9A-C and F). Gene ontology
analysis of biological processes identified these proteins important in
cell growth and/or maintenance, energy pathways, metabolism, and
signal transduction (Supplementary material online, Figure S9D, E, G,
and H), which could facilitate myocyte recovery after injury22,23.
b-catenin, highly expressed in potent immortalized CDCs, is essential in ACM pathogenesis when it is down-regulated11. Reduction
and redistribution of Cx43 in Dsg2mt/mt mice are known to contribute to arrhythmogenesis24. To study the potential roles of b-catenin
and Cx43 in the effects of EVs, we analysed the protein content from
immortalized CDCs, EVs, and the transfer of these two proteins to
target cells. Immunoblotting showed b-catenin and Cx43 to be quite
low in EVs despite being high in CDCs (Supplementary material online, Figure S10A). Treating NRVMs with EVs did not increase b-

S10B and C). Based on these findings, we conclude the EV contents of
both b-catenin and Cx43 are very low, and EV therapy does not affect their expression in target cells.

Discussion
Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy is increasingly recognized as an inflammatory desmosomopathy accompanied by progressive myocyte
death and fibrofatty infiltration.6,7 The exact molecular mechanisms
underlying this complex disease are not well-understood.
Inflammation is an early and evolving feature of ACM and precedes
any evident pathological feature of the disease.7,25,26 Nevertheless,
whether inflammation serves as the initial trigger or is a secondary response to cell death remains unclear. Regardless, inflammation can
have a deleterious effect on the myocardium. Interventions targeted
at complement receptor CD88,10 and NF-jB,7 ameliorate the disease phenotype in vitro and in vivo. Here, we provide further reason to
implicate hyperinflammation as a major pathogenetic component of
ACM. Repeated administration of EVs modulated the immune response, mitigated intercalated disc remodelling and fibrous infiltration, while improving cardiac function and blunting arrhythmias in
ACM (Graphical abstract). The work here differs from previous studies of targeted therapies in using a cell-free therapeutic candidate
derived from the secretome of stromal cells.
Collectively, these results highlight the critical role of NF-jB activation in ACM pathogenesis. Although the present findings are from
a murine model, several lines of evidence support a role for NF-jB
signalling in human ACM. Namely, induced pluripotent stem cellderived cardiomyocytes from an ACM patient were found to have
enhanced NF-jB signalling compared with healthy controls.27
Moreover, inflammatory infiltration was more commonly seen in
ACM patients who died suddenly.28,29 Meanwhile, clinical interest in
new NF-jB pathway inhibitors is growing.30 Thus, the data are consistent with a role for NF-jB-mediated inflammation in human ACM,
but the potential therapeutic value of NF-jB as a target in human
ACM remains to be tested.
Interestingly, ACM and DMD share many histological and molecular/cellular pathogenic mechanisms.31 Intramyocardial and intravenous injection of primary CDC-derived EVs reverses many features of
DMD by blunting oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, and fibrosis.32,33 Two clinical trials of DMD have used primary CDCs, with promising benefits in both cardiac and skeletal
muscle.34,35 While the parent cells are viable therapeutic candidates,
EVs transcend a number of limitations and disadvantages inherent to
cell therapy. Here, we demonstrated that EVs from potent immortalized CDCs have similar pathophysiological consequences and regress
ACM disease manifestations.
Even more than heart failure, VA is a defining feature of ACM. In
the JUP2157del2 ACM model, mice treated with the GSK-3 inhibitor
(SB216763) exhibited lower PVC burden and shorter QRS duration.11 Inactivation of NF-jB resulted in the elimination of late
potentials in signal-averaged ECGs in Dsg2mt/mt mice.7 However, little is known about the mechanisms whereby salutary interventions
improve VAs and electrical remodelling in ACM. The present study
provides mechanistic insights regarding the underlying causes of

Supplementary material online, Figure S8A-C). Using NRVMs treated
with either EVs or vehicle, co-transfection of antagomirs against the
five most abundant miRNAs was performed. Transfection with
antagomir-4488 increased NF-jB phosphorylation as TNF-a did
(Figure 7H and I). Additionally, immunostaining confirmed that transfection of antagomir-4488 promoted nuclear translocation of NF-jB
(Figure 7J and K). Collectively, these results suggest EVs mitigate NFjB activation, in part, via miR-4488 transfer to cardiomyocytes.
Along with these findings, in vitro NRVM studies showed a significant reduction of TNF-a-induced apoptosis by pre-treatment with
EVs, whereas antagomir-4488 blunted the anti-apoptotic effect of
EVs (Supplementary material online, Figure S8D and E), indicating hsamiR-4488 is important in reducing cell death.
Nuclear factor-jB activation causes cardiomyocyte death, and
blocking hsa-miR-4488 has been reported to increase cell death21.
Taken together, these findings support the hypothesis that the salutary effects of EVs in ACM can be, at least partially, explained by hsamiR-4488 transfer to cardiomyocytes mediating a reduction in myocyte death.

Study limitations
Our study has several limitations. First of all, we have not established an unambiguous causal role for hyperinflammation in ACM
pathogenesis, nor have we documented a correlation with inflammatory activity and disease severity. However, previous studies
showed cytokines were positively correlated with myocardial injury and inversely correlated with cardiac function.7 This suggests
the salutary effects of EVs in ACM might be explained by the antiinflammatory effects of CDC-derived EVs. Lastly, strenuous exercise is known to accelerate ACM progression and to increase arrhythmic risk, and as such, higher mortality rate has been
documented in ACM mice receiving swimming training.37 Future
studies correlating animals' activity and response to EV therapy
would give us important insights into this mechanistically based
ACM therapy.

arrhythmogenesis in ACM. We find that delayed repolarization and
re-entry both contribute to VAs in ACM. Extracellular vesicles
improved spontaneous and induced VAs by accelerating cardiac conduction, and by improving repolarization, with underlying reversal of
Cx43 down-regulation, fibrosis, and inflammation.
Amelioration of the ACM phenotype by immune modulation has
motivated the testing of additional therapeutic candidates, including a
TNF-a inhibitor, pentoxifylline, and a monoclonal antibody against IL1b, Canakinumab.36 Our results raise the possibility that cell-derived
cell-free therapies that modify immune signalling might be another
mechanistically based therapy in ACM. Although Dsg2mt/mt mice recapitulate many of the human features of ACM (arrhythmogenicity
and fibrosis), mouse hearts lack the fatty infiltrations seen in humans.
In addition, these mice display an early and very aggressive phenotype
(e.g. severe cardiomyopathy, QTc prolongation) that does not necessarily fit the broad spectrum of human disease presentation.
Therefore, further pre-clinical and clinical studies are needed prior to
translating the present findings to human forms of this heterogeneous
disease.
