Aims

PCSK9 is secreted into the circulation, mainly by the liver, and interacts with low-density lipoprotein receptor
(LDLR) homologous and non-homologous receptors, including CD36, thus favouring their intracellular degradation.
As PCSK9 deficiency increases the expression of lipids and lipoprotein receptors, thus contributing to cellular lipid
accumulation, we investigated whether this could affect heart metabolism and function.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Wild-type (WT), Pcsk9 KO, Liver conditional Pcsk9 KO and Pcsk9/Ldlr double KO male mice were fed for 20 weeks
Methods
with a standard fat diet and then exercise resistance, muscle strength, and heart characteristics were evaluated.
and results

Pcsk9 KO presented reduced running resistance coupled to echocardiographic abnormalities suggestive of heart
failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Heart mitochondrial activity, following maximal coupled and
uncoupled respiration, was reduced in Pcsk9 KO mice compared to WT mice and was coupled to major changes
in cardiac metabolism together with increased expression of LDLR and CD36 and with lipid accumulation. A similar
phenotype was observed in Pcsk9/Ldlr DKO, thus excluding a contribution for LDLR to cardiac impairment
observed in Pcsk9 KO mice. Heart function profiling of the liver selective Pcsk9 KO model further excluded the involvement of circulating PCSK9 in the development of HFpEF, pointing to a possible role locally produced PCSK9.
Concordantly, carriers of the R46L loss-of-function variant for PCSK9 presented increased left ventricular mass but
similar ejection fraction compared to matched control subjects.

Conclusion
PCSK9 deficiency impacts cardiac lipid metabolism in an LDLR independent manner and contributes to the development of HFpEF.

Translational perspective
PCSK9 inhibitors target circulating PCSK9, increase hepatic LDL receptor expression, and reduce LDL-cholesterol levels and ischaemic
heart disease. On the contrary, genetic PCSK9 deficiency results in increased risk of developing diabetes or ectopic fat accumulation.
Here, we extend this line of evidence showing that systemic PCSK9 deficiency results in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, a
finding independent of the modulation of LDL receptor and of circulating PCSK9. This observation supports the safety profile emerged
so far with therapies targeting PCSK9, which are directed towards liver-derived circulating PCSK9.

Introduction
The heart largely uses aerobic metabolism for its energetic needs
with the majority of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) being produced
following fatty acid (FA) oxidation.1
Unlike the liver, the heart is not able to synthesize high amounts of
FAs and, therefore, FA demand is primarily supported by the uptake
from the circulation, where FAs are transported either as free FAs
bound to albumin or as triglycerides in lipoproteins.2 FAs are then
dissociated from albumin or released from lipoproteins through the
activity of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), and delivered to cardiomyocytes
through FA transport proteins or FA translocases such as CD36.
Lipoproteins deliver FAs, and cholesterol to cardiomyocytes by

interacting with specific receptors on cell surface including the very
low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR).3,4
Cardiac lipid demand is a finely tuned process that balances lipid
uptake and mitochondrial beta-oxidation to support cardiac metabolism with the need to prevent excessive lipid accumulation which
on the contrary induces cardiomyocyte dysfunction.5 In patients with
heart failure, cardiomyocytes switch to glycolysis as preferred pathway for ATP generation, thus promoting cellular triacylglycerol
(TAG) accumulation.6 Lactate, ketone bodies, or amino acids7 are
used as source of energy alternative to FAs7 in subjects with metabolic syndrome and diabetes.8 At the molecular level, on one hand TAG
accumulation and FA overload promote mitochondrial dysfunction
and oxidative phosphorylation uncoupling in cardiomyocytes while

Impact of Pcsk9 deficiency on cardiac function and mitochondrial metabolism. Pcsk9 deficiency is associated with increased heart left ventricular thickness
and reduced running performance independently of skeletal muscle alterations. Electron microscopy analysis showed increased cardiac accumulation of
lipid droplets associated with a reduced density of mitochondrial cristae; this proffunctionally translated into impaired oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial metabolism in PCSK9 KO hearts.

Results
Pcsk9 deficiency is associated with heart
failure with preserved ejection fraction
To investigate whether the impact of PCSK9 on systemic and cellular
lipid and lipoprotein metabolism might affect cardiac function, we
evaluated heart morphology in Pcsk9 KO and wild-type (WT) male
mice fed for 20 weeks with standard fat diet. Electrocardiographic
analysis (Figure 1A) of the heart of Pcsk9 KO mice showed an
increased thickness of the left ventricular posterior wall (LVPW) during both systole and diastole as compared to WT mice (Figure 1B and
C) despite no difference in total body weight between the two groups
(Supplementary material online, Figure S1A). This was coupled with
an increased relative wall thickness (Figure 1D) in spite of similar left
ventricular mass normalized on body weight ratio (Figure 1E) and
ejection fraction (Figure 1F) in Pcsk9 KO compared to WT mice, thus
suggesting a concentric remodelling of the heart. To evaluate
whether this profile associates with impaired cardiac functionality, exercise intolerance and running resistance in fatigue test were performed in WT and Pcsk9 KO mice. The latter experienced a
significant reduction of the running distance and the running time
observed in the exhaustion test compared to WT mice (Figure 1G
and H).
Of note, this phenotype was not the consequence of a reduced
skeletal muscle performance as similar results were observed in the
forelimb grip test (Figure 1I) coupled with no differences in oxygen
consumption rate in soleus muscle between Pcsk9 KO and WT mice
(Supplementary material online, Figure S1B). These data indicate that
Pcsk9 KO mice present a profile suggestive of HFpEF.

Cardiac mitochondrial metabolism is
altered in Pcsk9-deficient mice
Given the key role of PCSK9 in cellular lipid biology, we next evaluated the impact of PCSK9 deficiency on cardiac lipid metabolism
and its relevance for heart energetic demand. Freshly isolated hearts
from Pcsk9 KO mice exhibited a significant reduction in oxygen consumption rate compared to control mice under maximal coupled
and uncoupled respiration (Figure 2A). This finding, coupled with the
reduced activity of the complex II of the electron transport chain
(ETC) observed in Pcsk9 KO mice (Supplementary material online,
Figure S2A and B), prompted us to test whether ATP production was
affected. ATP levels (Figure 2B) and ATP energy charge (Figure 2C)
were reduced in the heart of Pcsk9 KO mice compared to WT littermates together with other cofactors involved in energy production
(Supplementary material online, Figure S2D-K). Moreover, a detailed
proteomic analysis of cardiac tissue showed that the expression of
several mitochondrial proteins was affected in Pcsk9 KO heart compared to WT (Supplementary material online, Figure S2A), including
those of key structural components of ETC complexes (Figure 2D).
This finding was further confirmed by western blot analysis of

on the other hand contribute to the production of lipotoxic species
including diacylglycerol, long-chain acyl-CoA, acylcarnitines and lysophospholipids, which contribute to heart failure.5
Several experimental observations have provided a connection between lipid accumulation and cardiac dysfunction. Mice lacking adipose triglyceride lipase present a marked cardiac accumulation of
TAG paralleled by heart failure and premature death.9 Similarly, the
overexpression of both peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor
alpha (PPARa) and gamma (PPARc) increases FA oxidation but
causes an imbalance in cardiac lipid metabolism as a consequence of
FA uptake exceeding oxidation, thus leading to lipid accumulation.10
On the same line, mice expressing glycosylphosphatidylinositol
(GPI)-anchored human LPL (aMHC-LpLGPI) selectively in cardiomyocytes have increased cardiac uptake and accumulation of lipids
that are derived from circulating lipoproteins including triglycerides,
FAs, and cholesterol.11
All together these data are consistent with the concept that promoting the activity of pathways involved in lipid uptake might contribute to cardiac lipid overload and toxicity and suggest that factors
increasing lipoprotein receptor expression in the heart might result
in cardiac dysfunction as was shown also for hypoxia inducing
VLDLR-mediated cardiac lipotoxicity.12
Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), a 692amino acid glycoprotein, is known to control low-density lipoprotein
receptor (LDLR) recycling.13,14 In addition to LDLR, PCSK9 targets
LDLR homologous and non-homologous receptors, including
VLDLR,15 ApoER2 (LRP8),16 LRP1,17 and CD36,18 and, disrupts their
recycling by inhibiting the dissociation from the lipoprotein in the
endosome-lysosome compartment, thus promoting their degradation. As such, increased PCSK9 levels result in reduced recycling of
these receptors, a finding extensively described in the liver. PCSK9,
however, exerts extra-hepatic effects19; its deficiency is associated
with impaired pancreatic beta-cell function20 and increased risk of
developing diabetes in humans.20-22 Of note Pcsk9 KO mice present
increased body weight and visceral adipose tissue deposition, a finding confirmed in carriers of a PCSK9 loss-of-function variant.23 The
observation that these subjects also present increased epicardial adipose tissue,23 coupled to the key role of PCSK9 in controlling key
receptors involved in cardiac lipoprotein uptake provides the rationale for investigating whether PCSK9 deficiency impacts cardiac lipid
metabolism and function. To this end, we tested the impact of
PCSK9 deficiency on heart metabolism and function in an experimental setting where insulin response is preserved. Pcsk9 KO mice were
indeed fed standard fat diet for 20 weeks and we observed that
PCSK9 deficiency affected lipid metabolism and energy production in
the heart that lead to the thickening of the left ventricular wall and
the development of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction
(HFpEF). To further investigate the impact of this observation in the
clinical setting, cardiac function was investigated in subjects carrying a
loss-of-function polymorphism of PCSK9.

PCSK9 deficiency and cardiac function

PCSK9 deficiency results in increased
LDLR and CD36 expression in the heart
coupled with lipid accumulation
To get further insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the
dysfunctional cardiac phenotype, we investigated the expression of
key PCSK9 targets in the heart. Both the expressions of LDLR and
CD36 were increased in Pcsk9 KO mice compared to WT littermates (Figure 4A and B). Of note, transmission electron microscopy
analysis of the hearts showed longitudinally oriented myofibrils and
regular intercalated discs in both WT and Pcsk9 KO mice (Figure 4C
and D). Pcsk9 KO hearts, however, presented abundant lipid droplets
tightly associated with mitochondria (Figure 4D), a characteristic barely appreciated in WT mice (Figure 4C). This observation further supports the presence of lipid accumulation in the heart of Pcsk9 KO
mice. The quantitative analysis of ultrathin sections showed that
Pcsk9 KO mice presented a statistically significant increase in the
number of lipid droplets (Figure 4E and Supplementary material

online, Figure S4A) as well as of lipid droplets diameter (Figure 4F).
Moreover, increased total cholesterol (Figure 4G) and arachidonic
acid levels (Supplementary material online, Figure S4B) but similar
total triglyceride content (Figure 4H) were observed in the heart of
Pcsk9 KO mice compared to WT littermates. As expected, plasma
cholesterol and triglyceride levels were lower in Pcsk9 KO mice compared to WT20 (Supplementary material online, Figure S3G and H).
The observation of increased lipid droplets number and cholesterol content, coupled with increased LDLR receptor expression in
the heart of Pcsk9 KO mice, points to a possible role of LDLR in promoting the increased cardiac lipid accumulation. To test this hypothesis, we characterized heart function, morphology, and metabolism in
mice lacking both PCSK9 and LDLR (DKO).
DKO mice presented a significant reduction compared to Ldlr KO
mice in the distance and the time of running observed in the exhaustion test (Figure 5A and B); this effect was not dependent on differences in skeletal muscle strength, as the results from the forelimb grip
test were similar (Figure 5C). Notably heart left ventricular mass/
weight and heart LVPW thickness in systole were significantly lower
in Ldlr KO mice compared to WT (left ventricular mass/weight: WT
5.31 +/- 0.98 vs. Ldlr KO 4.10 +/- 0.91, P = 0.04) (LVPW: WT 1.23 +/- 0.13
vs. Ldlr KO 1.10 +/- 0.08, P = 0.04) (Supplementary material online,
Table S1), a finding that fits with their reduced performance on running endurance compared to WT (running distance: WT
331.1 +/- 46.20 vs. Ldlr KO 245.3 +/- 40.93 m, P = 0.049) (Supplementary
material online, Figure S5A-C). On the other hand, the echocardiographic profile of DKO was very similar to that observed in Pcsk9 KO
mice (Figures 1B and 5C), suggesting that the impact of PCSK9 on
heart function does not depend on the modulation of LDLR expression and on changes in plasma cholesterol levels (Supplementary material online, Figure S5D and E). Indeed, echocardiographic analysis
showed that DKO mice presented a significant left ventricular thickening during systole (Figure 5D) without alterations in ejection fraction (Figure 5E) compared to Ldlr KO mice. In addition, metabolic
analysis showed that ATP levels and energy charge were still significantly reduced in DKO mice as compared to Ldlr KO mice (Figure 5F
and G). This profile is consistent with a reduced flux of TCA cycle
coupled with mitochondrial dysfunction (Figure 5H) in the heart, and
with increased plasma levels of lactate (Figure 5I and Supplementary
material online, Figure S5F). These data strongly support the concept
that the increased cardiac LDLR expression induced by PCSK9 deficiency is not involved in the phenotype observed. To get further
insights into the connection between PCSK9 and cardiomyocytes
physiology, we performed a series of studies in cardiomyocytes differentiated from human pluripotent stem cells (iPSC-CMs). The acquisition of cardiomyocyte phenotype was documented by the
increase, up to 300 folds, of troponin T expression (Supplementary
material online, Figure S6A). VLDL supplementation leads to a significant increase in the expression of LDLR, CD36, LPL, glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4), and FA synthase mRNA expression in iPSCCMs compared to cells grown in control medium (Supplementary
material online, Figure S6B). Moreover, VLDL treatment resulted in
decreased mitochondrial mass (Supplementary material online, Figure
S6C) and increased accumulation of neutral lipids (Supplementary
material online, Figure S6D). These effects were reverted when cardiomyocytes were pre-treated with PCSK9 (Supplementary material
online, Figure S6E and F) confirming a role for PCSK9 in regulating

proteins representative of each mitochondrial complex, including
NADH ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B8 (Ndufb8-Complex
I), succinate dehydrogenase complex subunit B (Sdhb-Complex II),
and ubiquinol-cytochrome C reductase core protein 2 (Uqcrc2-
Complex III) that were significantly reduced in the heart of Pcsk9 KO
mice (Figure 2E and F) compared to WT littermates. This finding together with the reduction of complex II activity (Supplementary material online, Figure S2B) supports the possibility that FADH2 could
undergo a less efficient entry of into the ETC, a process that could
impact FA catabolism. In parallel with these findings, also mitochondrial DNA copy number was reduced (Supplementary material online, Figure S2C), suggesting that mitochondrial function and content
are affected in the heart of Pcsk9 KO mice.
We next asked whether this translates into altered cardiac metabolism. The combied analysis of metabolomic, proteomic, and lipidomic profiles in the heart of Pcsk9 KO and of WT mice (Figure 3A and
Supplementary material online, Figure S3) revealed that impaired
mitochondrial activity results from: (i) impaired FA oxidation as supported by the increase of acyl-carnitines carrying medium-chain FA
(C8 and C10) coupled to the reduction of b-oxidation enzymes, such
as sterol carrier protein 2 (SCP2), enoyl-CoA hydratase, and short
chain 1 (ECHS1) (Figure 3A and Supplementary material online, Figure
S3C and D), and (ii) decreased tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle flux
(Figure 3A and Supplementary material online, Figure S3A and E) as
indicated by the reduced levels of TCA intermediates and enzymes
catalyzing key enzymatic reactions. The reduced levels of glucose-6P
(Figure 3A and Supplementary material online, Figure S3B and F) and
the increased levels of lactate dehydrogenase coupled with increased
lactate plasma levels (Figure 3A) further confirmed a switch to anaerobic metabolism, which, however, is not sufficient to support heart
energy demand and indeed a net reduction in energy charge is
observed in the heart of Pcsk9 KO mice compared to WT (Figure
2C). Concordantly, functional pathway analysis of cardiac proteome
showed increased cardiac dysfunction related to the inability of sustaining cellular energy demand (Figure 3B) and the electron microscopy analysis of mitochondria from both WT and Pcsk9 KO hearts
showed less dense and organized mitochondrial cristae in cardiomyocytes from Pcsk9 KO heart compared to WT (Figure 3C).

to WT and the same was true for primary cardiomyocytes isolated
Pcsk9/Ldlr DKO (Supplementary material online, Figure S6G), thus further excluding a role for the LDLR in the phenotype observed.

Circulating PCSK9 does not impact
heart metabolism

Genetic PCSK9 loss of function is
associated with altered cardiac
phenotype in humans
To further translate our findings in humans, we evaluated the impact
of a PCSK9 loss-of-function variant (R46L) on echocardiographicbased markers of cardiac functionality in a cohort of 2606 subjects
from the general population (PLIC study). A pilot analysis of cardiac
profile in 12 heterozygous R46L carriers (Supplementary material
online, Table S2) showed that these subjects displayed significant increase in left ventricular mass index (Figure 7A) but similar ejection
fraction (Figure 7B) compared to age- and sex-matched WT subjects.
Interestingly, leg and arm skeletal muscle mass were comparable between heterozygous subjects and WT carriers (Figure 7C).

Discussion
In this work, we demonstrate that PCSK9 plays a key role in controlling heart metabolism and function. When PCSK9 is absent, the expression of key receptors involved in lipid and lipoprotein uptake is
increased and results in heart cholesterol accumulation, impaired
beta-oxidation and mitochondrial activity, thus affecting cardiac metabolism and function (Graphical abstract).

Unlike the liver, the heart cannot synthesize large amounts of FAs
and therefore lipid demand is primarily fulfilled with the uptake from
the circulation, which however needs to be properly controlled to
limit an excessive uptake which may result in lipid accumulation and
cellular lipotoxicity. Under these circumstances, cardiomyocytes
switch their metabolism towards anaerobic glycolysis, which however does not fully compensate the elevated energetic demand.
Physiologically, this shift triggers a series of morphological adaptations
in the heart including increased left ventricular wall thickness to maintain ejection fraction. This profile is typical of HFpEF where cardiomyocytes switch their metabolism from FA oxidation into
mitochondria, to glycolysis and ketone body utilization24 as described
in patients with hypertension25 and obesity,26 as well as with
diabetes.27
Here we show that a similar profile is observed in PCSK9-deficient
conditions in experimental models. A detailed profiling of cardiac
metabolic signature revealed that oxygen consumption rate and ATP
levels are reduced as a consequence of impaired mitochondrial function as suggested also by the changes in ETC protein complexes and
activity. Previous observations highlighted that heart lipid accumulation drives lipotoxicity and contributes to heart metabolic switch;
thus, the observation that PCSK9 deficiency results in increased cholesterol accumulation in the heart coupled with metabolic shift towards anaerobic glycolysis supports the hypothesis that PCSK9 plays
a physiologically role in maintaining a proper balance of factors
involved in lipid uptake by cardiomyocytes.
The obvious candidates for this activity are lipoprotein receptors,
which, although expressed at a lower extent in the heart compared
to other tissues, such as the liver, still play a critical role in controlling
heart lipoprotein uptake and lipid metabolism.28 The observation
that the expression of both LDLR and CD36 two PCSK9 targets, is
increased in the heart of Pcsk9 KO mice could represent a matter of
concern for patients treated with PCSK9 inhibitors, as the increase in
LDLR recycling is responsible for increased lipoproteins uptake in
liver and plasma cholesterol lowering, but might also influence heart
lipid accumulation. To further elucidate this aspect, cardiac profile
and running endurance were investigated in Pcsk9/Ldlr DKO mice and
in Ldlr KO mice. Of note Pcsk9/Ldlr DKO mice still present heart dysfunction and the metabolic sequalae observed in Pcsk9 KO mice,
while Ldlr KO had a significantly lower left ventricular mass/weight
and heart LVPW thickness in systole compared to WT, thus excluding a role for PCSK9/LDLR axis in the cardiac phenotype observed.
Moreover, this finding suggests that eventually LDLR-mediated lipoprotein uptake, at least in the heart, does not result in lipid accumulation and cardiac metabolism impairment. Could pharmacological
inhibition of PCSK9 result in increased cardiac lipid uptake and heart
dysfunction? Data from large interventional trials with PCSK9 inhibitors did not report an increased incidence of heart failure.29
Current therapies targeting PCSK9 include monoclonal antibodies
which act by sequestering circulating PCSK9,30 and a gene silencing
approach, which acts by selectively silencing PCSK9 mRNA expression in the liver.31 Given that the liver contributes to circulating
PCSK9 levels, both approaches reduce circulating PCSK9 but do not
affect local PCSK9 production, except for the liver. To explore
whether a complete lack of circulating PCSK9 could impact heart metabolism, cardiac function was evaluated in an experimental model
lacking PCSK9 expression selectively in the liver, thus presenting

In both human and mice, circulating PCSK9 is largely contributed by
the liver. Therefore, to separate the effect of circulating vs. locally
produced PCSK9 on heart function, we profiled cardiac function and
heart morphology in mice lacking PCSK9 production selectively in
the liver (AlbCreth/Pcsk9LoxP/LoxP mice) and therefore deficient for
PCSK9 only in the circulation.20 The running distance and the running
time observed in the exhaustion test were similar in AlbCreth/
Pcsk9LoxP/LoxP mice compared to their AlbCre/Pcsk9LoxP/LoxP counterpart (Figure 6A and B) as was muscular performance (Figure 6C).
Accordingly, no differences emerged for left ventricular thickness
during systole (Figure 6D), for ejection fraction (Figure 6E) as well as
for several cardiac parameters (Supplementary material online, Figure
S7A-E). Also, ATP production (Figure 6F), ATP energy charge (Figure
6G), Krebs cycle metabolites (Figure 6H), and glycolysis intermediates
(Supplementary material online, Figure S7F) were not different in the
heart of these mice. Circulating lactate levels (Figure 6J) and triglycerides (Supplementary material online, Figure S7G) were not affected in
AlbCreth/Pcsk9LoxP/LoxP mice compared to their AlbCre/Pcsk9LoxP/LoxP
counterpart while cholesterol was significantly reduced in liver selective KO (Supplementary material online, Figure S7H). These data
excluded a role for the deficiency of liver-produced (i.e. circulating)
PCSK9 in the phenotype observed, rather pointing to locally produced PCSK9 deficiency as a driver of heart dysfunction.

undetectable circulating PCSK9 levels but unaltered expression in
other tissues20; a phenotype which mimics that observed following
PCSK9 inhibitors therapy. In this experimental model, exercise performance, heart morphology, metabolic signature, and oxygen consumption were similar to those of WT mice. This observation is
seminal to exclude any possible impact of circulating PCSK9 deficiency on heart metabolism and is in line with the data on cardiac
function observed in clinical trials with anti-PCSK9 therapies.
Which cells are then providing PCSK9 that is critical for the maintaineance of cardiomyocyte homeostasis and lipid balance?
Under basal conditions, PCSK9 is expressed at very low levels in
the heart (Supplementary material online, Figure S7I) but is induced
in vivo under ischaemic conditions32 and in vitro following incubation
with oxidized LDL.33 It has been hypothesized that PCSK9 induction
immediately after ischemia/reperfusion injury might protect the heart
in the acute phase by stimulating autophagic process and the removals of damaged mitochondria,32 an effect that could became deleterious over time as might lead to increased cell deterioration and
cardiomyocyte death. It is also possible that PCSK9 produced locally
by epicardial adipose tissue34 contributes to this pathophysiological
change, a finding supported by the observation that the R46L variant
is associated with increased epicardial fat accumulation in humans,23
independently of obesity or diabetes. However, we did not find any
correlation between epicardial fat thickness and left ventricular mass
(data not shown), supporting the hypothesis of an effect of PCSK9 on
epicardial adipose tissue inflammation largely related to heart failure
with reduced ejection fraction.35 Future studies in larger cohorts
should address whether PCSK9 loss-of-function variants are associated with an altered cardiac phenotype independently of the lower
cardiovascular risk provided by the long-life reduction in LDLcholesterol levels observed under these circumstances. We have to
acknowledge that we profiled heart function in full Pcsk9 KO mice
and in liver selective PCSK9 KO models. While our findings excluded
