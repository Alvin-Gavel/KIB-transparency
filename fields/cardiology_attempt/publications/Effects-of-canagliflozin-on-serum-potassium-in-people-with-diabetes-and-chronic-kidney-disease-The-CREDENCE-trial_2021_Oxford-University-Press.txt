Aims

Hyperkalaemia is a common complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and limits the optimal use of agents
that block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, particularly in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). In
patients with CKD, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors provide cardiorenal protection, but
whether they affect the risk of hyperkalaemia remains uncertain.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
The CREDENCE trial randomized 4401 participants with T2DM and CKD to the SGLT2 inhibitor canagliflozin or
matching placebo. In this post hoc analysis using an intention-to-treat approach, we assessed the effect of canaglifloand results
zin on a composite outcome of time to either investigator-reported hyperkalaemia or the initiation of potassium
binders. We also analysed effects on central laboratory-determined hyper- and hypokalaemia (serum potassium
>_6.0 and <3.5 mmol/L, respectively) and change in serum potassium. At baseline, the mean serum potassium in canagliflozin and placebo arms was 4.5 mmol/L; 4395 (99.9%) participants were receiving renin-angiotensin system blockade. The incidence of investigator-reported hyperkalaemia or initiation of potassium binders was lower with canagliflozin than with placebo [occurring in 32.7 vs. 41.9 participants per 1000 patient-years; hazard ratio (HR) 0.78, 95%
confidence interval (CI) 0.64-0.95, P = 0.014]. Canagliflozin similarly reduced the incidence of laboratory-determined
hyperkalaemia (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.61-0.98, P = 0.031), with no effect on the risk of hypokalaemia (HR 0.92, 95% CI
0.71-1.20, P = 0.53). The mean serum potassium over time with canagliflozin was similar to that of placebo.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
Among patients treated with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibition with canagliflozin
may reduce the risk of hyperkalaemia in people with T2DM and CKD without increasing the risk of hypokalaemia.

Introduction
Hyperkalaemia occurs frequently in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and chronic kidney disease (CKD), increasing in incidence as kidney function declines, and is associated with
discontinuation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAAS) inhibitors
due to its potential to cause life-threatening arrhythmias that are clinically relevant to both physicians and patients.1-3 In individuals with
CKD, the association between serum potassium and adverse outcomes is U-shaped such that both high and low levels are associated
with increased risk of hospitalization and death.4,5
Inhibition of the RAAS system with angiotensin-converting enzyme
(ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) is the
standard of care for people with T2DM and CKD, but these agents
are known to increase the risk of hyperkalaemia,6 contributing at

least partly to non-prescription or discontinuation of these agents in
routine clinical practice.7 More recently, the non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, finerenone, has been shown to reduce
the risk of kidney disease progression and cardiovascular events in
people with T2DM and CKD.8 However, finerenone also increased
the risk of hyperkalaemia.
Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors reduce the
risk of kidney failure and cardiovascular events in people with
CKD or heart failure, irrespective of the presence or absence of
T2DM.9-11 In people with preserved kidney function, SGLT2 inhibitors may enhance potassium excretion by the kidney through a combination of increased sodium and water delivery to the distal
nephron, enhanced glycosuria, and stimulation of aldosterone.12,13
However, the effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on serum potassium and
risk of hyperkalaemia in people with CKD is uncertain. While initial

Effects of canagliflozin on serum potassium

Methods
Data availability
Data from this study will be made available in the public domain via the
Yale University Open Data Access Project (http://yoda.yale.edu/) once
the product and relevant indication studied have been approved by regulators in the USA and European Union and the study has been completed
for 18 months.

Study design and participants
The design, statistical analysis plan, and main results of the CREDENCE
trial have been published previously.15,16 Briefly, CREDENCE was a
double-blind, event-driven, randomized, placebo-controlled trial assessing the effect of canagliflozin on major kidney, cardiovascular, and safety
outcomes in people with T2DM and CKD. The trial was conducted in
695 sites across 34 countries. The trial protocol was approved by local institutional ethics committees at each site and all participants provided
written informed consent.
The trial enrolled participants with glycated haemoglobin between
6.5% and 12% who had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of
30-90 mL/min/1.73 m2 and a urinary albumin:creatinine ratio (UACR) of
>300 mg/g. The Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration
(CKD-EPI) formula was used to calculate eGFR. All participants were
required to be receiving maximum tolerated or labelled dose of ACE inhibitor or ARB for at least 4 weeks prior to randomization. Key exclusion
criteria included type 1 diabetes, non-diabetic kidney disease, current use
of a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, and serum potassium
>5.5 mmol/L at baseline.

Randomization and follow-up procedures
All eligible participants underwent a 2-week, single-blind, placebo runin period before being randomized to either canagliflozin 100 mg or
matching placebo once daily. Randomization was performed centrally
using a computer-generated randomization schedule and randomly
permuted blocks stratified by pre-randomization eGFR (30 to <45, 45
to <60, 60 to <90 mL/min/1.73 m2). All participants, care providers,
and study investigators were blinded to treatment allocation until the
end of the trial.
After randomization, study visits were conducted at Weeks 3, 13, and
26 and then alternated between clinic and telephone follow-up at 13week intervals thereafter. Blood tests for serum potassium were done at
each study visit (i.e. every 6 months) and measured at a central laboratory. We identified potassium-related outcomes by searching the
CREDENCE trial database, held at the George Institute for Global
Health, Sydney, Australia, for (i) investigator-reported adverse events,
(ii) investigator initiated concomitant medications, and (iii) central

..
.. laboratory values. First, we identified spontaneous investigator-reported
.. hyperkalaemia and hypokalaemia events by searching the adverse event
.. database. Definitions of hyper- and hypokalaemia were based on the
..
.. Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) preferred terms
.. of 'hyperkalaemia', 'blood potassium increased', 'hypokalaemia', and
..
.. 'blood potassium decreased'. Second, we searched the concomitant
.. medications database to identify new initiation of potassium binders dur.. ing the trial, including sodium polystyrene sulfonate, calcium polystyrene
..
.. sulfonate, patiromer, or sodium zirconium. Third, we identified hyperka.. laemia events using laboratory-based definitions; serious hyperkalaemia
..
.. was defined as serum potassium >_6.0 mmol/L and hypokalaemia was
.. defined as <3.5 mmol/L.
..
..
..
.. Outcomes
.. In this post hoc analysis, the main outcome was a composite of investiga..
.. tor-reported hyperkalaemia events or the initiation of potassium binders.
.. Other potassium-related outcomes included investigator-reported
..
.. hyperkalaemia events; initiation of potassium binders; hyperkalaemia,
.. defined as a serum potassium >_6.0 mmol/L; investigator-reported hypo.. kalaemia; hypokalaemia, defined as a serum potassium <3.5 mmol/L; and
..
.. mean difference in serum potassium over time. In sensitivity analyses, we
.. defined hyperkalaemia and lower serum potassium using >_5.5 and
..
.. <4.0 mmol/L cut-off values, respectively.
..
..
..
.. Statistical analysis
.. Trends across categories of baseline serum potassium were tested by lin.. ear regression analysis, logistic regression analysis, and v2 test, as
..
.. appropriate.
..
The effect of canagliflozin on the main outcome of investigator..
.. reported hyperkalaemia events or the initiation of potassium binders was
.. assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression models with
..
.. stratification by screening eGFR categories. We used a similar approach
.. for other dichotomous secondary outcomes. The primary analytical ap.. proach was done using the intention-to-treat principle, with on..
.. treatment analysis done as sensitivity analyses. The on-treatment dataset
.. was defined as all randomized participants followed for up to 30 days
.. after the last dose, which was pre-specified for safety analyses in the pri..
.. mary trial report. We assessed the consistency of the effect on the main
.. outcome across a range of clinically relevant participant characteristics
..
.. including age, sex, screening eGFR, UACR, duration of diabetes, history
.. of heart failure, cardiovascular disease, diuretic use, baseline serum potas.. sium; P-interaction values were obtained using likelihood ratio tests com..
.. paring nested models with and without subgroup by treatment
.. interaction terms with no adjustment for multiplicity.
..
To assess the impact of concomitant medication use that may have
..
.. affected serum potassium levels during the trial, we evaluated the use of
..
.. potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, eplerenone, amiloride, or
.. triamterene), mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (spironolactone or
.. eplerenone), loop diuretics (frusemide, torsemide, bumetanide, etacrynic
..
.. acid), and discontinuation of RAAS blockade during follow-up across can.. agliflozin and placebo arms.
..
The mean difference in serum potassium over time between canagliflo..
.. zin and placebo arms was assessed using linear mixed-effects models that
.. included all post-baseline data up to Week 182. The model included cat..
.. egorical covariates for randomized treatment allocation, visit, screening
.. eGFR, treatment by visit interaction, and two continuous covariates:
..
.. baseline serum potassium and baseline potassium-by-visit interaction.
.. The variance-covariance matrix was assumed to be unstructured, i.e.
.. purely data dependent.

studies with canagliflozin suggested a possible increased risk of hyperkalaemia in people with T2DM and preserved kidney function, longer-term data did not show such risk; however, the effects on the risk
of hyperkalaemia remain undefined because few patients in the earlier SGLT2 inhibitor studies had CKD.14
We hypothesized that canagliflozin might reduce the risk of hyperkalaemia in people with T2DM and CKD and sought to assess the effect of canagliflozin on a range of potassium-related outcomes in this
population at the high risk of hyperkalaemia, by conducting a post hoc
analysis of the Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with
Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation (CREDENCE) trial.

In additional exploratory analyses, we assessed the association between baseline serum potassium levels and adverse outcomes as well as
the effect of canagliflozin vs. placebo on key kidney and cardiovascular
outcomes across baseline levels of serum potassium. We assessed the association between baseline serum potassium levels and kidney and cardiovascular outcomes (doubling of serum creatinine, kidney failure,
kidney or cardiovascular death; doubling of serum creatinine, kidney failure or kidney death; cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction or
stroke; and cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure) using
multivariable Cox regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, race, current
smoking, history of hypertension, history of heart failure, duration of diabetes, history of cardiovascular disease, body mass index, systolic blood
pressure, glycated haemoglobin, eGFR, log-transformed urinary albuminto-creatinine ratio, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, log-transformed
triglycerides, diuretic use, and randomized treatment (canagliflozin or placebo). We assessed the effect of canagliflozin on these outcomes according to baseline serum potassium levels using Cox regression models
stratified by screening eGFR, as has been done previously.17 P-interaction
values were obtained from the relevant model using the same approach
as for the main potassium outcome.
All P-values were two-sided and 0.05 was used as the level of significance. Analyses were done using SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute Inc.,

Results
CREDENCE included 4401 participants of whom 4397 (99.9%) had
serum potassium measured at baseline. The mean baseline serum potassium was 4.5 mmol/L (SD 0.5) in both canagliflozin and placebo
arms. Few participants were receiving potassium-sparing diuretics at
baseline [20 (0.9%) and 15 (0.7%), respectively, for canagliflozin and
placebo arms]. Of these, 24 (0.5%) were receiving a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist at baseline. Potassium binder use at baseline
was also uncommon [15 (0.7%) and 11 (0.5%) for canagliflozin and
placebo-treated participants, respectively], with no participants
receiving novel agents (i.e. patiromer or sodium zirconium) at baseline or during follow-up.
The number of participants with serum potassium <4.0, 4.0-4.5,
>4.5-5.0, and >5.0 mmol/L at randomization was 582 (13.2%), 1849
(42.0%), 1303 (29.6%), and 663 (15.1%), respectively. In total, 151

(3.4%) participants had a baseline serum potassium >5.5 mmol/L. The
distribution of serum potassium values at baseline is displayed in
Supplementary material online, Figure S1. Participants with higher levels of baseline potassium were more likely to have a lower eGFR, history of microvascular complications and peripheral vascular disease
(Table 1).
Over a median follow-up of 2.6 years, 179 (8.1%) canagliflozintreated participants and 226 (10.3%) placebo-treated participants
experienced the composite outcome of investigator-reported hyperkalaemia or initiation of potassium binders. Canagliflozin reduced the
relative risk of the composite outcome by 22% [32.7 vs. 41.9 participants per 1000 patient-years; hazard ratio (HR) 0.78, 95% confidence
interval (CI) 0.64-0.95, P = 0.014; Figure 1]. A similar effect was
observed for investigator-reported hyperkalaemia alone (HR 0.82,
95% CI 0.67-1.01, P = 0.063). Initiation of potassium binders
occurred less frequently in the canagliflozin compared with placebo
arm (HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.46-0.95, P = 0.027). Canagliflozin reduced
the incidence of central laboratory-determined serum potassium
>_6 mmol/L (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.61-0.98, P = 0.031). The effects of
canagliflozin on hyperkalaemia-related outcomes are summarized in
Figure 2. Results were similar in on-treatment sensitivity analysis, with
statistically significant results observed for both investigator-reported
and laboratory-defined hyperkalaemia (Supplementary material online, Table S1). No clear effect on hyperkalaemia was observed when
defined as a central laboratory-determined serum potassium level
>_5.5 mmol/L (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.83-1.04, P = 0.21). In the majority of
cases of investigator-reported hyperkalaemia (84%), randomized
treatment remained unchanged, though drug interruption or withdrawal occurred more commonly in placebo-treated participants
(Supplementary material online, Table S2).
The effect of canagliflozin on serum potassium over time is displayed in Figure 3. Mean serum potassium levels increased in both
canagliflozin and placebo arms during the trial. There was no significant difference in mean serum potassium levels between canagliflozin
and placebo-treated participants over the duration of the trial (placebo-subtracted difference 0.00039 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.018 to 0.019,
P = 0.97; Figure 3). Effects were similar across different levels of

baseline potassium (P-interaction = 0.95; Supplementary material online, Table S3).
There were some differences in the use of medications affecting
serum potassium across canagliflozin and placebo arms. In addition to
the more frequent initiation of potassium binders in placebo-treated
participants (Figure 2), loop diuretic use was also more common in
placebo-treated participants post-randomization (Supplementary
material online, Figure S2), as was the discontinuation of RAAS blockade (Supplementary material online, Figure S3). However, there was
no difference in the use of potassium-sparing diuretics and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists across canagliflozin and placebo arms,
which were initiated in <4% of participants after randomization
(Supplementary material online, Figures S4 and S5).
The incidence of investigator-reported hypokalaemia and of serum
potassium <3.5 mmol/L was low overall (Figure 4). Canagliflozin did
not increase the risk of investigator-reported hypokalaemia events
(HR 1.20, 95% CI 0.71-2.04, P = 0.50), with similar findings observed
for central laboratory measured potassium <3.5 mmol/L (HR 0.92,
95% CI 0.71-1.20, P = 0.53). Canagliflozin also did not increase the
risk of a lower serum potassium defined as <4.0 mmol/L (HR 0.92,
95% CI 0.82-1.02; P = 0.13).
The effect of canagliflozin on the composite outcome of investigator-reported hyperkalaemia or initiation of potassium binders was
broadly consistent across a range of baseline characteristics, including
age, sex, history of heart failure, established cardiovascular disease,
baseline serum potassium, eGFR, UACR, and diuretic use (all P-interaction >0.05; Figure 5). In an additional analysis, the effect of canagliflozin on hyperkalaemia defined as central laboratory serum
potassium >_6.0 mmol/L was similar in participants with baseline
eGFR 30-60 and 60-90 mL/min/1.73 m2 (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.65-1.03
and HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.47-1.02; P-interaction = 0.46).
In additional analyses, we explored both the association between
serum potassium levels and adverse outcomes and the consistency of
the effect of canagliflozin on kidney and cardiovascular outcomes
across different levels of baseline serum potassium. We observed a
U-shaped association between serum potassium levels and kidney
and cardiovascular outcomes such that serum potassium levels <4.0

Effects of canagliflozin on serum potassium

and >5.0 mmol/L were associated with increased risk of adverse outcomes (Supplementary material online, Figure S6). There was some
evidence that the magnitude of benefit with canagliflozin was greater
at higher levels of baseline serum potassium levels for the primary
endpoint in the CREDENCE trial (a composite outcome of kidney
failure, doubling of serum creatinine, cardiovascular, or kidney death;
P-interaction = 0.03; Supplementary material online, Table S4).
However, the effect of canagliflozin on the kidney-specific composite
outcome of kidney failure, doubling of serum creatinine or kidney
death was consistent across different levels of baseline serum potassium (P-interaction = 0.31), as were effects on key cardiovascular
outcomes, including cardiovascular death or hospitalization for
heart failure (P-interaction = 0.14; Supplementary material online,
Table S4).

Discussion
Individuals with T2DM and CKD experience a high rate of hyperkalaemia, which can result in discontinuation of kidney protective therapies, hospitalization, and life-threatening arrhythmias.18 In this post
hoc analysis of the CREDENCE trial, we observed that canagliflozin
reduced the risk of investigator-reported hyperkalaemia or initiation
of potassium binders compared with placebo, with a similarly significant reduction in risk of central laboratory-determined hyperkalaemia, defined as a serum potassium >_6.0 mmol/L (Graphical abstract).
The lower risk of hyperkalaemia with canagliflozin is notable since it
was observed on a background of near-universal use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs as mandated for entry into the CREDENCE trial.
The validity of our findings is strengthened by results from completed T2DM cardiovascular outcome and heart failure trials of other
agents within the class. In EMPA-REG OUTCOME, the risk of

hyperkalaemia was lower with empagliflozin vs. placebo (incident
rate ratio 0.57, 95% CI 0.42-0.77).19 The incidence of investigatorreported hyperkalaemia was also numerically lower in the cardiovascular outcome trials for canagliflozin (CANVAS Program)20 and
dapagliflozin (DECLARE-TIMI 58).21 In the DAPA-HF trial, in which
more than two-third of participants were receiving mineralocorticoid
receptor antagonists at baseline, dapagliflozin significantly reduced
the incidence of serious hyperkalaemia, defined as serum potassium
>6.0 mmol/L (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.42-0.99), with greater benefit in
those receiving mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists at baseline.22
Our results extend these observations to people with T2DM and
CKD, who are at higher risk of serious hyperkalaemia. Importantly,
the effects of canagliflozin on hyperkalaemia outcomes did not appear to be explained by the differential concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists
during the trial, which were similar in both treatment arms. Indeed,
the reduction in risk of hyperkalaemia with canagliflozin was
observed despite more frequent initiation of potassium binders, use
of loop diuretics, and discontinuation of RAAS blockade over time in
the placebo arm, which would be expected to lower serum potassium and limit our ability to detect effects on hyperkalaemia.
The lower risk of hyperkalaemia with canagliflozin in people with
T2DM and CKD contrasts with agents that inhibit the RAAS system,
which are known to increase the risk of hyperkalaemia. While ACE
inhibitors and ARBs have formed the foundations of treatment for
slowing the progression of kidney disease for almost two decades,
their optimal use and dosing in people with CKD have been limited at
least partly by hyperkalaemia, especially as kidney function declines.
In people with advanced CKD, hyperkalaemia is a major factor influencing the discontinuation of ACE inhibitors and ARBs.2,23 Recently,
the FIDELIO-DKD trial (Finerenone in Subjects With Type 2
Diabetes Mellitus and Diabetic Kidney Disease) demonstrated that

the non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist finerenone
can slow the progression of kidney disease and prevent cardiovascular events in people with T2DM and CKD.8 However, an increased
risk of hyperkalaemia was observed, despite a serum potassium level
<_4.8 mmol/L being required for entry into the trial. A similar challenge exists in the management of patients with heart failure with
reduced ejection fraction, where hyperkalaemia limits the use of
RAAS blockade and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists,24 which
are key components of disease-modifying pharmacological therapy in
this population.25 Furthermore, the optimal strategy for managing
chronic hyperkalaemia remains uncertain; while newer potassium
binders may facilitate greater use of RAAS blockade, there remains
concern about the long-term safety of sodium polystyrene sulfonate,
especially serious gastrointestinal adverse effects,26 which remains
the most commonly used potassium binder in many parts of the
world.
In this context, our study has important implications for the care
of people with T2DM and CKD. While clinical practice guidelines
now recommend RAAS blockade plus SGLT2 inhibition for most
people with T2DM and CKD,27 the benefits of finerenone on major
kidney and cardiovascular outcomes in this population raise questions about whether combination treatment with all three agents
should be routinely offered to patients with T2DM and CKD.8 The
risk of hyperkalaemia is also greater in people with T2DM and CKD,
compared with non-diabetic kidney disease, in large part due to coexisting type 4 renal tubular acidosis.28 The effect of canagliflozin on
hyperkalaemia may make combined treatment with all three classes
of agent more feasible. Additionally, many patients are unable to tolerate RAAS blockade due to hyperkalaemia. A 2019 meta-analysis of

CREDENCE and cardiovascular outcome trials observed consistent
benefits for kidney outcomes regardless of the baseline use of RAAS
blockade.9 For individuals unable to tolerate RAAS blockade due to
hyperkalaemia, treatment with an SGLT2 inhibitor alone may be a
reasonable alternative, given the lower risk of hyperkalaemia with
these agents.
The mechanisms underpinning the effect of canagliflozin on hyperkalaemia are uncertain. Under normal conditions, key determinants
of potassium excretion by the kidney include the rate of sodium and
water delivery to the distal nephron and stimulation of aldosterone.
In people with T2DM, and in those treated with an SGLT2 inhibitor,
glycosuria, and the resultant osmotic diuresis also contributes to
kaliuresis. By inhibiting SGLT2 in the proximal tubule, canagliflozin
increases distal sodium delivery and reabsorption, thus enhancing the
electronegative charge in the tubular lumen that drives potassium secretion via the principle cell at the cortical collecting duct.29 Effects
on aldosterone could also affect distal potassium handling although
the effects of SGLT2 inhibition on this pathway are complex and not
well understood.12
Alternatively, the lower incidence of hyperkalaemia may partly reflect the preservation of kidney function with canagliflozin, rather
than direct effects on sodium-potassium handling by the kidney. The
neutral effect on serum potassium over time could support this hypothesis. In both treatment arms, mean serum potassium levels
increased during the study, which is likely to reflect loss of kidney
function over time, given the study population was enriched for individuals at high risk of kidney disease progression. The separation of
the Kaplan-Meier curves at 18 months for the composite outcome
of investigator-reported hyperkalaemia or initiation of potassium

diuretics and greater discontinuation of RAAS blockade in placebotreated participants during the trial-all of which lower serum potassium levels-could explain the neutral effects on mean serum potassium over time. It is also important to note that mean changes in
serum potassium levels in the overall trial population may also not reflect the true risk of hyperkalaemia; in the FIDELIO-DKD,
ALTITUDE (Aliskiren Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardiorenal
Endpoints) and VA-NEPHRON D (Veterans Affairs Nephropathy in
Diabetes) trials, increases in risk of hyperkalaemia were observed
with active treatment despite relatively modest changes in mean
serum potassium over time (0.2 mmol/L).8,30,31
These results should be interpreted in light of certain limitations.
This was a post hoc analysis of the CREDENCE trial with the inherent
drawbacks of such an approach. Hyperkalaemia events were investigator reported, not adjudicated, and therefore potentially variable across
study sites. With sodium polystyrene sulfonate being available in virtually all countries participating in CREDENCE, initiation of potassium
binders was also at the discretion of treating physicians according to
local guidelines with no specific recommendations on hyperkalaemia
management in the trial protocol. However, the consistency of the effect on investigator-reported hyperkalaemia with results based on central laboratory values and in on-treatment sensitivity analyses, as well
as with data from other large-scale SGLT2 inhibitor trials provides
some reassurance with regard to the robustness of the findings.
Newer potassium binders (patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilate) were not prescribed at baseline and were almost seldom used
during follow-up by virtue of the fact that these drugs were not registered for use in most countries at the time the trial was conducted. As
such, our findings are unlikely to be influenced by the use of these
agents. Because serum potassium was measured at 6-month intervals,
we were unable to identify the exact time at which individuals developed hyper- or hypokalaemia. Thus interval censoring and differences
in frequency of serial biochemical analyses compared with investigator-reported events could have contributed to the time at which
Kaplan-Meier curves separated for the different hyperkalaemia outcomes. Ultimately, we were unable to address the question of whether
canagliflozin reduces the risk of hyperkalaemia through enhanced kaliuresis or other mechanisms as we did not assess fractional excretion of
potassium. Regardless of hypothesized mechanisms, confirmation of a
cause-and-effect relationship would require a dedicated randomized
controlled trial. Finally, due to the exclusion criteria of the
CREDENCE trial, whether these findings are generalizable to individuals with non-diabetic CKD or to people with CKD receiving mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists is uncertain.
In summary, canagliflozin may reduce the risk of hyperkalaemia in
people with T2DM and CKD without any adverse effect on incident
hypokalaemia. Further prospective studies are required to confirm
these findings.

In the originally published version of this manuscript, there were multiple errors in formatting and content. Figures 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 12, 19, and
20 have been replaced with corrected versions. The wording of the recommendation "Tafamidis is recommended in patients with genetic
testing proven hereditary hTTR-CMP and NYHA class I or II symptoms to reduce symptoms, CV hospitalization and mortality." has been
corrected to: "Tafamidis is recommended in patients with genetic testing proven hTTR-CA and NYHA class I or II symptoms to reduce
symptoms, CV hospitalization and mortality." The wording of the recommendation "Monitoring of pulmonary artery pressure using a wireless haemodynamic monitoring system may be considered in symptomatic patients with HFrEF (LVEF <_ 35%) in order to improve clinical
outcomes." has been corrected to: "Monitoring of pulmonary artery pressure using a wireless haemodynamic monitoring system may be
considered in symptomatic patients with HF in order to improve clinical outcomes." Minor changes have also been made to the formatting
and content of the text, tables, and footnotes.
