Aims

The aim of this study was to investigate the cross-sectional associations of modelled residential road traffic noise
with cardiovascular disease risk factors [systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), C-reactive protein, triglycerides, glycated haemoglobin, and self-reported hypertension] in UK Biobank.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
The UK Biobank recruited 502 651 individuals aged 40-69 years across the UK during 2006-10. Road traffic noise
and results
(Lden and Lnight) exposure for 2009 was estimated at baseline address using a simplified version of the Common

Noise Assessment Methods model. We used multivariable linear and logistic regression models, adjusting for age,
sex, body mass index (BMI), smoking, alcohol intake, area- and individual-level deprivation, season of blood draw,
length of time at residence, and nitrogen dioxide (main model), in an analytical sample size of over 370 000 participants. Exposure to road-traffic Lden >65 dB[A], as compared to <_55 dB[A], was associated with 0.77% [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60%, 0.95%], 0.49% (95% CI 0.32%, 0.65%), 0.79% (95% CI 0.11%, 1.47%), and 0.12% (95% CI
-0.04%, 0.28%) higher SBP, DBP, triglycerides, and glycated haemoglobin, respectively. Removing BMI from the
main model yielded significant positive associations with all five markers with elevated percent changes. The associations with SBP or DBP did not appear to be impacted by hypertension medication while a positive association
with prevalent self-reported hypertension was seen in the non-medicated group who exposed to a Lden level of
60-65 dB[A] (odds ratio 1.07, 95% CI 1.00, 1.15).

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
Exposure to road traffic noise >65 dB[A], independent of nitrogen dioxide, was associated with small but adverse
changes in blood pressure and cardiovascular biochemistry.

Introduction
Road traffic noise is an important environmental risk factor for
cardiovascular disease (CVD), as increasingly reported in both observational and experimental studies.1 However, the biological mechanisms underlying the association remain to be thoroughly elucidated.
A proposed hypothesis suggests that chronic exposure to noise leads
to activation of the autonomic and endocrine system, generating unfavourable changes in traditional risk factors such as blood pressure,
blood lipids, and blood glucose which, if left untreated, will manifest
in CVD.2 Long-term sleep disturbance as a result of night-time noise
exposure can also impact cardiovascular health due to repeated
arousal and activation of the stress cascade via autonomic and endocrine systems.3
Of all the cardiovascular outcomes examined to date, the relationship between road traffic noise and hypertension is the most
studied. A meta-analysis by the World Health Organisation
reported a 5% increase in prevalence of hypertension [95% confidence interval (CI) 2%, 8%] per 10 dB of road traffic noise based
on 26 cross-sectional studies published up to 2014, for which the
overall quality of evidence was rated as very low.4 Another metaanalysis of 14 cohort and case-control studies published between
2011 and 2017 reported a relative risk of 1.02 (95% CI 0.98,

1.05), for which the overall quality of evidence was rated as low.5
Both reviews indicated that further research is very likely to have
an important impact on the estimated risk. Only a few studies
have investigated the relationship with continuous blood pressure
traits in adults and reported heterogeneous results. Some only
observed a positive association with either systolic blood pressure
(SBP)6-8 or diastolic blood pressure (DBP).9 One study found a
null association with either measure.10 The pooled analysis of
over 88 000 participants from three European cohorts was the
largest study but reported negative associations with both measures.11 Studies of C-reactive protein (CRP), blood lipids and glucose are still very limited.12-14 Traffic-related air pollution, the
impact of which on cardiovascular health is well documented,15
has the potential to confound associations between road traffic
noise exposure and cardiovascular outcomes and, therefore,
should be considered when attempting to disentangle road traffic
noise effects.
Here, we examined cross-sectional associations of long-term residential road traffic noise with SBP, DBP, triglycerides, glycated
haemoglobin, CRP, and self-reported hypertension, accounting for
individual-level confounders including traffic-related air pollution in
the largest study to date involving over 370 000 participants in UK
Biobank.

In the largest analysis to date of over 370,000 UK Biobank participants, exposure to high road traffic noise levels greater than 65dB, as compared to less
than 55dB, was associated with 0.77%, 0.49%, 0.79% and 0.12% changes in SBP, DBP, triglycerides and glycated haemoglobin respectively, independent in
nitrogen dioxide.

Methods
Study population

Cardiovascular risk factors
Non-fasting blood samples were collected and transported in
temperature-controlled boxes for storage. Serum concentrations of
high-sensitivity CRP (mg/L), triglycerides (mmol/L), and glycated haemoglobin (mmol/mol) were analysed using immunoturbidimetric, glycerol
phosphate oxidase peroxidase and high-performance liquid chromatography, respectively.18 SBP and DBP (mmHg) were measured twice using
a digital Omron HEM-7015IT monitor, following a standard protocol.19
The mean of two measures of SBP and DBP was obtained to account for
random fluctuations.

Noise exposure assessment
Address-level annual mean road traffic noise estimates were modelled
using a simplified version of the Common Noise Assessment Methods in
Europe model, developed and validated for epidemiological studies.20,21
This simplified model has relatively good performance on exposure ranking (Spearman ratio: 0.75)21 and has been used in previous analyses.14
Annual mean A-weighted sounds pressure level in decibels (dB[A]) for
2009 was estimated based on all road sources within 500 m of residential
address. The model considered detailed information on noise propagation (refraction and diffraction), absorption from buildings and land use,
distance between receptor and source and angle of view, meteorology,
building heights, land cover, road network geography, and calculated
hourly vehicle flows using a daily average traffic profile. We used the noise
indicator Lden (weighted average 24-h noise sound level, with a penalty of
5 and 10 dB added to the evening hours and night hours, respectively)
and Lnight (average sound pressure level during night-time hours 23:00-
07:00), to be comparable to previous studies.

Covariates
Age (in years continuous), sex (female, male), smoking status (current,
past, never), alcohol intake frequency (daily or almost daily, 3-4 times a
week, 1-2 times a week, occasional drinker, never), use of antihypertensive medication, and self-reported hypertension and diabetes ('ever-had')
were obtained from questionnaires. Body mass index (BMI, kg/m2) was
calculated using height (cm) and weight (kg) measured after removal of
heavy clothes and shoes. Season of blood draw (spring, summer, autumn,
winter) was recorded during clinical measurements. Time at residence of
recruitment in years was obtained. Household income before tax
(<lb18 000, lb18 000-lb30 999, lb31 000-51 999, lb52 000-lb100 000,
>lb100 000) and economic activity (economically active (paid employment), economically inactive (unpaid employment, unemployment,
housework, retired, etc.) was used as proxies for individual socioeconomic status. Townsend deprivation index (quintiles: most deprived to
least deprived) is a composite area-level indicator of material deprivation
based on unemployment, non-car ownership, non-house ownership, and
household overcrowding using information from the UK 2011 Census.

.. Address-level annual average concentrations for nitrogen dioxide (NO ),
2
..
.. a primary indicator of roadside air pollution, and particulate matter with a
.. diameter of <2.5 lm (PM2.5), for which road vehicles are important emis..
.. sion sources, were integrated into UK Biobank as part of a previous
.. study.22,23 Land-use regression models were used to predict annual aver..
.. age NO2 and PM2.5 exposure at address for year 2010. The models used
.. AirBase routine monitoring data with geospatial variables on road net.. work (road class, road length), land use (residential, natural, industry,
..
.. urban green), population density and altitude. The model performance
.. [explained variance (R2) between modelled and measured exposures]
..
.. was 89% and 82%, for NO2 and PM2.5 respectively.
..
..
.. Statistical analysis
.. Descriptive analysis was conducted for covariates, exposures, and out.. comes in the whole population. Spearman correlations between road
..
.. traffic noise metrics and air pollutants were calculated.
..
The distribution of noise metric Lden was right skewed and therefore
..
.. categorized as <_55, >55 to <_60, >60 to <_65, and >65 dB[A] in the ana.. lysis. The reference value was set at 55 dB[A] as it is close to the median
..
.. of Lden and a suggested health effect threshold set by European Union.
.. Categorization was also applied to Lnight as <_45, >45 to <_ 50, >50 to
.. <_55, and >55 dB[A]. The reference value was set at 45 dB[A] following
..
.. the 2018 European noise guideline.24 Each risk factor was examined as a
.. log-transformed continuous outcome to address skewness of data. CRP
..
.. levels >10 mg/L were encoded as missing as levels above this value may
.. indicate a current infection.14
..
Association between residential annual mean road traffic noise (Lden or
..
.. Lnight) and each risk factor was analysed using multivariable linear regres.. sion. For the binary outcome of self-reported hypertension, multivariable
..
.. logistic regression was used. Results for SBP, DBP, triglycerides, glycated
.. haemoglobin and CRP were presented as percent change and 95% CI in
..
.. mean differences between the reference group and other groups while
.. results for self-reported hypertension were presented as odds ratios
.. (ORs) and 95% CI.
..
..
The models were as follows: Model 1: unadjusted; Model 2: fully
.. adjusted model with adjustment for age, sex, BMI, smoking status, alcohol
..
.. intake frequency, household income, Townsend deprivation index, time
.. at residence, season of blood draw, economic activity; Model 3: Model 2
..
.. further adjusted for NO2; and Model 4: Model 2 further adjusted for
.. PM2.5. Most previous studies have accounted for NO2 effects; to facilitate
.. comparisons, we set a priori Model 3 as the main model in our study.
..
..
Sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of Model 3:
.. (i) adjustment without BMI as BMI may be on the causal pathway; (ii) fur..
.. ther adjustment for ever-had hypertension and diabetes to capture high.. risk individuals; (iii) to address the potential issue of missing data, we used
..
.. multiple imputation (m = 20) using chained equations with fully condition.. al specification of prediction equations. All covariates were included in
.. the imputation equation; (iv) to repeat the analysis of categorical L by
den
..
.. lowering the reference value to 52 dB[A], which is close to the 5th per.. centile of Lden distribution. The corresponding categories were <_52, >52
..
.. to <_55, >55 to <_58, >58 to <_61, >61 to <_64 and >64 dB[A]. An incre.. ment of 3 dB was chosen as it represents a doubling of sound energy lev.. els, which is audible to human ear as a small change in loudness.25
..
..
For the analyses on SBP, DBP and self-reported hypertension in Model
.. 3, we further investigated the role of antihypertensive medication. As
..
.. with a previous study,26 we tested different approaches: (i) to further ad.. just for medication; (ii) to restrict analyses to participants on medication;
..
.. and (iii) to restrict analyses to non-medicated participants. To examine
.. the assumption of linearity between Lden and SBP or DBP, we conducted
.. restricted cubic splines analyses by placing three knots at 55, 60 and
..
. 65 dB[A] of the Lden distribution.

A total of 502 651 individuals aged 40-69 years living within 25 miles of
one of the 22 study assessment centres across the UK were recruited
into UK Biobank during baseline assessment from 2006 to 2010.16 A
comprehensive set of individual-level data was provided by participants
using touchscreen questionnaires while biological and physical measurements were also collected. Despite a relatively low response rate (5.5%),
risk factor associations in UK Biobank are likely generalizable.17 All participants provided written consent and ethical approval was obtained from
the North West Multi-Centre Research Ethical Committee and Patient
Information Advisory Group.

We explored effect modification in Model 3 a priori by sex, age (>_65

using STATA/IC v 15.1.

Effect modification by sex was observed for SBP, glycated haemo..

The analytical sample included 502 521 participants, 54.4% were female and mean age was 56.5 years (Table 1). The mean Lden exposure
was 56.1 dB[A], ranging from 51.5 to 93.4 dB[A]. About 12% of the
study participants were exposed to a residential Lden >60 dB[A]. The
mean NO2 and PM2.5 exposure levels were 26.7 and 9.9 lg/m3.
Spearman's correlation coefficients between Lden and NO2 (0.23) or
PM2.5 (0.24) were low but were high between Lden and Lnight (0.99)
and between NO2 and PM2.5 (0.85).
In the fully adjusted Model 2, exposure to road-Lden >65 dB[A], as
compared to those exposed <_55 dB[A], was positively associated
with SBP [0.11% (95% CI -0.05, 0.28)]; after further adjustment for
NO2 or PM2.5 exposure, the effect estimate changed to 0.77% (95%
CI 0.60, 0.95) (Model 3) and 0.32% (95% CI 0.15, 0.49) (Model 4), respectively (Table 2 and Figure 1). Similarly, for DBP, after further adjustment for NO2 or PM2.5, the effect estimate changed from 0.09%
(95% CI -0.07, 0.24) to 0.49% (95% CI 0.32, 0.65) and 0.26% (95% CI
0.10, 0.43), respectively. The restricted cubic spline analysis showed
that the relationship between road-Lden and SBP or DBP only seems
to be linear at levels >60 dB (Figure 2). No positive association between road-Lden and prevalence of self-reported hypertension was
observed in the adjusted models (Table 2).
The significant positive associations with both SBP and DBP found
in the highest noise group in Model 3 did not appear to be affected by
further adjusting for antihypertensive medication use or restricting
analyses to those with or without medication (Table 3). In contrast,
higher positive ORs were observed for self-reported hypertension
among the non-medicated participants who exposed to road-Lden of
55-60 dB (1.03, 95% CI 0.99, 1.06) and of 60-65 dB (1.07, 95% CI
1.00, 1.15), but the association was null in the highest noise group.
In the fully adjusted Model 2, exposure to road-Lden >65 dB[A], as
opposed to those exposed <_55 dB[A], was negatively associated
with triglycerides [-1.04% (95% CI -1.68, -0.41)]; after further adjustment for NO2 exposure, there was a significant positive association
[0.79% (95% CI 0.11, 1.47)] (Table 2 and Figure 1). However, when
PM2.5 was further adjusted, the direction and strength of the association was opposite to those in which adjustment of NO2 was made.
Comparing road-Lden >65 vs. <_55 dB[A], a positive association
was found with glycated haemoglobin [0.15% (95% CI -0.01, 0.30)] in
Model 2; after further adjustment for either air pollutant did not
change the effect estimate materially (Table 2 and Figure 1).
Associations with CRP were largely negative and non-significant, except in the model when PM2.5 was further considered [-1.28% (95%
CI -2.46, -0.08)].
Similar significant positive associations were observed for SBP,
DBP and triglycerides when comparing Lnight >55 vs. <_ 45 dB[A] in
the models further adjusted for NO2 (Supplementary material online,
Appendix SA).
Sensitivity analyses on our main model, Model 3 (Model 2 further
adjusted for NO2), by not adjusting for BMI, altered the results

participants, or diabetic individuals),6,8 or when night-time indoor
bedroom noise exposure (i.e. with reduced exposure misclassification) was used in the analysis.7 In contrast, a German study only
observed a significant positive association with DBP but not SBP, and
the association was stronger among men or diabetic individuals.9 A
London study analysed night-time road traffic noise at both continuous and categorical scales but found no association with either blood
pressure measure.10 These studies had a sample size ranging from
2500 to 44 000 participants. A pooled analysis of individual-level data
from three European cohorts (Lifelines, HUNT3, and EPIC-Oxford)
was the largest previous study with a sample size of over 88 000 participants.11 Unexpectedly, this study reported a significant negative
association with DBP, which may be mainly driven by the Lifelines cohort, the largest and youngest cohort (mean age of 44 years) among
the three. When categorical noise levels and blood pressure associations were analysed by cohort, significant positive associations were
found in the >60 dB group vs. <_50 dB, for both SBP and DBP in
HUNT3, while in the EPIC-Oxford cohort, the association with SBP
was positive in the highest >65 dB group vs. <_55 dB. These findings,
however, should be interpreted with caution as the number of participants exposed to the highest noise group in each cohort was relatively small (N = 230 for HUNT3 and N = 580 for EPIC-Oxford).
Most of these previous studies analysed the relationship assuming a
linear relationship and some found that the relationship was not confounded by air pollution7,11 by analysing models without and with air
pollution adjustment.

Based on the largest study sample to date, in which over 30 000
participants were classified as highly exposed to residential road traffic noise (i.e. >65 dB), our study offers some new insights into this relationship. First, we found significant positive associations with both
SBP and DBP only among highly exposed participants, suggesting that
the relationship is likely non-linear. The restricted cubic spline analyses further revealed that the relationship only seems to be linear at
levels above 60 dB. Second, the positive effect estimates were significantly amplified upon inclusion of either NO2 or PM2.5 into the
model, suggesting that the effect estimates of road traffic noise on
both SBP and DBP may be underestimated without accounting for air
pollution effect, particularly that from near-road traffic as indicated
by NO2 in our analysis. It may be possible that NO2 mainly originates
from road traffic while PM2.5 could have many sources other than
road traffic, thereby contributing in part to a stronger confounding effect by NO2. NO2 could also be a proxy of ultrafine particles, a pollutant sharing very similar propagation behaviour to noise27 and was
recently linked to short-term adverse changes in blood pressure.28
As recently pointed out, it is still not completely clear whether traffic
noise and air pollution have differing, additive, synergistic and/or antagonistic effects on cardiovascular outcomes.2 Third, we tested different approaches to accounting for antihypertensive medication use
but the results remained robust.
The overall quality of evidence on the association between road
traffic noise and prevalent or incident hypertension is rated as very
low to low.4,5 We observed a null cross-sectional association with

self-reported hypertension in the UK Biobank cohort. This is consistent with two recent London-based studies on both prevalent or incident hypertension.10,29 The ESCAPE study found that the pooled
positive estimate, from six European cohorts, on incident selfreported hypertension was attenuated to null after adjusting for
PM2.5.30 More recently, a Danish study reported no association between road traffic noise exposure and prescriptions for hypertension
medication after a 14-year follow-up31 while a Ontario study found a
significant 2% increase in incident hypertension with a 15-year follow-up.32 The latter study was based on a health insurance database
covering over 700 000 participants with the assignment of noise estimates at postcode level and a lack of adjustment for lifestyle factors.
Despite we found a null association among all participants, our analyses did show that the associations with self-reported hypertension
tended to be positive and stronger among those who were currently
not using any antihypertensive medication and exposed to an Lden
level between 55 and 65 dB. This finding suggests that long-term exposure to moderate/high levels of road traffic noise may be harmful
on potentially uncontrolled hypertension.

In a recent analysis of the Lifelines cohort, a significant positive association was found with blood glucose but not glycated haemoglobin, independent of air pollution adjustment.14 While studies of road traffic
noise on blood glucose levels remain scarce, studies evaluating associations with diabetes generally reported an increased risk, for example a meta-analysis showed a 7% (95% CI 2%, 12%) increased risk
for every 5 dB higher road traffic noise exposure.33
We found opposite associations with triglycerides upon adjustment of NO2 or PM2.5. Two studies, of young34 or middle-aged35
adults, found that the estimated changes in triglycerides of long-term
exposure to NO2 were much higher as compared to PM2.5 while
studies on long-term traffic noise exposure remain few. In our previous work, the positive association with triglycerides no longer
remained significant after adjustment for NO2 or PM10 in the cohorts
of Lifelines and HUNT3.14 The relative importance of gaseous and
particulate pollutants on blood lipid profiles, and their respective
interactions with traffic noise, is unclear. Future experimental and epidemiological studies are warranted to investigate both traffic noise
and air pollution on lipid metabolism.
In a previous analysis of the Lifelines and HUNT3 cohorts, a positive association between long-term road traffic noise exposure and
CRP was observed; however, the estimate was slightly attenuated
but remained positive after controlling for air pollution.14 This is in
contrast with our findings of negative associations in air pollution-

Road traffic noise and cardiovascular disease risk factors

Role of body mass index
Notably, we observed stronger significant positive associations for all
five risk factors after un-adjusting for BMI. This raises the possibility
that BMI may be on the causal pathway on the investigated associations between traffic noise and cardiovascular health. A handful of
studies in Europe, including the UK Biobank study, have suggested a
positive association between long-term exposure to traffic noise and
adiposity markers.37 We suspect that BMI may likely serve as a mediator rather than a confounder in our investigated associations and
this speculation should necessitate a formal mediation analysis in future works. In particular, exploring the potential mediating role of the
so-called metabolically healthy obesity status in the associations between traffic noise and cardiovascular outcomes represents an important knowledge gap.

Mechanisms
The exact mechanisms between noise exposure and cardiovascular
health are not completely understood. The most frequently mentioned mechanism is that chronic exposure to noise leads to activation of the autonomic and endocrine systems, and a subsequent
cascade of stress hormones (i.e. catecholamines), which will be causing adverse changes in blood pressure, blood lipids and blood glucose.2 As discussed earlier, a novel pathway via adverse changes in
systemic inflammation or vascular inflammation only came to light recently38,39 (Graphical Abstract). A study recently reported that the
amygdala may be involved in processing the stress response via
heightened arterial inflammation.40 There may also exist a potential
social mechanism in light of some recent studies linking road traffic
noise41 or noise annoyance42 with reduced levels of physical activity,
the consequences of which may cause unfavourable changes in CVD
biochemistry profiles.

Strengths and limitations
The main strength of this study is the large study sample of >370 000
individuals in the main adjusted models, with detailed information on
a variety of demographic, lifestyle, individual, and area-level socioeconomic variables. The study has limitations. The cross-sectional study
design offers little support on causality and longitudinal studies are
needed to strengthen the findings. Residual confounding from diet,
physical activity, dyslipidaemia, family history, and other unmeasured
factors may potentially bias our results. Light exposure at night, for
which we did not have data, may potentially be another important
confounding factor as it has been associated with the progression of
carotid atherosclerosis43 and CVD hospitalization and death.44

..
Furthermore, as with all other studies of this type, exposure assign..
.. ment of road traffic noise bears some uncertainty as time spent out..
.. side of home, layout of rooms in the house, window opening habits,
.. noise sensitivity and indoor noise levels were not taken into account.
..
.. Such exposure misclassification may have diluted our observed asso.. ciations. Lnight exposure likely has reduced misclassification as most
..
.. people stay at home during night-time hours. However, our mod.. elled estimates from using categorical Lnight were similar as using Lden.
..
.. Our noise model at residential address did not specify a particular
.. facade point, and therefore, it is likely that our estimated effects may
..
.. have been underestimated. For instance, Foraster et al.7 estimated
.. that change in SBP was -0.20 mmHg (95% CI -1.25, 0.84) per 5 dB[A]
..
.. of outdoor road traffic Lnight. The estimate increased to 0.36 mmHg
..
.. (95% CI -0.06, 0.77) when outdoor road traffic Lnight at bedroom
.. facade was analysed and 0.72 mmHg (95% CI 0.29, 1.15) when indoor
..
.. road traffic Lnight in the bedroom was analysed. These findings high.. light the importance of applying facade modelling in estimating noise
..
.. exposures, which likely improves health effects estimation to a
.. greater accuracy. Another limitation of our noise model is that it
..
.. tended to over-estimate noise exposure at low levels due to the
.. assumed national traffic flow baseline value but to under-estimate ex..
.. posure for those heavily trafficked minor roads.2 Because of this, con.. tinuous noise estimates may be subject to more uncertainty and
..
.. therefore we opted for categorical noise analyses, which may have
.. relatively reduced misclassification.
..
..
The respective 0.77%, 0.49% and 0.79% increase in SBP, DBP and
.. triglycerides observed in the main model equates to an approximate
..
.. increase of 1.06 mmHg, 0.40 mmHg and 0.014 mmol/L for every
..
.. 10 dB higher of road traffic noise. These effect sizes are small and po.. tentially within the precision of instrumentation and random variation
..
.. for an individual. Measurements were only taken at baseline visit,
.. which did not truly reflect longer-term levels of these markers as
..
.. measurement errors and intra-individual biological variability over
.. time cannot be reliably accounted for without repeated measure..
.. ments. A recent report from UK Biobank showed consistent mean
.. values and a high self-correlation between baseline and repeated
..
.. measurements among 20 000 participants for blood lipids and gly.. cated haemoglobin.45 For an individual, clinical impact of such magni..
.. tude would be very small, if not negligible, despite statistical
.. significance. At the population level, this may be particularly alarming
..
.. given that currently across Europe 32 million people (nearly five mil..
.. lion in UK) are exposed to road traffic noise >65 dB.46
..
In conclusion, this study provides evidence of long-term exposure
..
to
road traffic noise over 65 dB and elevated levels of CVD risk fac..
.. tors, particularly SBP and DBP. Future research with the consider..
.. ation of both traffic noise and air pollution exposures is needed to
.. provide further clarification on the multiple mechanisms between
..
.. road traffic noise and CVD manifestation.

adjusted models. The inconsistency between the two studies may be
because our model had also adjusted for both BMI and area-level
socioeconomic status. Recently, the population-based SAPALDIA
cohort in Switzerland found significant enrichment of DNA methylation relating to CRP, independent of other noise sources and air pollution, with road Lden exposure.36 This is in line with findings from
novel experimental models, which found that traffic noise could induce oxidative stress and inflammation in the blood and the vasculature via an increased level of angiotensin II.1 More evidence is needed
to support this novel mechanism through systemic inflammation for
the association between traffic noise and health outcomes.
