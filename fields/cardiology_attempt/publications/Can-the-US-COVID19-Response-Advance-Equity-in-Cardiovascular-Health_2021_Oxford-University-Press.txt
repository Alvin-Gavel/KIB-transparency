The novel COVID-19 pandemic has caused more than 600 000
deaths in the USA and is disproportionately affecting racial and
ethnic groups and other vulnerable populations including the elderly and individuals with underlying medical comorbidities.
Compared with White adults, Black adults have a greater than
three-fold risk of dying from COVID-19 and Latinx adults a
nearly two-fold risk.1 These numbers mirror longstanding disparities in cardiovascular disease outcomes, where Black individuals
and communities have the highest rates of cardiovascular risk
factors and disease, as well as premature cardiovascular mortality.2 Disparities in health outcomes from COVID-19 and cardiovascular disease share many of the same root causes; and both
can be addressed through strong political action and focused
interventions.
In the USA, structural inequities-including bias and racism in societal laws and policies-cannot be disentangled from the social determinants known to disproportionately impact health outcomes in Black
and Latinx communities. Structural inequities have long resulted in
housing segregation and crowding; poor access to healthy foods, parks,
and recreation; low-quality healthcare; and exposure to daily stress
from discrimination, poverty, and a lack of safety. In the era of COVID19, structural inequities have translated into differences in infection
rates, severity, and outcomes, as well as access to COVID-19 testing,
telehealth visits, and vaccinations.
The new Administration has appropriately signalled the COVID-19
pandemic as its top health, economic and policy priority. If implemented
through a health equity lens, the response has the potential to not only
shape the course of the COVID-19 crisis but also catalyse a more equitable health system that results in improved cardiovascular outcomes.
In this viewpoint, we provide background to the main healthcare
themes the Biden-Harris Administration is focused on-insurance coverage, strengthening public health infrastructure, and modernization of
healthcare delivery-and highlight how specific attention to structural
and social inequities in healthcare could have a positive impact on both
the COVID-19 pandemic and cardiovascular health. While the US experience is unique, the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to test the
healthcare infrastructure in many countries and expose inequities in

health outcomes especially among vulnerable populations. Countries
can exchange best practices to address these health inequities and we
offer this perspective in that spirit.

Insurance coverage and financial
protection
The USA remains an outlier among high-income countries in that
healthcare is not recognized as a fundamental right. Approximately
10% of the US population <65 years is uninsured. Yet, in 2018, the
USA spent 16.9% of gross domestic product on health care, nearly
twice as much as the average country in the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
In 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
('Obamacare' or 'ACA') was passed with the goals of expanding insurance coverage, lowering healthcare costs, and improving individual and
population health. With its passage, insurance coverage expanded to
20 million more residents, pre-existing conditions are no longer a
determinant of insurance coverage and rates, and the nation's fee-forservice reimbursement system is slowly being transitioned to a valuebased one. Still, leading up to the COVID-19 pandemic, the US health
policy landscape was largely focused on the legality of the ACA, with
multiple attempts to overturn the law in the legislature and in the
courts.
With the unprecedented health consequences of COVID-19 coupled with historic job losses resulting in higher rates of uninsurance,
calls to overturn the law have quieted, and bolstering the ACA is becoming more feasible.3 The recently enacted COVID-19 pandemic relief bill includes provisions to expand insurance coverage and lower
costs for state-run health plans.4 To improve affordability, federal funds
will be used to increase tax credits to purchase health insurance and to
lower the cost of coverage as a percentage of family income. The current administration is also proposing a second bill that would potentially expand two federal insurance programmes-Medicare that
covers adults 65 years and older, and Medicaid that covers individuals
and families with limited or no income-which could prove to be

Restoration of trust and
investment in public health
infrastructure
The USA is grappling with waning trust in science and public health
institutions, stemming from several concurrent trends. The federal response to the COVID-19 pandemic under the prior Administration
lacked coordination, often failing to provide consistent, clear communication to the public.7 Experts within core agencies such as the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were not
empowered to lead public messaging on the pandemic, and these gaps
coincided with a growing epidemic of misinformation and disinformation about COVID-19. Moreover, during the last 4 years, the country
underfunded the areas of government vital to controlling a pandemic.
Between 2010 and 2019, the CDC budget dropped by 10%8 and of
the $3.36 trillion dollars spent on healthcare in 2018, only 3% went to
public health. For numerous populations, these realities exacerbated
existing legacies of distrust in the medical system.
The new Administration should focus intensely on rebuilding trust
in the public health system. Already, the Administration appointed the
nation's first Health Equity advisor in the White House, whose team
has started the process of bringing trust into the national discourse.
Vaccine messaging and community access tailored for populations of
colour are a priority. The new COVID-19 relief bill allocates billions of
dollars to vaccine awareness, distribution, and engagement, which will
hopefully achieve its intended impact. This focus could potentially have
repercussions for all of medicine. In the cardiovascular community,
multiple opportunities exist to invest in healthcare practices that build
trust, such as moving care closer to trusted community representatives. The LA Barbershop Study, in which hypertension was effectively
diagnosed and managed in barbershops, is one such example, yet its
scalability is hindered by the current healthcare reimbursement
structure.9

To advance equity, the Administration must act to fundamentally
change the structures and finances through which public health and
healthcare are administered, with a focus on vulnerable communities. Federal investments in public health infrastructure related to
the COVID-19 pandemic should be coupled with long term, sustained funding for prevention, and social determinants of health
that can impact all health outcomes. Reimbursement models that
incentivize health systems to establish care within their communities should be prioritized. Federal programmes to address hypertension in racial and ethnic communities hardest hit by the
pandemic could be part of a larger public health effort to improve
the lived environment (e.g. housing quality; access to parks and recreation centres; fresh vegetables in grocery stores).

Modernization of health delivery
COVID-19 has also highlighted the digital divide as a critical determinant of widening trends in cardiovascular outcomes by race and
economic status. Access to telehealth and remote patient monitoring have thrived in some segments of the population, but lagged
significantly for others. The Administration should bolster the funding of initiatives and passage of legislation to advance the accessibility and utility of digital health technologies.
During the pandemic, Medicare-the federal insurance programme for the elderly-rapidly expanded reimbursement for telehealth services, increasing uptake of these services nearly
overnight, but only among patients and providers with such capability. Medicare coverage for telephone visits is at a much lower
rate, and there is no support for infrastructure such as broadband internet or devices to support televideo visits. This has
resulted in unequal telehealth access in marginalized populations
at a time of critical need. Additionally, remote patient monitoring
devices, such as blood pressure cuffs that directly sync to the
medical record-and which are required for reimbursement,
remains limited, and again there is little support for populations
with low digital literacy. Given the consensus that telemedicine
and remote patient monitoring can enhance healthcare delivery,
we advocate action to support its use among all individuals and
communities.
Medicare and Medicaid could fund community health workers to
help low-income and elderly individuals engage with digital health
platforms while addressing other social determinants of health.10
Similarly, value-based care programmes could reward health systems that use digital health platforms to facilitate cardiovascular disease prevention and management of chronic disease (e.g. virtual
cardiac rehabilitation in patients at-risk for or with ischaemic heart
disease; decision support tools to optimize care management such
as guideline-concordant medical therapy in patients with heart failure). The new Administration recently signalled plans to invest in
broadband infrastructure across rural communities throughout the
USA. Such policies need to be coupled with initiatives to bring upto-date technology into the hands of end-users and research funding to support to evaluate strategies testing implementation and impact on positive health outcomes. Finally, the collection of realworld data could enhance care (e.g. patient-reported health status;
community data).

critical and viable pathways to universal coverage. Other key policy
measures like the creation of a public insurance option in the form of
Medicare for all Americans, lowering Medicare eligibility from age 65
to 60, and reducing drug prices by allowing Medicare to negotiate with
companies would also bolster coverage. While these policies are
more politically complex, and it is uncertain they would receive the
support needed to pass into law, they represent the type of transformative structural changes needed to advance equity in the US healthcare system.
Policies to expand insurance coverage and offer affordable health
coverage could improve cardiovascular outcomes. Cardiovascular
risk factors are highly prevalent in the uninsured population, but often go undetected and untreated until a major cardiovascular event
occurs. Among insured individuals, many patients forego medications and healthcare services, even following acute myocardial infarction,5 due to high out-of-pocket costs. For example, people with
cardiovascular disease spend 16% of their household income on
healthcare; 14% experience financial hardship; and 5% experience
catastrophic financial hardship.6 Financial toxicity in its many forms
has been associated with incident cardiovascular events and mortality. Affordable care is necessary to address these health inequities.

Conclusion
A robust US federal response to the COVID-19 pandemic can be harnessed to address the structural inequities that result in health outcome disparities. Strategic investments are needed to reduce financial
burdens on individuals, establish trust and fortify public health institutions and infrastructure, and modernize healthcare delivery using technology. Such actions will not only mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic
but could have lasting impact for advancing equitable cardiovascular
outcomes among diverse populations (Figure 1). The US experience
and response, while unique, could serve as an important example for
other nations wherein structural and social inequities are at the core
of poor health outcomes.
