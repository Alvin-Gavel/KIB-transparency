Aims

Operability of type A acute aortic dissections (TAAAD) is currently based on non-standardized decision-making
process, and it lacks a disease-specific risk evaluation model that can predict mortality. We investigated patient,
intraoperative data, surgeon, and centre-related variables for patients who underwent TAAAD in the UK.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
We identified 4203 patients undergoing TAAAD surgery in the UK (2009-18), who were enrolled into the UK National
Adult Cardiac Surgical Audit dataset. The primary outcome was operative mortality. A multivariable logistic regression anaand results
lysis was performed with fast backward elimination of variables and the bootstrap-based optimism-correction was adopted
to assess model performance. Variation related to hospital or surgeon effects were quantified by a generalized mixed linear
model and risk-adjusted funnel plots by displaying the individual standardized mortality ratio against expected deaths. Final
variables retained in the model were: age [odds ratio (OR) 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.03; P < 0.001]; malperfusion (OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.51-2.12; P < 0.001); left ventricular ejection fraction (moderate: OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.14-1.71;
P = 0.001; poor: OR 2.83, 95% CI 1.90-4.21; P < 0.001); previous cardiac surgery (OR 2.29, 95% CI 1.71-3.07; P < 0.001);
preoperative mechanical ventilation (OR 2.76, 95% CI 2.00-3.80; P < 0.001); preoperative resuscitation (OR 3.36, 95% CI
1.14-9.87; P = 0.028); and concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting (OR 2.29, 95% CI 1.86-2.83; P < 0.001). We found
a significant inverse relationship between surgeons but not centre annual volume with outcomes.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusions
Patient characteristics, intraoperative factors, cardiac centre, and high-volume surgeons are strong determinants of

outcomes following TAAAD surgery. These findings may help refining clinical decision-making, supporting patient
counselling and be used by policy makers for quality assurance and service provision improvement.

Introduction
Type A acute aortic dissection (TAAAD) is a life-threatening condition associated with the significant risk of mortality and morbidity. Mortality for TAAAD is 50% by 24 h and 50% of patients die
before reaching a specialist centre.1-5 Prompt surgical repair
remains the standard treatment for these patients. Improvement
in diagnostic techniques, initial management, and increased clinical
awareness6 over the last decade are expected to have increased
the number of patients promptly diagnosed and referred to surgery. However, survival after surgical repair is still suboptimal,
with high in-hospital mortality (16-18%).3,7-10 Controversy still
exists about which factors should be considered during the preoperative evaluation and decision-making process that can assess
risk and predict operative mortality. Moreover, the impact of different surgical strategies on outcomes remains unclear.10-12 The
impact of the centre or surgeon volume-outcome relationship on
mortality remains poorly understood. A better understanding of
outcome determinants in patients undergoing surgery could support decision-making, help when designing service provision, and
improve outcomes of the surviving patients that reach specialist
centres. Moreover, a precise risk stratification can provide better
patient counselling and be used for unit and surgeon benchmarking. In the present study, we aimed to investigate predictors of
outcome in patients undergoing surgery for TAAAD, including
clinical, perioperative, centre, and surgeon-level variables.

Outcomes
The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Other outcomes investigated were postoperative non-fatal cerebrovascular events, need for
postoperative dialysis, and re-exploration for bleeding.

Statistical analysis
Categorical variables were summarized as counts and percentages.
Continuous variables were summarized as median (interquartile range).
Patient's characteristics, operative data, and outcomes were presented in
the overall sample and stratified in three groups by the extent of surgical
repair: interposition graft, total aortic root replacement, and aortic arch
replacement (with or without aortic root replacement). Comparison of
variable distribution between groups was performed by means of v2 test
or Kruskal-Wallis test. To investigate determinants of survival, a stepwise
approach was adopted.

Analysis on risk factors
We performed a multivariate logistic regression analysis on in-hospital
mortality based on patient characteristics at presentation and surgical
data. Fast backward elimination on factors, using a method based on
Lawless and Singhal,14 was implemented. This method uses the fitted
complete model and computes approximate Wald statistics by computing conditional (restricted) maximum likelihood estimates assuming
multivariate normality of estimates. P-value was used as stopping rule and
a P-value of 0.05 was used as significance level for a variable to remain in
the final model (model 1). Bootstrap-based optimism-correction for the
new model was performed to allow estimation of the 'optimism' inherent
in a predictive accuracy measure derived from model training and testing
on the same sample (i.e. the apparent accuracy). This optimism is estimated by taking bootstrap samples from the full data, and for each sample, one carries out the same model development procedure applied to
the full data and then evaluates performance of the resulting model on
the bootstrap sample it was developed on, and also the full sample. The
difference between these performance estimates is then averaged over
bootstrap samples, to obtain an estimate of the optimism, which is then
subtracted from the apparent accuracy.
We also externally validated the risk model derived from the
International Registry of Aortic Dissection (IRAD).15 Discrimination, that
is the prediction model ability to distinguish between subjects developing
and not developing the outcome, was assessed using the area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). An AUC value of 0.5 indicates no discrimination ability, 0.7-0.8 indicates good discrimination

ability, 0.8-0.9 excellent discrimination ability, and 0.9 outstanding
performance.

Analysis of hospital and surgeon effect
Variation related to hospital or surgeon effect was quantified by generalized mixed linear model, which included the logit of predicted probabilities obtained from model 1, hospital and surgeon annual volume as fixed
terms, and individual hospital and surgeon as random effect. ANOVA for
nested model was used to investigate whether the inclusion of random
effects significantly improved overall model performance. We also tested
the effect of responsible anaesthetist as random effect. Non-linearity for
hospital and surgeon annual volume was tested using spline term. Best
cut-off points for annual volume were identified using Youden index
defined as [(sensitivity th specificity) - 1]. The maximum value of the
Youden index is 1 (perfect test) and the minimum is 0 when the test has
no diagnostic value. Moreover, to investigate whether variation in mortality can be attributed to individual hospital or surgeon performance, riskadjusted funnel plots were generated. Each hospital and surgeon were
then displayed as a scatter point showing the individual standardized mortality ratio (risk-adjusted) against expected deaths. Standardized ratio was
calculated as observed/predicted mortality rate where predicted mortality corresponded to individual risk probabilities obtained from model 1.
Upper and lower control limits calculated at 3d (corresponding to 99.8%
confidence intervals) from the mean, using the exact binomial method
described by Spiegelhalter.16 An upper warning limit (calculated similarly
to 95% confidence intervals) was also calculated at 2d from the mean.
Nonparametric dispersion test via mean deviance residual fitted vs.
simulated-refitted was used to assess overdispersion.

Results
A total of 4203 patients who underwent surgical repair for TAAAD
in 35 hospitals by 509 surgeons from 2009 to 2018 were identified
(median age 64 [52-73], 33.3% female). There was a steady increase
in the number of cases performed annually over the years as shown
in Figure 1. This corresponded to an increase in the mean number of
annual cases performed by each surgeon from 2.9 to 5.8. Most
patients received a hemiarch surgery (n = 1751, 41.7%), followed by
interposition graft (n = 1334, 31.7%), aortic root replacement
(n = 994, 23.6%), and only a small number of patients received total
arch replacement (n = 124, 3.0%) and this trend was constant over
time. Patient characteristics, operative data and outcomes in the
overall sample and according to the extent of surgical repair are presented in Table 1. Patients receiving aortic root replacement tended
to be younger and as expected and were more likely to have a previous diagnosis of Marfan syndrome. Patients undergoing total arch replacement were more likely to have previous cardiac surgery and
were operated on in hospitals and by surgeons with a higher annual
and overall volume.
The crude mortality rate was 17.8% with evidence of a steady decrease over the years (from 22.4% in 2009 to 15.5% in 2018) (Table 1
and Figure 1). Nine percentage of patients experienced non-fatal
stroke, and re-exploration and postoperative dialysis were required
in 11.9% and 14.7% of patients, respectively. Patients undergoing total
arch replacement showed a trend towards an increased crude incidence of mortality (22.6%), non-fatal stroke (14.5%), need for dialysis

Missing and conflicting data for in-hospital mortality are backfilled and validated via record linkage to the Office for National Statistics census database. The overall percentage of missing data for baseline information is
very low (1.7%). Missing categorical or dichotomous variable data were
imputed with the mode while missing continuous variables data were
imputed with the median. For the present analysis, from the NACSA
registry, we identified patients undergoing surgery for TAAAD from
January 2009 to December 2018 in England, Scotland, and Wales. All procedures included in the present analysis were classified under the heading
of urgent (non-elective admission with need for surgery during the same
admission), emergency (operation before the next working day), or salvage (patients needing cardiopulmonary resuscitation on route to theatre
or before anaesthesia induction). We calculated the annual and total
number of cases (volume) performed by responsible surgeon and cardiac
centre.

anaesthetist-level effect including annual case volume. We found an
increase in the number of total procedures and annual number of
procedures performed per surgeon. Most cases were treated with
hemiarch or limited replacement of the ascending aorta (interposition graft), this was followed by replacement of the aortic root and
only a small proportion of patients undergoing total aortic arch replacement. The overall raw mortality rate was 18% with a decrease
over time from 22% in 2009 to 15% in 2018. We identified seven independent risk factors associated with mortality: age, malperfusion,
previous heart surgery, reduced left ventricular systolic function, preoperative ventilation, preoperative resuscitation, and concomitant
coronary artery bypass graft surgery, which were used to build a bedside risk scoring tool, the UK aortic score (Graphical Abstract). This
score was developed on the largest series of TAAAD surgical repairs
ever reported.15,17,18
We also investigated whether there was any evidence of cardiac
surgery centre and operating surgeon volume-outcome relationship
and whether the effect on mortality has a volume-outcome relationship. We found that individual centre and surgeon showed an effect
on mortality, which was independent of volume, with a larger effect
related to individual surgeon and no effect related to the responsible
anaesthetist. Only operating surgeon volume was associated with a
lower risk of mortality, with 5 being the minimum number of
TAAAD repairs per surgeon per year required to minimize the risk
of mortality.
The results reported here are consistent with those reported in
other national and international registries. The IRAD registry collected information on 2952 patients with type A aortic dissection
from 28 referral centres from North America, Europe, Asia, and
Australia and reported an operative mortality of 18%.3 The German
Registry for Acute Aortic Dissection Type A (GERAADA) collected
information on 2137 patients undergoing surgery for TAAAD in 50
centres in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and Luxembourg from July
2006 to June 20107 and reported an overall mortality of 17%. Similar
mortality rates (16%) were reported by the Nordic Consortium for
Acute Type A Aortic Dissection (NORCAAD), a collaborative

To the best of our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive analysis on determinants of outcomes after surgical repair for TAAAD. It
is based on a decade (2009-18) of surgery and data collection into a
recognized nationwide dataset. Our analysis focused on patient characteristics, surgical strategies, and hospital-, surgeon-, and

the current UK policy regarding systematic public reporting of operative outcomes of individual surgeons may generate risk averse behaviours characterized by refraining from performing high-risk
procedures potentially associated with worse in-hospital outcomes,
such as aortic arch replacement in the setting of TAAAD.22
Total root replacement was performed in 24% of patients in our
study with no impact on the observed mortality. Despite the anticipated increased technical complexity of aortic root surgery in the
setting of TAAAD, other large series have also reported equivalent
operative mortality, with a lower incidence of aortic root reoperation.3,7,23 It can therefore be recommended that total aortic root replacement should be considered when indicated (e.g. extensive root
destruction, concomitant root aneurysm, bicuspid aortopathy, or history of connective tissue disease).24,25
Reports from other registries have found that it is the anatomical
extension of the tear and not the extension of surgical repair that has
an effect on patient outcome.7 This, however, could be explained by
inherited bias related to the fact that surgeons may decide upon a limited procedure in sick and/or elderly patients vs. a more extensive repair in lower risk and/or younger patients. Moreover, there is no
agreement on which features should be considered when we want to
account for the extension of the disease (e.g. entry point vs. size vs.
extension of the dissection) and this could also contribute to the
reported differences in practices and outcomes.
In the present analysis, the cerebral perfusion strategy per se was
not identified as an independent risk factor for mortality and no difference in postoperative mortality was found in patients with and
without cerebral perfusion undergoing hemiarch and arch replacement surgery. Other registries of unselected patients (e.g. STS and
GERAADA) have found no association between cerebral perfusion
strategies and outcomes.7,19 Various biases are likely to balance outcome and lead to this observation. For instance, cerebral perfusion
could be used in patients requiring more extensive repair and longer
circulatory arrest time as in patients undergoing arch replacement.
The choice of neuroprotective strategies is mainly tailored on surgeon's experience and skillset, patient characteristics, and extent of
surgical resection. The benefit of cerebral perfusion becomes apparent when the analysis is focused on patients requiring complex procedures, with longer circulatory arrest time (>30 min).9,26-28
Our analysis confirmed a strong inverse relationship between
adjusted mortality and surgeon annual case volume. As the annual
number of cases per surgeon has increased, these results suggest that
the observed reduction in in-hospital mortality in the most recent
years can be partially due to the volume-outcome effect. We found
evidence that a minimum of 5 cases per year per surgeon should be
sought to improve outcomes. However, our mixed model showed
that annual surgeon volume of TAAAD repairs does not fully account
for the relationship between individual surgeon and mortality. The
surgeon effect remained significant after adjusting for the surgeon annual volume, thus suggesting that other unmeasured factors could
have contributed to the observed differences in outcomes. For instance, inadvertent aortic sub-specialization of those surgeons performing a high volume of elective aortic procedures will allow them
to develop and improve the skillset and expertise useful in the context of emergency aortic cases. Moreover, this finding highlights the
need for surgical training programs to educate and expose the new

registry of eight academic cardiothoracic centres in Denmark,
Finland, Iceland, and Sweden.8 A retrospective analysis of 6387
patients from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) database
(2014-18) reported an overall mortality of 16.5%.9 Notably, the
mean age was similar across these registries (60-62 years) and the
risk factors included in our model were consistent with those
reported in other registries including co-existing comorbidities (e.g.
advanced age) and critical conditions at presentation (e.g. mechanical
ventilation, malperfusion).7,15,17,19 The definition of malperfusion is
variable across the different registries. In our study, we classified malperfusion as the resultant of patients presenting with coronary malperfusion, renal malperfusion, cardiogenic shock (cardiac tamponade,
low cardiac output), cerebral perfusion (cerebrovascular accidents in
the previous 24 h), and any pulse deficit/limb ischaemia. The reported
rate was similar to that reported in the GERAADA database7 and
higher than that reported in the NORCAAD registry.8
Similar to previous reports, we found that complete resection of
the intimal tear and prosthetic replacement of the ascending aorta
(with or without hemiarch) are still the most commonly performed
procedures for type A aortic dissections.3,7-9 In this study, the extension of surgical repair (ascending aorta, hemiarch, total arch replacement) was usually based on the surgical assessment of the aortic
pathology and, therefore, surgical repair was aimed at the excision of
the dissection entry tear. An entry tear involving the small curvature
of the aortic arch was addressed by confectioning an interposition
graft with hemiarch. A more extensive arch operation was dictated
by the presence of the entry tear near the supra-aortic branches or
was based on the surgeon's 'judgement call', after considering patient
preoperative conditions, severity of aortic arch involvement and individual surgeon expertise. In recent years, the evolution of subspecialty aortic services and the introduction of new technology with
refinements in surgical techniques and cerebral protection have led
to extensive surgery for TAAAD that involves aortic arch replacement with possible extensions into the proximal descending aorta
along with hybrid, staged procedures.20 Extending the first operation
for TAAAD to treating the dissected aortas to a greater extent will
decrease the risks of progressive aortic dilation and rupture of the residual dissected aorta and offer significant advantage to second stage
intravascular treatment options. However, this medium to long term
expected benefit from more extensive repairs needs to be weighed
against a potential higher mortality and morbidity from the increased
complexity of the initial procedure. The present analysis showed that
patients who underwent total aortic arch replacement were more
likely to experience a fatal event. While total arch replacement has
been consistently shown to be safe in elective surgery, controversy
still exists about its impact on surgical mortality and morbidity and its
long-term benefit in the setting of TAAAD.21 Our results confirm the
hypothesis that total aortic arch replacement should be undertaken
on the basis of the patient preoperative conditions and surgical findings. Compared to other registries, our cohort showed a lower proportion of patients undergoing total arch replacement and this could
be attributed to the fact that only few units in the UK currently have
a dedicated aortic service delivered by specialist aortic surgeons. As
such, most of the operating surgeons may prefer to perform less
complex procedures [e.g. interposition graft (+/- hemiarch)] instead of
more technically demanding repairs, whenever possible. Moreover,

52

Limitations
The reported results are limited by information registered within the
database that has been interrogated. Important operative details that
might influence patient outcome, such as cannulation sites, cross
clamp vs. open distal anastomosis or core temperature, were not
recorded. Also, concomitant coronary artery bypass graft surgery
included cases where coronary artery involvement was evident at
computed tomography, but we were not able to determine whether
it was a planned or bail-out intraoperative strategy.
Another limitation is that we do not yet have access to longerterm follow-up data. There is a lack of information about preoperative patient selection, as patients who were not offered surgery were
not included in the registry. Finally, the UK aortic score will need external validation in case series from other countries before it can be
adopted outside the UK.

Conclusions
Patient characteristics, intraoperative factors, cardiac centre, and
high-volume surgeons are strong determinants of outcomes following TAAAD surgery. These results can help refining clinical decisionmaking, supporting patient counselling, and can be used by policy
makers for service provision improvement.

generations of surgeons to dissection cases due to the importance of
surgeon skills in improving outcomes of this dire surgical disease.
The initial correlation between centre volume of operated
TAAAD and mortality was no longer significant when the model
accounted for the effect related to individual surgeons. This suggests
that factors other than centre volume itself may explain the variability
observed across different centres (i.e. dedicated aortic service,
streamlined perioperative care), including regional differences
regarding referral pathways and networking. Highly efficient referral
pathways have been proven to influence better outcomes by reducing waiting at peripheral hospitals and transfer times.29 The presence
of specialized aortic services able to provide 24/7 access for patients
presenting with TAAAD represents a relevant factor for the improvement of outcomes in these cases by optimizing the referral
pathway and allowing referring centres to have a direct contact with
the aortic team.30
Finally, we did not find a significant effect of the responsible anaesthetic on outcomes, although it is plausible that the quality of intensive care may still play an important role in determining patient
outcomes.
Given the relatively small number of patients with TAAAD
referred to surgery every year, most UK cardiac centres are unlikely
to build adequate expertise to optimize surgical outcomes. In light of
the relevant effect related to individual surgeon and institution on
outcomes and the rapid access in most urban centres to surgical
teams with focused expertise in the management of aortic dissection,
it may no longer be appropriate to give priority to rapid surgical
transfer over transfer to an experienced centre. With improvements
in diagnostic times and early medical management, access to teams
with subspecialty interest in aortic surgery can further reduce operative mortality.
