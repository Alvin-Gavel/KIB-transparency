Aims

Whilst the risk factors for type 1 myocardial infarction due to atherosclerotic plaque rupture and thrombosis are
established, our understanding of the factors that predispose to type 2 myocardial infarction during acute illness is
still emerging. Our aim was to evaluate and compare the risk factors for type 1 and type 2 myocardial infarction.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
We conducted a secondary analysis of a multi-centre randomized trial population of 48 282 consecutive patients
attending hospital with suspected acute coronary syndrome. The diagnosis of myocardial infarction during the index
and results
presentation and all subsequent reattendances was adjudicated according to the Universal Definition of Myocardial
Infarction. Cox regression was used to identify predictors of future type 1 and type 2 myocardial infarction during
a 1-year follow-up period. Within 1 year, 1331 patients had a subsequent myocardial infarction, with 924 and 407
adjudicated as type 1 and type 2 myocardial infarction, respectively. Risk factors for type 1 and type 2 myocardial
infarction were similar, with age, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes, abnormal renal function, and known coronary disease
predictors for both (P < 0.05 for all). Whilst women accounted for a greater proportion of patients with type 2 as
compared to type 1 myocardial infarction, after adjustment for other risk factors, sex was not a predictor of type 2
myocardial events [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66-1.01]. The strongest predictor of type 2 myocardial infarction was a prior history of type 2 events (aHR 6.18, 95% CI 4.70-8.12).

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusions
Risk factors for coronary disease that are associated with type 1 myocardial infarction are also important predictors of type 2 events during acute illness. Treatment of these risk factors may reduce future risk of both type 1
and type 2 myocardial infarction.

Methods
Study population
Between June 2013 and March 2016, a total of 48 282 consecutive
patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome who attended one of
the 10 secondary and tertiary care hospitals in Scotland were enrolled in
the High-Sensitivity Troponin in the Evaluation of patients with Acute
Coronary Syndrome (High-STEACS) trial.15 All patients attending the
emergency department were screened for suspected acute coronary
syndrome by the attending clinician. To avoid selection bias and ensure a
representative population we used an enrolment tool embedded into the
electronic health care system. Patients were eligible for inclusion if they
presented with suspected acute coronary syndrome and had cardiac
troponin measured using a high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I assay (hscTnI; ARCHITECTSTAT high-sensitive troponin I assay; Abbott Park, IL,
USA). This assay has an inter-assay coefficient of variation of <10% at
4.7 ng/L, the limit of detection of 1.2 and 1.9 ng/L, and a sex-specific 99th
centile thresholds of 16 and 34 ng/L for women and men, respectively.16,17 Standardized practice guidelines were in place across all recruiting
centres during study enrolment. In accordance with guidelines, myocardial infarction was ruled out when cardiac troponin concentrations were
<99th percentile at presentation if symptom onset was >6 h from presentation or after serial testing 6-12 h from symptom onset in those presenting earlier.18,19 Patients were excluded if they were not resident in
Scotland or had been enrolled in the trial previously. Following discharge,
all patients who reattended with suspected acute coronary syndrome
were identified using the same electronic screening tool.15 We used regional and national registries to ensure complete follow-up for the study
population over a 1-year period from the date of the index admission.

oxygen supply and demand imbalance in the context of an acute illness causing tachyarrhythmia, hypoxia, or hypotension without acute
atherothrombosis.
The risk factors for type 1 myocardial infarction have been well
characterized in a number of large trials.4,5 Pre-existing conditions
such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidaemia have
been shown to increase future atherothrombotic risk. Risk factors
that predict type 2 myocardial infarction are likely to be more complex, with an acute illness responsible for supply or demand imbalance and myocardial infarction in a population of susceptible patients.
Supply or demand imbalance itself is often multifactorial and may
arise from any acute process leading to sustained tachycardia, hypoxia, or hypotension. However, type 2 myocardial infarction is not
ubiquitous during acute illness, and some patients may tolerate significant haemodynamic stress without cardiac consequence (Graphical
Abstract).
Our knowledge of the risk factors and patient characteristics that
predispose to type 2 myocardial infarction during acute illness is limited.6-11 Meanwhile, clinical outcomes after type 2 myocardial infarction remain poor, with as many as two-third of patients dying within
5 years.7,9,12-14 A greater understanding of risk factors for type 2
myocardial infarction could facilitate targeted intervention and perhaps reduce the long-term risk of future events in this population.
Here, we evaluate the predictors of future type 1 and type 2 myocardial infarction events during 1-year follow-up of a population of consecutive patients who attended hospital with suspected acute
coronary syndrome.

Results
In 48 282 patients with 1 year of follow-up, 2839 patients reattended
the emergency department with suspected acute coronary syndrome and were found to have a hs-cTnI concentration above the
99th centile. It was possible to adjudicate the index and subsequent
diagnosis in 88% and 92% of patients, respectively, with moderate
agreement between adjudicators for the index (Cohen's kappa coefficient, K = 0.8) and subsequent diagnoses (K = 0.7). During follow-up,
there were 924 patients with an adjudicated diagnosis of type 1 myocardial infarction, 407 with type 2 myocardial infarction, and 1169
and 77 patients adjudicated as acute or chronic myocardial injury,
respectively.
Patients with either type 1 or type 2 myocardial infarction had a
similar prevalence of known coronary disease (56% vs. 58%), cerebrovascular disease (12% vs. 13%), hyperlipidaemia (63% vs. 67%),
and diabetes mellitus (22% vs. 21%) (Table 1). However, compared
to those with type 1 myocardial infarction, those with type 2 myocardial infarction were marginally older [median age 77 (IQR 69-83) vs.
74 (IQR 62-83)] and were more likely to have abnormal renal function (44% vs. 39%).

It was possible to determine the cause of subsequent type 2 myocardial infarction in 98% (397/407) of patients. Tachyarrhythmia
(50%), hypoxia (22%), hypotension (12%), and anaemia (11%) were
the most common causes, with coronary causes (<2%) and hypertension (2%) less frequent (Supplementary material online, Figure S1
and Table S1). There was no difference in age, sex, prior history of
coronary disease, cerebrovascular disease, hyperlipidaemia, or diabetes mellitus between different causes of type 2 myocardial infarction (Supplementary material online, Table S2).
In a multivariable model, the factors associated with increased susceptibility for future type 1 or type 2 myocardial infarction were similar (Figure 1). Risk factors for type 1 myocardial infarction were
increased age (aHR 1.34, 95% CI 1.28-1.42) and a prior history of
coronary artery disease (aHR 1.13, 95% CI 1.10-1.16), diabetes mellitus (aHR 1.36, 95% CI 1.14-1.61), or increased creatinine concentration (aHR 1.49, 95% 1.26-1.76 per log increase) (Figure 1). Similarly,
type 2 myocardial infarction was more likely in those with increased
age (aHR 1.52, 95% CI 1.40-1.65), or a prior history of coronary artery disease (aHR 1.11, 95% CI 1.07-1.16), hyperlipidaemia (aHR
1.27, 95% CI 1.01-1.61), diabetes mellitus (aHR 1.46, 95% CI 1.12-
1.90), or increased creatinine concentration (aHR 1.40, 95% CI 1.08-

1.82 per log increase). Sex was not a significant predictor of type 1
(aHR 1.08, 95% CI 0.94-1.24) or type 2 (aHR 0.82, 95% CI 0.66-
1.01) myocardial infarction.
A prior diagnosis of type 1 or type 2 myocardial infarction was the
strongest predictor of future type 1 or type 2 events, respectively.
Patients with a prior type 1 myocardial infarction had the highest risk
of a future type 1 myocardial infarction event (aHR 5.80, 95% CI
5.06-6.65) with a subsequent type 1 event occurring in 8% (409/
4981) of those with a prior type 1 myocardial infarction, as compared
to 3% (39/1121) of those with a prior type 2 event (Figure 2).
Similarly, patients with a prior type 2 myocardial infarction were at
increased risk of a future type 2 event (aHR 6.18, 95% CI 4.70-8.12).
Future type 2 events occurred in 7% (75/1121) of patients with a
prior type 2 event, as compared to 2% (83/4981) of those with a
prior type 1 myocardial infarction (Figure 2).
Patients with a future type 1 or 2 myocardial infarction during
follow-up were on similar preventative medication including aspirin

Discussion
In 48 282 patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome, we
determined the risk factors associated with development of future
type 1 or type 2 myocardial infarction. We report several observations that are informative for clinical practice. We observed that risk
factors traditionally associated with type 1 myocardial infarction,
including diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidaemia, abnormal renal function,
and a prior history of coronary artery disease, were also important
predictors of type 2 myocardial infarction. Whilst all patients with a

prior history of myocardial infarction were at increased risk of recurrent events, patients with a previous type 2 myocardial infarction
were six times more likely to have a subsequent type 2 event. The
similar cardiovascular risk factor profile of patients with future type 1
or type 2 myocardial infarction suggests that shared underlying
pathophysiological mechanisms may increase the susceptibility for
type 2 myocardial infarction. Identifying and targeting these risk factors in patients with type 2 myocardial infarction, for example,
through optimizing glycaemic control, blood pressure, lipid levels,
and ensuring those with underlying coronary disease are on optimal
secondary prevention, could reduce the risk of future events.
The risk factors for type 1 myocardial infarction were established
in a number of large studies predating the introduction of highsensitivity cardiac troponin and the Universal Definition of
Myocardial Infarction.4,5 In these studies, enrolment was either selective or restricted to patients in coronary care units, and those with
significant comorbidities were excluded. This resulted in preferential
recruitment of those with atherothrombotic type 1 myocardial infarction. Pre-existing conditions such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidaemia increase the risk of type 1 myocardial
infarction, and the modification of these risk factors through lifestyle
intervention and pharmacotherapy has been shown to reduce future
type 1 myocardial infarction events and improve survival.5,22
In contrast, knowledge of the factors that predispose to type 2
myocardial infarction is still emerging. A number of cross-sectional
studies have compared the characteristics of patients classified with
either type 1 or type 2 myocardial infarction,6-11,23 but to date there
have been no prospective studies evaluating the risk factors for future
type 1 or type 2 myocardial infarction events during follow-up.
Unlike type 1 myocardial infarction, which is caused by atherothrombotic plaque rupture, type 2 myocardial infarction has a more diverse
and complex aetiology. Our findings are consistent with those of
Saaby et al.24 who demonstrated that patients with type 2 myocardial

infarction most commonly presented with tachyarrhythmia (29%),
anaemia (21%), hypoxia (21%), or hypotension (6%).
Although the underlying conditions responsible for myocardial
oxygen supply or demand imbalance are heterogeneous, our analysis
is the first to demonstrate that a number of common cardiovascular
risk factors are associated with susceptibility to type 2 myocardial infarction. We demonstrate that several risk factors usually associated
with coronary disease and atherothrombotic type 1 myocardial infarction, including hyperlipidaemia, diabetes mellitus, and a prior history of coronary artery disease, are also important predictors of
future type 2 myocardial infarction (Figure 1). Our findings are consistent with prior studies of consecutive patients with myocardial infarction where investigators demonstrated that >50% of patients
undergoing coronary angiography had evidence of obstructive coronary disease.24,25 Whilst a number of studies have reported that coronary artery disease and its risk factors are common in patients
presenting with type 2 myocardial infarction,26,27 only one previous
study has prospectively evaluated the link with future type 2 events.
CASABLANCA is a prospective cohort study that enrolled patients
who underwent peripheral or coronary angiography and were followed up for incident myocardial infarction events. This demonstrated that patients with future type 2 myocardial infarction were
more likely to have multivessel obstructive disease at baseline, compared to those without a future type 2 myocardial infarction event
(47.7% vs. 35.3%).12
Our observation that traditional cardiovascular risk factors were
common and shared predictors of future type 1 or type 2 myocardial
infarction suggests that the presence of coronary artery disease, or
risk factors for the progression of atherosclerosis, confers increased
susceptibility to type 2 events. Whilst the risk of supply or demand
imbalance leading to type 2 myocardial infarction is primarily driven
by the severity of acute physiological stress, the threshold at which ischaemia occurs may be related to the extent of flow limitation from

effectiveness in dedicated trials of carefully selected patients with
type 2 myocardial infarction.
Our observation that type 2 myocardial infarction begets type 2
myocardial infarction could be a consequence of the lower rates of
coronary angiography, revascularization, and pharmacotherapy prescriptions in these patients.29 Failure to identify and treat important
coronary disease in patients with type 2 myocardial infarction could
result in progressive worsening of ischaemic burden and increased
risk of recurrent infarction during future acute illness. It is therefore
plausible that wider use of both invasive and non-invasive coronary
imaging could facilitate improved identification of coronary disease
and help target treatments designed to improve outcomes and reduce the risk of future events in patients with type 2 myocardial infarction. The Appropriateness of Coronary Investigation in
Myocardial Injury and Type 2 Myocardial Infarction (ACT-2) randomized controlled trial will assess whether computed tomography or invasive coronary angiography might improve the prescription of
secondary prevention therapy and impact on future cardiovascular
outcomes.33
In our study, we also evaluated whether sex was associated with
the risk of myocardial infarction. Male sex is an established risk factor
for type 1 myocardial infarction,34 but the role of sex in type 2 myocardial infarction is unclear. Consistent with previous studies, we
observed that, when compared to type 1 myocardial infarction,
women account for a higher proportion of patients with type 2
events.6-11,24,35,36 However, when adjusting for cardiovascular risk
factors and comorbidities, sex was not an important predictor of
type 2 myocardial infarction. This observation may not be entirely
surprising given the acute triggers for type 2 events, such as tachycardia, hypoxia, and hypotension, are perhaps less likely to be influenced
by patient sex. Although this observation contrasts the findings of
Neumann et al.11 who reported in a cross-sectional analysis that female sex was associated with type 2 myocardial infarction, data from
the CASABLANCA study, which is the only other prospective evaluation of risk factors for type 2 myocardial infarction, support our conclusion that coronary disease risk factors, rather than patient sex, are
more important determinants of type 2 myocardial infarction.12
Our study has several limitations. First, we recognize that our
study population is limited to patients attending a secondary or tertiary care hospital with suspected acute coronary syndrome, and the
prevalence of subsequent myocardial infarction is therefore higher
than would be anticipated in the general population. As the incidence
of type 2 myocardial infarction in the general population is low, we
conducted this analysis in a higher-risk population to enable a fully
adjusted multivariable analysis. Nevertheless, we believe that our
population is relevant to address this question since all patients
enrolled in our study were hospitalized for an acute illness, which is a
prerequisite for type 2 myocardial infarction. Second, we did not
have access to information on all cardiovascular risk factors, notably
smoking status, and hypertension, nor did we have access to lipid
profiles or blood pressure readings to evaluate the role of risk prediction tools such as the Framingham risk score. Further studies in a
population undergoing screening for cardiovascular risk factors are
needed to confirm our findings. Third, although all diagnoses in
patients with troponin concentrations above the 99th centile were
adjudicated according to the Universal Definition, there was moderate agreement between adjudicators (K = 0.7-0.8) and potential for

atherosclerotic coronary disease. In contrast to a patient with obstructive coronary artery disease and attenuated flow reserve, a patient with no coronary disease may have a higher ischaemic
threshold, and a similar physiological stress may not lead to cardiac
consequences.28 This underlines the importance of considering the
magnitude of supply or demand imbalance and probability of coronary artery disease relative to each individual patient (Graphical
Abstract). Furthermore, coronary artery disease in those with type 2
myocardial infarction could explain why the incidence of future cardiac death is broadly comparable to patients with type 1 events.7,10
This raises the possibility that therapies and interventions to reduce
the burden of coronary disease, including coronary revascularization,
could modify the risk of myocardial ischaemia and play an important
role in reducing the risk of type 2 myocardial infarction and adverse
outcomes.
Currently, there is no consensus on how patients with type 2 myocardial infarction should be managed. In contrast to type 1 myocardial
infarction where 60% patients undergo coronary angiography and
80% are prescribed preventative pharmacotherapies at discharge, in
those with type 2 myocardial infarction, <20% of patients undergo
coronary angiography and >40% are discharged without antiplatelet
or lipid-lowering therapies.23,29 In the present study, we observed
that the majority of patients hospitalized for type 2 myocardial infarction were already established on cardioprotective pharmacotherapies. This is not overly surprising given a previous myocardial
infarction was the most important predictor of future events during
follow-up. It is likely that the proportion of patients with type 2 myocardial infarction already established on preventative therapies would
be much lower in the general population as has been observed in
prior studies.8,9,29
Whether the systematic use of preventative therapies or treatments for coronary artery disease, or its risk factors, can reduce the
risk of type 2 myocardial infarction is uncertain. Indeed, widespread
use of antiplatelet medication could be harmful in type 2 myocardial
infarction, including, for example, where acute supply or demand imbalance has been triggered by bleeding.30 Careful selection of patients
with type 2 myocardial infarction for any therapies should be undertaken after recovery from acute illness. The use of registry and cohort studies to evaluate this question is inherently challenging with
significant confounding by indication, and dedicated randomized controlled trials of drug therapies in selected patients with type 2 myocardial infarction are needed.
Despite the paucity of trials in type 2 myocardial infarction, exploratory analyses from trials in other populations have shown that
the treatment of risk factors for coronary artery disease may reduce
the risk of type 2 myocardial infarction. The ODYSSEY OUTCOMES
trial recently observed that alirocumab, a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor used in the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia, could reduce both future type 1 and type 2 myocardial
infarction by 13% and 22%, respectively, as compared to placebo.31
Furthermore, in the DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial, dapagliflozin, an
sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor, reduced future type 1 and
type 2 myocardial infarction in patients with a history of myocardial
infarction and type 2 diabetes mellitus.32 These observations suggest
that interventions that reduce cardiovascular risk through multiple
mechanisms, including reducing the burden of hypercholesterolaemia
or optimizing management of diabetes, should be evaluated for their

diagnostic misclassification, especially in patients without serial troponin testing. Finally, our study was limited to a single healthcare system,
and the prevalence of type 2 myocardial infarction is highly dependent on the approach to patient selection for troponin testing.37 As
such, validation of our results in other healthcare settings is needed
to confirm the generalizability of our findings.
