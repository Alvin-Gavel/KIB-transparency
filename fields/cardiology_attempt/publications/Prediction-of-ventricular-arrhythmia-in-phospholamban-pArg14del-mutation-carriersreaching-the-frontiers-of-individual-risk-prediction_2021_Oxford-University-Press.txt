Aims

This study aims to improve risk stratification for primary prevention implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implantation by developing a new mutation-specific prediction model for malignant ventricular arrhythmia (VA) in phospholamban (PLN) p.Arg14del mutation carriers. The proposed model is compared to an existing PLN risk model.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
Data were collected from PLN p.Arg14del mutation carriers with no history of malignant VA at baseline, identified
and results
between 2009 and 2020. Malignant VA was defined as sustained VA, appropriate ICD intervention, or (aborted)

sudden cardiac death. A prediction model was developed using Cox regression. The study cohort consisted of 679
PLN p.Arg14del mutation carriers, with a minority of index patients (17%) and male sex (43%), and a median age of
42 years [interquartile range (IQR) 27-55]. During a median follow-up of 4.3 years (IQR 1.7-7.4), 72 (10.6%) carriers experienced malignant VA. Significant predictors were left ventricular ejection fraction, premature ventricular
contraction count/24 h, amount of negative T waves, and presence of low-voltage electrocardiogram. The multivariable model had an excellent discriminative ability fC-statistic 0.83 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78-0.88]g.
Applying the existing PLN risk model to the complete cohort yielded a C-statistic of 0.68 (95% CI 0.61-0.75).

Ventricular arrhythmia in PLN p.Arg14del carriers

Conclusion

This new mutation-specific prediction model for individual VA risk in PLN p.Arg14del mutation carriers is superior
to the existing PLN risk model, suggesting that risk prediction using mutation-specific phenotypic features can
improve accuracy compared to a more generic approach.

Cardiomyopathy

Introduction
Hereditary cardiomyopathies are a leading cause of sudden cardiac
death (SCD) in young adults.1 In the past years, substantial progress
has been made in elucidating the genetic variants that contribute to
the development of cardiomyopathy. Predominantly, alterations in
genes coding for cytoskeletal, sarcomeric, desmosomal, and Z-disk
proteins were found to be associated with the development of cardiomyopathy. Furthermore, variants in genes encoding calcium modulators are known to be associated with cardiomyopathies,2 including
the gene encoding phospholamban (PLN), a protein essential for calcium homeostasis. Multiple pathogenic PLN variants are associated

with the development of cardiomyopathy.3-8 The pathogenic variant
in PLN, which has been studied most extensively, is c.4042delAGA;p.Arg14del,9 which leads to a deletion of arginine 14 in
the coding region of PLN and is associated with both dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC).10 This variant has been found in several European
countries, the USA, Canada, and China11-13 and is one of the most
prevalent single cardiomyopathy-related gene alterations in the
world, in particular in the Netherlands.14 The p.Arg14del variant in
PLN is characterized by a low-voltage electrocardiogram (ECG),
repolarization abnormalities, development of cardiomyopathy, endstage heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias (VA), and premature

Malignant VA risk prediction in PLN p.Arg14del carriers. With the mutation specific risk factors low and high risk groups can be identified. PLN,
Phospholamban; VA, Ventricular arrhythmia.

Methods
Study design
The prediction model was developed using data from a retrospective
multicentre longitudinal cohort study and reported according to the
TRIPOD statement.17 The study conformed to the principles of the
Helsinki declaration. Design of the registry and collected variables were
published earlier.18

Study population
The study cohort consists of index patients and relatives in whom the
pathogenic p.Arg14del variant was identified for diagnostic purposes or
cascade screening after genetic counselling in three Dutch University
Hospitals and one Spanish University Hospital, between 2009 and May
2020. Genetic analysis of PLN was performed in index patients with clinical characteristics and family history or area of birth suggestive for a pathogenic PLN variant. Genetic analysis and counselling were also offered to
relatives who were at risk of being p.Arg14del mutation carriers.

Data collection
All data were collected via chart review from first clinical contact to last
follow-up with a cardiologist or clinical geneticist. All data were entered
in electronic case report forms in compliance with good clinical practice.
Follow-up was performed in both university and non-university hospitals.
Baseline was defined as first-ever clinical contact and follow-up ended at
the last available cardiology department visit. Data within 1 year of first
clinical contact were considered baseline data.

Clinical outcomes
The primary outcome is malignant VA, defined as a composite endpoint of
sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), ventricular fibrillation (VF), appropriate ICD intervention, or (aborted) SCD. Sustained VT is defined as a VT
which lasts >_30 s, or <30 s when terminated electrically or pharmacologically. Appropriate ICD intervention is classified as ICD therapy (antitachycardia pacing or shock) for VF/VT. Aborted SCD is defined as basic life support

for cardiac arrest with return of stable circulation. SCD is defined as death
(with or without documented VF) within 1 h of acute symptoms or an unexplained death with no antecedent history of worsening symptoms.
Carriers were censored if one of the endpoints occurred.

Predictor variables
Possible predictor variables were based on predictors for malignant VA
in ARVC and DCM because p.Arg14del mutation carriers may display
both ARVC or DCM phenotypes. Furthermore, possible predictors from
the 2014 PLN p.Arg14del cohort study were included as possible predictors.10 All prespecified predictors and their definitions are displayed in
Supplementary material online, Table S1. The final number of predictors
chosen was based on the number of events, with a 10:1 ratio of events
per considered predictor.

Missing data
As a result of the retrospective design, there were absence of diagnostic
protocols and in some cases lack of clinical evaluation resulting in multiple
variables with missing data. Missing data were considered missing at random
and accounted for by multiple imputation. Imputation models for left and
right ventricular ejection fraction included the qualitative assessment of
ejection fraction. A total of 100 imputed datasets were generated.

Statistical analysis
SPSS Version 24.0.0.1 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA), R version 3.5.1, and
RStudio Version 1.1.383 (RStudio, Boston, MA, USA) with packages rms,
survminer, riskRegression, and mice were used for analysis. Continuous variables are expressed as mean +/- standard deviation (SD) if normally distributed; median +/- interquartile range (IQR) of 25-75% is used if the data were
skewed. Categorical variables are reported as percentages (counts/total
counts). Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the effect
of possible predictors while taking the time to event into account. To correct for family clustering, a frailty term for family id was used. Proportionalhazard assumptions were verified as well as linearity of the association for
continuous predictors. The model was fitted using stepwise backward selection based on Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) where, in each step,
candidate predictors that do not significantly lead to information loss of the
model when deleted, e.g. significant difference in AIC value, were deleted.
Stepwise selection was performed in each imputed dataset, where the final
model consisted of variables selected in >50% of datasets. Results were
pooled using Rubin's rules. Discrimination of the model was described with
Harrell's C-statistic. Apparent C-statistic was estimated by fitting the final
model on the original data. The model was internally validated using bootstrap sampling, 1000 bootstraps, to correct for overfitting. Predicted and
observed outcomes were graphically evaluated with a calibration plot.
Universal shrinkage factors were estimated using the calibration slope of
the linear predictor. The ARVC model was applied to the complete PLN
p.Arg14del cohort, regardless of phenotype, as carriers may display an
ARVC (-like) phenotype and risk prediction with the ARVC model might
be suitable for all PLN p.Arg14del carriers. Further details on model presentation, comparison to existing models and clinical utility methods can be
found in the Supplementary material online.

Results
Study cohort
The final study cohort consists of 679 p.Arg14del mutation carriers
(Figure 1). Most of the excluded carriers were only genetically counselled at participating centres without any cardiologic data available.

death. Affected individuals have a poor prognosis and high mortality
from late adolescence onwards.4,10
Previously, two risk factors were identified that contribute to the
prediction of malignant VA in p.Arg14del mutation carriers, i.e. left
ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF <45%) and occurrence of sustained or non-sustained VA.10 These risk factors appeared to be
more accurate than the general DCM criteria for primary prevention
implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implantation.15 How
ever, these risk factors were explored in a mixed cohort of carriers
with and without sustained VA at baseline. Furthermore, the sensitivity and specificity of the identified risk factors remained limited and
accurate quantification of individual risk is not possible. In addition to
this PLN p.Arg14del specific risk model, an ARVC risk model for the
prediction of malignant VA was recently published, designed to guide
primary prevention ICD implantation in ARVC patients fulfilling the
2010 Task Force criteria.16 This model might also be valid in all
p.Arg14del carriers as carriers can develop an ARVC phenotype.
This multicentre cohort study aims to improve risk stratification
for primary prevention ICD implantation by developing a new prediction model for sustained VA in p.Arg14del mutation carriers without
previous sustained VA. The proposed model will be compared to the
existing PLN and ARVC models.

resonance imaging. VA, ventricular arrhythmia.

Twenty (3%) of the 679 carriers were Spanish. The majority of the
final cohort (83%) were family members of an index patient and most
subjects were asymptomatic at baseline (85%). Almost half were
male (43%), and the median age was 42 years (IQR 27-55). At baseline, only 10 (1%) already had an ICD, or received an ICD within
1 month. Finally, 28 (4%) p.Arg14del mutation carriers had an ARVC
diagnosis by the Task Force criteria at baseline. Baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1.

Outcomes
During a median follow-up of 4.3 years (IQR 1.7-7.4), 72 (10.6%)
p.Arg14del mutation carriers experienced the composite endpoint
of malignant VA, with a crude event rate of 2.0% per year. The
Kaplan-Meier estimate of 5-year event rate was 8.5% [95% confidence interval (CI) 6-11%], with events occurring throughout follow-up (Figure 2).
The primary composite outcome of malignant VA consisted of 37
appropriate ICD therapies, 25 sustained VT/VF, 6 SCD, 3 aborted

the final model can be found in the Supplementary material online.
With the final multivariable model, we calculated the predicted
5-year malignant VA risk of each carrier in the dataset. After dividing
the population into quintiles of predicted risk, a clear distinction in
risk between the risk groups is shown in Figure 3 with the lowest risk
quintiles having a very low malignant VA rate.

Model validation
Internal validation with bootstrapping resulted in an optimism
corrected C-statistic of the final model of 0.83 (95% CI
0.78-0.88), corresponding to a strong model. Visualization of calibration is represented in Supplementary material online, Figure S2.
Agreement between predicted and observed 5-year malignant VA
risk was excellent. With bootstrapping we calculated a calibration
slope of 0.913.

Performance of existing risk models
Applying the previous PLN risk model in the current cohort yielded a
C-statistic of 0.68 (95% CI 0.61-0.75). C-statistic of the proposed
model was significantly higher (delta 0.11, P = 0.002). Applying the
ARVC risk model to the complete current cohort of p.Arg14del mutation carriers regardless of ARVC diagnosis yielded a C-statistic of
0.74 (95% CI 0.68-0.80). C-statistic of the proposed model was significantly higher (delta 0.07, P = 0.006). Although more patients had
right and left ventricular involvement, only a fraction of carriers had a
Task Force-compatible ARVC diagnosis at baseline, and therefore,
these results are probably not surprising; further results on the comparison with the ARVC model are provided in Supplementary material online, Figures S3 and S4. Calibration is shown in Supplementary
material online, Figure S2, and high- and low-risk groups can be

..
.. distinguished; however, calibration was not ideal with comparable
.. observed outcomes in the medium-high- and high-risk quintiles.
..
..
..
.. Clinical utility
.. We explored scenarios where ICD implantation is based on the out..
.. come of the prediction models. Figure 4 shows carriers with a pre.. dicted risk greater than the risk threshold that would be implanted
..
.. with an ICD. As visualized, the proposed model leads to less false
..
.. positives (ICD, no VA) or false negatives (No ICD, VA) compared to
.. the existing PLN model. For example, by applying the proposed
..
.. model to the study cohort (n = 679) with a risk threshold of >10%
.. would result in 161 carriers receiving an ICD, with 42 having a malig..
.. nant VA compared to 162 carriers with ICD, with 37 having a malig..
.. nant VA with the existing model. Additionally, we compared
.. diagnostic performance (e.g. sensitivity/specificity) of the risk models
..
.. and potential cut-offs in Supplementary material online, Table S5. Not
.. surprisingly, diagnostic performance was heavily dependent on the
..
.. chosen risk threshold. Sensitivity and specificity of the previous PLN
... model was 66.1% and 80%, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity of
..
.. the proposed model ranged from 58.9% to 98.2% and 53.9% to
.. 88.1%, depending on the risk threshold.
..
With the proposed risk model, several risk thresholds seem viable
..
.. and factors other than malignant VA risk should be considered when
..
.. deciding on a threshold for an individual patient. However, if one
.. would adhere to the generally accepted risk threshold >5% in 5 years
..
.. (i.e. 1%/year) to justify implantation of an ICD,19 the proposed model
..
.. would result in 246 carriers being treated with an ICD, with 52 of
.. them experiencing a malignant VA. Even more relevant, this risk
..
.. threshold would result in 4 false negatives, while 433 ICD implanta.. tions are avoided compared to treating all carriers. Individual risk

Discussion
Main findings

Prior studies
Event rate of malignant VA was lower in this study compared to the
2014 p.Arg14del cohort of the previous model (crude annual rate 2%
vs. 5.4%).10 We hypothesize ascertainment bias playing a role, with
increasing inclusion of asymptomatic family members, 85% in this
study vs. 58% in the previous report.21 In addition, we excluded carriers with malignant VA at baseline who are more likely to develop
new malignant VA. Malignant VA rate was also lower than the ARVC
risk model cohort (2.0% vs. 5.6% annual event rate).22 This was
expected as included patients in the ARVC cohort were generally
more severely affected because they had to fulfil the strict 2010 Task
Force criteria.23 Risk stratification models have proven to be useful

While the event rate of incident malignant VA is significant in individuals with the PLN p.Arg14del variant, over 90% remain event-free at
5 years. Therefore, risk stratification is needed before ICD implantation to avoid unnecessary ICD implantations while protecting the
majority of carriers from SCD (Graphical abstract).
In this study, we developed and internally validated a new prediction model for malignant VA in PLN p.Arg14del mutation carriers
without prior malignant VA. Discriminative ability was excellent and
calibration was adequate with agreement between predicted and
observed risk (Supplementary material online, Figure S2). Using the
proposed model is superior to using the existing models with a significantly higher discriminative ability (C-statistic) and less false positives
or false negatives demonstrated in the scenario analyses. This suggests that a mutation-specific prediction model improves performance for this mixed phenotype population of PLN p.Arg14del
mutation carriers, compared to applying phenotypic driven models
for DCM and ARVC to all PLN p.Arg14del mutation carriers. For
DCM, no direct comparison was made as the existing PLN
p.Arg14del model has LVEF <45% as risk factor; thus, the comparison
with the DCM model with LVEF <35% as risk factor was deemed redundant. The proposed model has more selected predictors than the
previous PLN model. Adding PVC count, amount of negative T waves,
and presence of low-voltage ECG as predictors can account for the
increased model performance with the proposed model. The greatest clinical utility of this model lies in the individual estimations of 5year risk derived with the nomogram or online calculator. While the
acceptable risk threshold for an individual patient is also dependent
on other factors, such as the country's health system, shared decision-making, and non-SCD mortality risk, we suggest that a 5-year
malignant VA risk of >5% should be the minimum to consider ICD
therapy. Above this risk threshold, ICD implantation can be considered, with stronger recommendation with increasing predicted risks.
Moreover, with a lower risk threshold, ICD harm probably outweighs ICD benefit given the fact that previous studies in inherited
cardiomyopathies have shown a significant burden of ICD-related
complications (27%) or inappropriate shocks (14%) in ICD-treated
patients.20

prediction using mutation-specific phenotypic features can improve
accuracy compared to a more generic approach.

evaluated and new predictors might be included, such as strain imaging.26 We compared clinical characteristics of carriers with complete
data vs. carriers with incomplete data to assess the impact of missing
data on results. Clinical characteristics of the group with missing data
were mostly similar to those of the group without missing data
(Supplementary material online, Table S6). The only characteristic significantly different was the amount of negative T waves, which was
higher in the group with incomplete data [1 (IQR 0-2) vs. 0 (IQR 0-
1), P < 0.001].
True SCD risk is obscured by ICD implantation in the high-risk
(deemed by the treating physician) group of the study cohort.
However, removing ICD recipients from the cohort would not be a
valid alternative. Firstly, this would lead to insufficient power, but
more importantly would lead to new biases. Removing high-risk carriers from this cohort will lead to selection bias and underestimate
true SCD risk. Similar issues pertain to other observational datasets
where ICD implantation is performed, for example HCM or
ARVC.16,24 For PLN mutations carriers a randomized controlled trial
is not feasible. This is why we considered the composite endpoint of
malignant VA as a surrogate marker for SCD. While being a serious
event, not all carriers experiencing malignant VA would suffer from
SCD. This should be kept in mind when choosing the risk threshold.
In order to assess robustness of the combined endpoint, we analysed
whether predictor effects of ICD therapy were similar to predictors
for the other malignant VA endpoints (Supplementary material online, Table S7). Similarly, we analysed if predictor effects were different for life-threatening VA [defined as VT >240 b.p.m., VF, or
(aborted) SCD] compared to the other VA (Supplementary material
online, Table S8). Univariable hazard ratios of selected predictors
were mostly similar for appropriate ICD therapy vs. other VA, and
life-threatening VA vs. other VA. Thus, VA risk prediction with this
model is valid but the predicted risk of the model reflects all malignant VA and not only life-threatening VA or SCD. Nearly all carriers
who experienced SCD had a significant decrease in LVEF, which can
be explained by it being a major risk factor for malignant VA.
However, this may also be an indication that malignant VA are more
lethal in carriers with a reduced ejection fraction.
We compared the proposed model to the existing PLN risk model
for phenotypes of DCM (not directly) and ARVC. Importantly, these
models were developed in patients with a DCM or ARVC phenotype
and were not designed for patients with a DCM or ARVC causing
genotype without phenotype. This is one of the reasons why this
study cannot be seen as an external validation of the DCM and
ARVC models, but rather tested if the model might work for all
p.Arg14del mutation carriers, regardless of phenotype. Comparison
of the models with only DCM or ARVC positive patients was not
possible, as the power was insufficient for these analyses. Finally, external validation of the prediction model is desirable; however, it
would currently be challenging to find a large enough cohort.
