Graphical Abstract

Formation of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein remnants and their role in atherogenesis. Metabolic scheme for the generation and clearance of triglyceride-rich
lipoprotein remnant particles (A). In hypertriglyceridaemia, overproduction and inefficient lipolysis of both very low-density lipoprotein and chylomicrons
lead to increased remnant formation. Triglyceride-rich lipoprotein remnants contribute to the initiation and progression of atherosclerotic lesions (B).
Particle retention in the subendothelial space is followed by inflammation, cholesterol deposition, and macrophage foam cell formation.

Introduction
For decades, triglycerides (TG) have been considered a putative risk
factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).1,2
Despite mounting evidence from population and genetic studies, controversy persists. Much of this relates to two key questions: first,
which is the culprit(s): TG molecules per se, TG-rich lipoproteins
(TRL), or TRL remnants, and second, for TRL or their remnants,
which components give rise to risk: cholesterol contained in these
particles, other features, or both? Answers are essential to understand better the pathological consequences of raised TG levels, especially in the context of residual cardiovascular risk when other major
factors, particularly low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), are

about the structure, function, metabolism, and atherogenicity of TRL
and their remnants, and importantly, to identify targeted therapeutic
approaches to address residual risk associated with elevated TG
levels.

Search strategy

Recent advances in human genetics, together with a large body of epidemiologic, preclinical, and clinical trial results, provide strong support for a causal association between triglycerides (TG), TG-rich lipoproteins (TRL), and TRL remnants, and increased risk of myocardial
infarction, ischaemic stroke, and aortic valve stenosis. These data also indicate that TRL and their remnants may contribute significantly to
residual cardiovascular risk in patients on optimized low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-lowering therapy. This statement critically appraises
current understanding of the structure, function, and metabolism of TRL, and their pathophysiological role in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Key points are (i) a working definition of normo- and hypertriglyceridaemic states and their relation to risk of
ASCVD, (ii) a conceptual framework for the generation of remnants due to dysregulation of TRL production, lipolysis, and remodelling, as
well as clearance of remnant lipoproteins from the circulation, (iii) the pleiotropic proatherogenic actions of TRL and remnants at the arterial wall, (iv) challenges in defining, quantitating, and assessing the atherogenic properties of remnant particles, and (v) exploration of the
relative atherogenicity of TRL and remnants compared to LDL. Assessment of these issues provides a foundation for evaluating
approaches to effectively reduce levels of TRL and remnants by targeting either production, lipolysis, or hepatic clearance, or a combination of these mechanisms. This consensus statement updates current understanding in an integrated manner, thereby providing a platform
for new therapeutic paradigms targeting TRL and their remnants, with the aim of reducing the risk of ASCVD.

clinical relevance

and are metabolized to VLDL remnants, intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDL), and LDL. Chylomicrons, made in the intestine, are
larger and contain apoB48, and are also metabolized to remnant particles but not to IDL and LDL (Figure 1). The intestine also secretes
apoB48-containing VLDL-sized particles.3
TRL decrease in size during lipolysis; concomitantly, the core
content of TG decreases and CE increases due to cholesteryl
ester transfer protein (CETP)-mediated exchange of TRL-TG for
LDL- and high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-CE. During lipolysis
apoB remains with the TRL on which it was secreted. With one
apoB molecule per particle, apoB concentration is thus a measure
of particle number. Other apolipoproteins (particularly apoCs)
transfer mainly to HDL during lipolysis. The spectrum of
apoB100- and apoB48-containing remnants varies with plasma TG
levels (Figure 1). At optimal levels (<1.2 mmol/L or <100 mg/dL),4
efficient lipolysis results in limited accumulation of remnant

(apo) B-containing lipoproteins (VLDL, IDL, LDL-very low-, intermediate-, and low-density lipoproteins, respectively), their density and size (diameter in nm), distribution, and their content of triglyceride and cholesteryl ester (as percent of mass). The stylized distribution of the relative amount
of remnant particles in subjects with optimal triglyceride (<1.2 mmol/L) and elevated triglyceride (3.0 mmol/L) is shown for apoB100 (orange) and
apoB48 (blue) containing lipoproteins. The profile of 'apoB48 remnants' is based on the apoB48 concentrations in VLDL1, VLDL2, and IDL in the late
(post-peak) phase of lipid absorption and after an overnight fast, whereas that of 'apoB100 remnants' is based on the concentration of apoB100 in
VLDL2 and IDL. Based on data from Bjornson et al.3 CE, cholesteryl ester; IDL, intermediate-density lipoprotein; LDL, low-density lipoprotein; TG,

Triglycerides are an efficient means of storing excess energy, mainly
in adipose tissue. In the blood, TG and cholesteryl esters (CE)
circulate within the core of spherical lipoproteins, covered with a
monolayer 'shell' of phospholipids and free cholesterol, with apolipoproteins stabilizing the structure. Apolipoprotein (apo) B is the major
structural protein in TRL, present as either apoB100, made in the
liver, or a truncated form, apoB48, made in the intestine. These isoforms, rather than size or density, best define the TRL class. Very
low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), made in the liver, contain apoB100

Consensus key points
o Accumulating evidence from epidemiologic and genetic studies is
consistent with a causal relationship between ASCVD risk and
elevated plasma levels of TG, TRL, and TRL remnants.
o TRL and TRL remnants accumulate in the plasma at fasting TG
levels >1.2 mmol/L (>100 mg/dL).
o At fasting TG levels >1.7 mmol/L (>150 mg/dL), there is consensus
that ASCVD risk becomes clinically relevant;4,20,38 TG levels
>10 mmol/L (>880 mg/dL) confer a high risk of pancreatitis with
the risk increasing significantly when TG levels are >20 mmol/L.

after adjustment for statin-induced LDL-C lowering.39-42 These findings provide impetus for the development of innovative therapeutics
to lower TG and TRL and their remnants for potential cardiovascular
benefit.43

Metabolism of triglyceride-rich
lipoproteins and their remnants
Key questions
o What are the major metabolic defects in hypertriglyceridaemia?
o What causes remnant lipoproteins to accumulate?

The primary role of TRL is to transport TG to adipose tissue for storage and to skeletal and cardiac muscle for energy production. The
metabolism of apoB-containing lipoproteins is integral to these functions44-46 (Figure 4), with regulation of the assembly, secretion, and
clearance of TRL discussed below.

What factors regulate the assembly and
secretion of triglyceride-rich
lipoproteins?
Hormones, nutrients, neural signals, and multiple enzymes and proteins, including CD36, FATP4, FABP1, FABP2, MTP, apoAIV, apoCIII,
perilipin, and SAR1B, regulate the assembly and secretion of chylomicrons.47 These factors direct lipids to storage in cytosolic lipid droplets in enterocytes, or oxidative breakdown, or incorporation into
pre-chylomicron particles in the endoplasmic reticulum, which
undergo expansion to full-sized chylomicrons.48 The availability of
apoB48-regulated by insulin, gut peptides, neural networks, and nutrient signals [fatty acids (FA) and glucose]-determines the rate of
chylomicron formation. Increased numbers of small chylomicrons
are secreted by individuals with insulin resistance.49,50 Intestinal lipid
droplets appear to act as temporary lipid stores, modulating the release and size of chylomicrons following meals.51 Changes in intestinal lymphatic flow may be important in determining how rapidly
dietary TG are delivered as TG-FA to peripheral tissues.52
For VLDL, the chronic effects of excess nutrients and insulin resistance are most important, increasing hepatic secretion of larger particles.53,54 VLDL assembly and secretion are upregulated by (i) the
delivery of FA released from insulin-resistant adipocytes, (ii) the
increased delivery of remnant TG-FA to the liver due to reduced
peripheral lipolysis of chylomicron and VLDL-TG, and (iii) the
increased de novo lipogenesis55 (Figure 4).

What factors regulate the lipolysis of
triglyceride-rich lipoproteins?
Clearance of TRL involves two interrelated processes, lipolysis of TG
by LpL, and hepatic clearance of remnants. Lipoprotein lipase-mediated hydrolysis of TG was thought to be a relatively simple process
regulated by tissue LpL expression, and the content of apoCII (an activator) and apoCIII (an inhibitor) on TRL. However, accumulating

particles, predominantly in the small VLDL and IDL size range. At
higher TG levels (e.g. >_3.0 mmol/L or >_260 mg/dL), increased secretion and impaired lipolysis result in the substantial accumulation of chylomicron and VLDL remnants.
Remnant lipoproteins are enriched in cholesterol (both free and
esterified) and are depleted in apoC proteins and enriched in apoE
(Figure 2).5-7 The remnant lipoproteins seen in type III hyperlipidaemia ('dysbetalipoproteinaemia' or 'remnant' hyperlipidaemia) are
an extreme example of this particle type. Remnants are cleared directly by the liver or converted to IDL and LDL. In most people, remnant lipoproteins (and TRL in general) are highly heterogeneous
(Figure 1).3,6-9 Thus, defining which features confer atherogenicity is
challenging.
Extreme elevations of plasma TG levels (>10 mmol/L or
>880 mg/dL) increase the risk for acute pancreatitis10-13 but it is
less widely appreciated that fasting levels from as low as
1.2 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) can be associated with a cluster of
metabolic abnormalities that include accumulation of TRL and remnants,14 as well as increased cardiovascular disease events15,16 (Figure
1). These lipoprotein particles become more abundant as TG concentrations increase from 'borderline' to 'moderate', 'severe', and 'extreme'. Working consensus definitions for these categories of
hypertriglyceridaemia are given in Box 1.4,14,17-23
Over the past three decades, epidemiologic and genetic evidence
has accumulated to support the concept that elevated levels of
plasma TG, TRL, and TRL remnants are causally related to an
increased risk of ASCVD-related events-myocardial infarction (MI),
stroke, and aortic valve stenosis-and all-cause mortality.1,2,17,19,20,24-28 Mendelian randomization studies focused on variants in the genes encoding apoAV, apoCIII, lipoprotein lipase (LpL)
and the angiopoietin-like proteins 3, 4, and 8 (ANGPTL3, ANGPTL4,
and ANGPTL8) have been highly informative.29-35 Currently, given
that no clear signal indicates which features of TRL give rise to risk,
and recognizing the need for further study to identify the best index
of ASCVD risk, plasma TG levels are a reasonable surrogate. The increase in absolute risk is greatest for MI (approximately four-fold at
TG levels >5 mmol/L or >440 mg/dL vs. <1 mmol/L or <88 mg/dL),
and less for ischaemic stroke and aortic stenosis (Figure 3).11,17,27,28
Furthermore, elevated plasma TG levels (with the accumulation of
TRL and remnant particles) are related not only to subclinical atherosclerosis and vascular inflammation independently of LDL-C in statinnaive, apparently healthy subjects, but also equally to residual cardiovascular risk among statin-treated patients, especially those with
diabetes mellitus.2,20,36-38 There is also evidence that reductions in

protein
(GPIHBP1)18,56 (Figure 4). Complete loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in genes encoding several of these proteins can cause severe
hypertriglyceridaemia (LpL, apoCII, apoAV, LMF1, and GPIHBP1) or
hypolipidaemia (apoCIII, ANGPTL3, and ANGPTL4). Heterozygous
LOF has also been identified in some patients with polygenic severe
hypertriglyceridaemia.13,57
Two of these proteins, apoCIII and ANGPTL3, have emerged as
key therapeutic targets. ApoCIII is a major determinant of how efficiently TG are cleared from the plasma.58 Loss-of-function variants of
APOC3 that result in reduced synthesis of the protein are associated
with absent or low circulating apoCIII levels, increased efficiency of
TG removal from TRL, and lower plasma TG levels,59,60 whereas
increased apoCIII levels, as seen in insulin resistance and obesity, result in reduced clearance and higher plasma TG61-63 (Figure 4).
ANGPTL3, 4, and 8 are inhibitors of LpL and play important roles in
targeting chylomicrons and VLDL to white adipose tissue or skeletal
muscle, depending on nutritional and hormonal status at any time.45
Loss-of-function variants in ANGPTL3 have been associated with
reduced plasma levels of TG, LDL-C, and HDL-C.32,64,65

Which factors regulate the generation
and clearance of chylomicron and very
low-density lipoprotein remnants?
Remnant formation is enhanced by overproduction of TRL or by genetic or physiological factors that limit lipolysis, or both. At moderately
elevated plasma TG levels, there is increased secretion of large
TG-enriched VLDL and chylomicrons from the liver and small intestine that, when combined with suboptimal LpL action in obesity,
insulin resistance, and/or diabetes mellitus, results in remnant accumulation.36 Variants in the LpL gene that cause partial LOF of the LpL
enzyme, or in other genes affecting LpL activity, also lower the rate of

TG removal from VLDL and chylomicrons, resulting in elevated
plasma TG levels and remnant accumulation even when TRL secretion is normal (Figure 5).5,44,66 The absence of lipolysis (i.e. complete
LPL deficiency) results in the extreme elevation of large 'nascent' TRL
without any concomitant increase in remnants;36,67,68 here, pancreatitis rather than ASCVD is the major risk.
Metabolic processing of newly secreted TRL by LpL generates a
partially lipolysed heterogeneous population of remnant particles.
Some of the apoB100 remnants are efficiently further lipolysed by
LpL and hepatic lipase (HL) to LDL; they can be viewed as 'transient'
remnants. Other apoB100 remnants, and all apoB48 remnants,
undergo remodelling that renders them resistant to further lipolysis,
remaining in the VLDL-IDL density range as 'end-product' remnants,
until they are removed directly from the circulation by the liver. The
underlying basis for these alternative pathways of TRL remnant metabolism is not well understood (Figure 5). The longer a remnant
remains in the circulation, the more it becomes enriched with CE;
the cholesterol content in these end-product remnants can exceed
7500 molecules per particle (vs. 2000-2700 in LDL). Several factors,
including activating or inhibitory apolipoproteins (apoCII and apoCIII,
respectively) on the TRL surface, and LpL availability, influence residence time in the circulation and the potential entry and retention of
remnants within the arterial subendothelial space.5
As stated above, all chylomicron remnants and variable amounts
of VLDL remnants undergo direct hepatic clearance (Figures 2 and 4),
mainly involving the LDL receptor, although studies in mice suggest
putative roles for LDL receptor-related protein 1 and heparan sulphate proteoglycans (particularly syndecan 1).69,70 For chylomicron
remnants, functional apoE on the particle is required (apoB48 is not a
ligand).71 In type III hyperlipidaemia, patients are homozygous for the
APOE2 variant that lacks the ability to bind to lipoprotein receptors;
however, only a minority develop 'remnant' dyslipidaemia, implying

Plasma TG varies over a wide range in the population, and as levels rise, the risk
of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease increases continuously. For this reason,
as with LDL-C, it is inappropriate to use classical percent thresholds (5th, 95th
percentile) to define 'normal' and 'abnormal'. The cut-points here are derived
from previous guidelines, epidemiological surveys and studies of TG metabolism.
Extreme elevation is the threshold for high risk of acute pancreatitis. The division
between 'optimal' and 'borderline' is based on recommendations from previous
guidelines and the findings that remnant populations begin to be detectable using
the remnant-like particle assay above this level and small, dense LDL formation is
concomitantly enhanced. These cut-points are arbitrary but in the view of the
Consensus Panel may serve as a working definition that has clinical utility. There
is no distinction by gender4,14,17-23

that secondary acquired or inherited factors (e.g. insulin resistance)
are needed to increase VLDL and chylomicron secretion or impair
lipolysis, resulting in hyperlipidaemia. An identifying feature is a grossly elevated cholesterol/TG ratio in TRL, due to marked accumulation
of VLDL and chylomicron 'end-product' remnants highly enriched in
cholesterol (up to 10 000 molecules per particle)5 (Figure 5). The elevated ASCVD risk in this dyslipidaemia is prima facie evidence for the
role of remnant lipoproteins in atherogenesis, as LDL levels are typically low.72

Hepatic clearance of VLDL remnants is mediated by either
apoB100 or apoE through receptor-dependent and receptorindependent pathways;7,17,71,73 25-75% of these particles are
removed directly rather than converted to LDL. Which factors determine the fate of a remnant particle (in the VLDL or IDL density
range) remains incompletely defined, although apoCIII inhibits whereas apoE and possibly HL facilitate hepatic remnant uptake.74,75 In
mice, apoCIII impacts plasma TG levels and remnant accumulation
when LpL activity is reduced, but not when normal.75 Additional

Figure 4 Overview of apolipoprotein B lipoprotein metabolism. During absorption of fat from the diet, chylomicrons are generated by the enterocytes in the small intestine, travel via lymphatics, and appear in the bloodstream. Lipidation of a primordial apolipoprotein (apo) B48-containing particle (apoB48, a truncated form of apoB100 made solely in the intestine) is mediated by microsomal triglyceride transfer protein using triglyceride
synthesized from absorbed fatty acids. In a similar assembly process, a large triglyceride-rich, apoB100-containing very low-density lipoprotein
(VLDL)1 is made in the liver using a variety of sources for triglyceride synthesis-de novo lipogenesis, fatty acids released from intracellular storage
droplets, free fatty acids taken up from the circulation after their release from adipose tissue, and triglyceride fatty acids present in VLDL chylomicron
remnants. Chylomicrons and VLDL1 (and to an extent VLDL2) compete for the same lipolytic mechanism. Lipoprotein lipase is anchored to the luminal surface of the capillary endothelium in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue by glycophosphatidylinositol-anchored high-density lipoprotein-binding protein-1. This enzyme hydrolyzes triglyceride in the core of the particle releasing fatty acids into the underlying tissue bed. Lipase maturation
factor 1 is essential for the secretion of functional lipase from adipose tissue and muscle. ApoCII is an activator (essential cofactor) of lipoprotein lipase, whereas apoCIII is an inhibitor of the enzyme and of remnant particle uptake. The angiopoietin-like proteins 3, 4, and 8 (ANGPTL3, 4, 8) have a
tissue-specific role in modifying (inhibiting) lipoprotein lipase action, whereas apoAV increases lipoprotein lipase-mediated lipolysis. Lipolysis of chylomicrons leads to the formation of remnant particles, which are cleared by the liver via the low-density lipoprotein receptors and, based on mouse
studies, the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1. Likewise, VLDL1 is delipidated to VLDL2, remnants, and intermediate-density lipoproteins, which are either removed by liver receptors or converted to low-density lipoprotein as the final product. Smaller VLDL2 is also made by the
liver and can be delipidated to intermediate-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein (for more detail see refs43-45). It should be noted that lipolysis of both chylomicrons and VLDL in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle is neither equally divided nor randomly apportioned but is determined by
insulin mediated regulation of lipoprotein lipase in each tissue, with insulin stimulating lipoprotein lipase in adipose tissue and inhibiting it in skeletal
muscle. In addition, ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL8 inhibit lipoprotein lipase activity in skeletal muscle in the fed state and ANGPTL4 inhibits lipoprotein
lipase activity in white adipose tissue during fasting.45 FFA, free fatty acids; GPIHBP1, glycophosphatidylinositol-anchored high-density lipoproteinbinding protein-1; IDL, intermediate-density lipoprotein; LDL, low-density lipoprotein; LDLr, low-density lipoprotein receptor; LMF1, lipase maturation factor 1; LRP1, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1; MTP, microsomal triglyceride transfer protein; VLDL, very low-density

studies in mice suggest that endothelial lipase may play a role in remnant removal independent of LpL and LDL receptors.76
The preceding discussion illustrates the difficulty inherent in defining remnants. Identifying a proteomic or lipidomic signature specific
for a sub-population of TRL that contributes to atherogenesis is crucial; lacking this, a looser concept is necessary, as discussed below.

Why do fasting plasma triglyceride levels
vary widely?
Plasma TG levels range from 0.33 to 120 mmol/L (30 to
10 000 mg/dL)13,17 (Figure 6), reflecting variability in the rates of secretion and clearance of TG and apoB in VLDL and chylomicrons.61,77
With borderline to moderately elevated plasma TG, overproduction
is typically the main contributor, whereas reduced LpL-mediated lipolysis of TG is the dominant abnormality when plasma TG is severely
elevated. The two- to four-fold range of secretion and several-fold
range of clearance underlie the observed population variability.
Another reason for the wide range of plasma TG levels is variability
in the non-fasting (postprandial) state. Whether fasting or non-fasting
plasma TG levels provide a better index of ASCVD risk is

discussed in Box 2.3,25,80-92

Consensus key points
o Chylomicrons and VLDL (TRL) are assembled in the small
intestine and liver, respectively, and transport TG and cholesterol
in the circulation.
o Plasma levels of TRL are determined by the rate of production,
the efficiency of removal of TG content by lipolysis, and hepatic
clearance.
o Several enzymes, lipid transfer proteins, and the lipid and protein
composition of TRL and remnants all contribute to the regulation
of lipolysis and hepatic clearance of these lipoproteins.
o In severe hypertriglyceridaemia, a reduced TRL clearance rate is
the dominant metabolic abnormality.
o Partial removal of TG from chylomicrons or VLDL creates
remnants. Remnant levels depend on the extent of lipolysis,
conversion of VLDL remnants to LDL, and the efficiency of
hepatic removal of both VLDL and chylomicron remnants.
o Remnant particles may contain up to four-fold greater cholesterol
content per particle than LDL.

Figure 5 Metabolism of remnant lipoproteins. Remnants are a population of particles in the circulation that have been partially lipolysed by lipoprotein lipase. Efficient lipolysis (broad green arrow) leads to rapid conversion to low-density lipoprotein, with little remnant formation. Causes of
remnant accumulation are overproduction of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins or compromised (but not completely absent) lipase action (red arrows).
'Transient' remnants in the very low-density lipoprotein/intermediate-density lipoprotein range are converted to low-density lipoprotein; chylomicron remnants are not converted to low-density lipoproteins (see Graphical Abstract and Figure 4). Inefficient lipolysis increases the residence time
of remnants and they undergo remodelling, acquiring cholesterol (specifically cholesteryl ester by transfer mediated by cholesteryl ester transfer protein), and apolipoprotein (apo) E. This remodelling can lead to a particle that is no longer susceptible to lipolysis-an 'end-product' remnant-with a
prolonged residence time in the circulation.44 CETP, cholesteryl ester transfer protein; IDL, intermediate-density lipoprotein; LDL, low-density lipoprotein; LpL, lipoprotein lipase; VLDL, very low-density lipoprotein.

TRL, their remnants, and ASCVD

Does abnormal triglyceride-rich
lipoprotein metabolism impact other
lipoprotein classes?
As LDL is the terminal product of the VLDL delipidation and remodelling cascade, changes in VLDL metabolism impact LDL structure,
function, and metabolism. Plasma TG modifies LDL size and composition;66,93 higher levels result in small, dense LDL generated via
CETP-mediated lipid exchange of LDL-CE with TRL-TG and subsequent lipolysis. These particles may be enriched in bioactive inflammatory lysolipids and are more likely to be retained in arterial
atherosclerotic lesions because of their longer plasma residence
time.66,93
Circulating HDL are highly heterogeneous in their physicochemical properties and biological activities, reflecting the complexity of
metabolic processes underlying their production, intravascular
remodelling, and catabolism.2,94-96 Hypertriglyceridaemia leads to
significant perturbations in HDL metabolism, and in direct

consequence, to subnormal HDL-C levels.2,94,95,97,98 This involves
major modification of the HDL proteome and lipidome,99,100 resulting in attenuated vasculoprotective functions including reverse cholesterol transport, inhibition of oxidation, and anti-inflammatory
activities.96,101,102 The relevance of these alterations to increased
ASCVD risk in hypertriglyceridaemia is unclear due to physiologically
interrelated pathways.

Consensus key points
o Changes in VLDL metabolism impact the structure, composition,
metabolism, and function of LDL and HDL particles.
o Hypertriglyceridaemia favours the formation of small, dense LDL
with potentially increased atherogenicity and smaller, denser HDL
particles with a perturbed lipidome and proteome and defective
vasculoprotective functions. The degree to which these alterations
contribute to cardiovascular risk is unclear.

Figure 6 Causes of hypertriglyceridaemia in the population. This schematic representation illustrates the distribution of plasma triglyceride
levels in a population (adapted from a survey of >100 000 individuals in the Copenhagen General Population Study).17 The distribution is
segmented by colours according to the triglyceride cut-points in Box 1, i.e. optimal triglyceride <1.2 mmol/L (green), borderline elevated,
1.2-1.7 mmol/L (yellow), moderately elevated, 1.7-5.7 mmol/L (pink), and severe or extreme hypertriglyceridaemia, >5.7 mmol/L (brown).
(Note plasma samples in this survey were non-fasting whereas cut-points in Box 1 are for fasting values). Increased production of very low-density
lipoprotein in the liver is the primary abnormality leading to higher levels of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and remnants in individuals with borderline/moderately increased plasma triglyceride, whereas decreased lipolysis is the predominant feature at higher triglyceride concentrations, with accumulation of both very low-density lipoprotein and chylomicrons. Individuals with the most severe forms of
hypertriglyceridaemia, particularly those with monogenic causes, may have normal production rates and extremely low levels of lipolysis. TG,

secreted from the intestine and liver become 'transient' remnants
very soon after entering the plasma compartment due to their exposure to remodelling enzymes, metabolically active apolipoproteins,
and lipid transfer factors and hence are included in the overall remnant particle count.
When considering the clinical relevance of particle abundance,
it is noteworthy that despite the predominance of LDL particle
numbers in fasting and postprandial states, the relative danger of
'remnants' cannot simply be equated with their particle number,
as multiple factors are implicated in a comparison of the relative
atherogenicity of these two sets of particles. Such factors include
plasma residence time, cholesterol load, rates of penetration and
retention in the arterial intima, susceptibility to modification in
situ, rates of uptake in macrophages, and propensity to form proinflammatory foam cells.93 Thus, even with uncertainty regarding
the exact proportion of cholesterol carried in remnants, in part
due to methodological issues,146 the long duration of elevated levels during the postprandial period (>_8 h) results in the arterial wall
being extensively exposed to remnant particles.3,86 Both apoB48and apoB100-containing remnant particles have been identified in
human atherosclerotic lesions.147,148
Taken together, there is evidence for interactive and complementary mechanisms for apoB48- and apoB100-containing remnants in
atherogenesis. Since first proposed,149 increased levels of intestinalderived postprandial lipoproteins have been increasingly recognized
as key players in the development of ASCVD.86,150

Figure 7 Role of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and remnants in atherogenesis. Because of their size (<70 nm), chylomicron remnants, very lowdensity lipoprotein remnants, and intermediate-density lipoprotein can enter the artery wall by transcytosis across the endothelial layer. With
elevated plasma levels, rates of influx exceed egress resulting in accumulation of particles in the subendothelial space. These lipoprotein particles can
adhere to extracellular matrix (proteoglycans), an interaction enhanced by the presence of apolipoprotein (apo) CIII and apoE on the particle surface.
In situ degradation of these particles releases bioactive lipids, which cause endothelial dysfunction and inflammation. Monocyte-macrophages are
recruited from the circulation to clear the deposited lipoproteins, and uptake of cholesterol-enriched lipoproteins leads to foam cell formation and
the appearance of early lesions (A). With repeated cycles of lipoprotein ingress and macrophage migration, a fatty streak is generated (B). Further cellular changes include migration of medial smooth muscle cells into the lesion area. Eventually an unstable complex plaque forms, which upon surface
erosion or mechanical rupture may lead to thrombus formation, and potentially lumen occlusion with an ensuing clinical event. CE, cholesteryl ester;

TRL, their remnants, and ASCVD

Strategic approaches to lowering
of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins
and remnants for atherosclerotic
cardiovascular disease prevention
Key questions
o Are the proatherogenic mechanisms of TRL sufficiently understood
for therapeutic targeting in ASCVD patients with residual risk?
o What are the optimal strategies for reducing ASCVD risk in
hypertriglyceridaemia?
o Are currently available therapeutics targeting pathways that will
result in reduction of cardiovascular risk? What does the future
offer?

Available and novel therapies that target TG metabolism can reduce
TRL plasma concentration but need to be evaluated individually for
impact on atherogenic lipoproteins. Baseline TG level (fasting or
non-fasting), as a reflection of the underlying metabolic abnormality

..
.. (Figure 6), as well as concomitant medications, especially LDL.. lowering drugs, may also influence the potential impact of any ther..
.. apy on ASCVD outcomes. For example, fibrates effectively lower TG
.. across the range of TG levels but only modestly reduce apoB levels.
..
.. Their effects on LDL-C differ between moderate hypertriglyceridae.. mia (LDL-C is decreased or shows no change) and severe hypertri..
.. glyceridaemia (LDL-C is increased, albeit from a low baseline
.. level).163,164
..
Guideline-recommended first steps for managing hypertrigly..
.. ceridaemia are diet modification and weight loss. Dietary goals in..
.. clude (i) avoiding highly refined carbohydrate foods;4,165 (ii)
.. incorporating seafood, particularly fatty fish;166 (iii) increasing
..
.. fibre-rich foods (fruits, vegetables and whole grains);4 (iv) avoid.. ing excess alcohol;167 and (v) substituting mono- and polyunsat..
.. urated fat (mostly from plant oils and nuts) for animal fat (meat
.. and dairy).168 Dietary trans FA increase TG levels minimally but
..
.. should be avoided because they significantly raise LDL-C and
.. lower HDL-C.169 Energy intake should be adjusted to achieve
..
.. and maintain a healthy body weight.
..
The 2019 ESC/EAS guidelines for dyslipidaemia management
..
.. recognize that ASCVD risk is increased at TG levels >1.7 mmol/L
..
.. (>150 mg/dL), but only recommend initiating pharmacotherapy in
.. high-risk patients if >2.3 mmol/L (>200 mg/dL) after excluding sec..
.. ondary causes.20 There are also no treatment goals, either for
.. plasma TG or indices of remnant abundance, given limited evi..
.. dence from randomized controlled trials that lowering TG or TRL
.. reduce ASCVD risk.20 Thus, strategic approaches to lowering
..
.. TRL warrant discussion. This point is especially pertinent given
.. that PESA reported the presence of peripheral atherosclerotic
..
.. plaques in 58% of middle-aged individuals with elevated TG levels
.. (>_1.7 mmol/L), low-to-moderate cardiovascular risk, and high or
..
.. normal LDL-C.38
..
..
.. Inhibiting lipoprotein production
.. Inhibiting secretion of apoB100- and apoB48-lipoproteins may be the
..
.. optimal approach for achieving the reduction of all atherogenic lipo.. proteins. Drugs such as mipomersen [an antisense oligonucleotide
..
.. (ASO) inhibitor of apoB translation] and lomitapide (an inhibitor of
.. microsomal triglyceride transport protein activity) block either apoB
..
.. synthesis or the addition of lipid during chylomicron and VLDL as.. sembly in the intestine and liver, respectively. Both also promote hep..
.. atic TG accumulation and possible development of non-alcoholic
..
.. fatty liver disease, limiting their use to severe hypercholesterol.. aemia.170-173 Novel or combination therapies that inhibit the assem..
.. bly of apoB-lipoproteins and protect against excess intracellular lipid
.. by promoting FA oxidation or decreasing TG synthesis are, there..
.. fore, needed.
..
Reducing TG availability for VLDL assembly represents another
..
.. approach. For example, high-dose omega-3 FA [3-4 g/day, usually the
.. combination of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic
..
.. acid (EPA)] reduces VLDL-TG and apoB secretion by 25-30%,
.. with variable changes in fractional clearance rate.174,175 Some studies
..
.. showed an increase in conversion of VLDL to IDL and LDL, although
.. no change in plasma IDL and LDL levels. Thus, omega-3 FA may have
..
.. limited impact on remnant populations or the total number of

composition after dietary fat absorption.150 Fasting/non-fasting
plasma TG measurement provides a basis for guideline thresholds for
hypertriglyceridaemia.13,20 Non-fasting TG is equivalent, if not superior, to fasting TG in assessing potential ASCVD risk.78,79 If TRL promote plaque development and inflammation predominantly due to
their cholesterol content (either fasting or non-fasting), then TRL
cholesterol might be a superior index of ASCVD risk, either assayed
directly or estimated (Box 5).66,153,154 Estimation of VLDL cholesterol
concentration by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy
analysis was recently proposed as a surrogate for remnant lipoproteins.155 Prospective evaluation of its relationship to MI risk concluded that VLDL cholesterol influenced ASCVD risk similarly to
LDL-C, although as suggested, further validation of NMR-based particle measurement is needed before wider adoption.146
Non-HDL-C, which by definition includes the cholesterol in LDLC, remnants, and lipoprotein(a),79,156 is a simple, robust index of the
total concentration of potentially atherogenic particles in the circulation. Widely recommended by guidelines, non-HDL-C highlights elevated remnants in type 2 diabetes mellitus.20,157 Subtracting directly
measured LDL-C from non-HDL-C provides a crude estimate of
remnant cholesterol content78 but includes cholesterol in TRL not
yet processed to remnants. Assays that specifically measure the cholesterol content of remnant particles have revealed significant associations with ASCVD.17,86 These include the remnant-like particle
assay68,158,159 and a direct assay of TRL cholesterol. Among emerging
approaches, assays of total apoB, apoB100, and apoB48 would offer
direct measures of TRL particle number. In addition, several studies
have indicated that TRL ceramide species may be predictive of cardiovascular events and mortality66,160-162 (Box 5). Finally, readers should
note that the proposed cut-points (Box 1) reflect current knowledge;
further studies are necessary to more accurately relate each category
of hypertriglyceridaemia to risk for ASCVD and/or pancreatitis. It is
reasonable, therefore, to continue to use TG, which is routinely measured in all clinical laboratories, as a surrogate biomarker.

Remnant particles

o 'Remnant-like particle' assay, based on immunoaffinity separation of lipoprotein particles with the characteristics of chylomicron
and VLDL remnants158
o Direct assay, measuring cholesterol content in chylomicrons and VLDL and their remnants (including IDL), i.e. 'TRL cholesterol'.
This was developed with standardization against the equivalent ultracentrifugally isolated fraction (density<1.019 g/mL). TRL that
are not remnants are also captured in this assay159

Emerging approaches
o With one copy of apoB, either apoB48 or apoB100, per particle of TRL and remnants, immunological assay of total apoB in the
Total apoB
fraction comprising chylomicrons, VLDL, and remnants (density <1.019 g/mL) would provide a measure of total TRL (i.e. particle
numbers of chylomicrons, VLDL and their remnants)
o This assay could be refined by complementary estimation of intestinally derived apoB48- and liver-derived apoB100-containing
particles
o With standardization and clinical evaluation, the molar ratio of cholesterol/apoB in this fraction may indicate the degree of cholesterol enrichment and, thus, remnant content and potential atherogenicity
Ceramide species

o There is robust evidence for plasma ratios of ceramide species (e.g. [d18:1/16:0]/ d18:1/24:0] as predictors of cardiovascular
events and mortality
o Given their lipotoxic properties and increased content in the TRL and remnant fraction (density <1.019 g/mL lipoproteins) in
dyslipidaemic subjects, mass spectrometric assay of ceramides in this fraction may inform the putative atherogenicity of the lipidome of TRL and remnants 66,160-162

(Figure 6). Fibrates are the archetypal agents, promoting lipolysis by
increasing LpL activity182 and decreasing the synthesis of apoCIII
(Figure 4), thereby enhancing the efficiency of VLDL clearance.
Whether stimulating lipolysis lowers remnant concentration and
ASCVD risk depends on the efficiency of hepatic uptake pathways. It is
equally uncertain as to whether more efficient lipolysis and increased
conversion of remnants to LDL may be beneficial. Using a Mendelian
randomization approach for LPL variants indicated that those associated with TG-lowering were linked to reductions in ASCVD.26 The
LPLS447X variant that increases enzyme activity has also been linked
to lower ASCVD.183
Outcomes trials with fibrates, other than gemfibrozil, failed to
show clear evidence of reduction in cardiovascular events, although
there was benefit in patient subgroups with raised TG with or without low HDL-C, patients who would be expected to have elevated
remnant levels.184,185 Further insights are awaited from the
PROMINENT trial, in which pemafibrate is being compared to placebo on a background of statin therapy.186
ApoCIII is a known inhibitor of LpL (Figure 4). Indeed, individuals
with LOF APOC3 variants have low plasma TG levels59,60,187 and

basis, 0.46 mmol cholesterol/mmol TG or 0.2 mg/mg). Modifications are available for severe hypertriglyceridaemia or very low

TRL, their remnants, and ASCVD

Enhancing remnant clearance
Increasing the efficiency of removal pathways for atherogenic
lipoproteins should, theoretically, reduce ASCVD risk. Statins upregulate the LDL receptor and would be expected to decrease remnant particles by accelerating their catabolism.145,193 Statin-mediated
TG-lowering is limited at optimal levels of TG (Box 1), but more effective at higher levels (>2.3 mmol/L), with similar percent reductions
in TG and LDL-C.194 Statins also promote chylomicron remnant
clearance and reduce lipaemia following a fat-rich meal.195 Thus, statins can reduce remnant abundance, providing further support for
optimizing their use in individuals most at risk. However, stimulating
receptor-mediated clearance alone is unlikely to address fully the residual remnant-associated risk of ASCVD.
PCSK9 inhibitors increase the activity of LDL receptors and the
clearance rate of IDL in healthy subjects.196 Effects on VLDL clearance are less than with statins, with only modest TG lowering in
hypertriglyceridaemia,197 implying a capacity to reduce plasma levels
of smaller-sized remnants at lower TG levels, but not remnants at
higher TG levels. PCSK9 inhibitors appear to have little effect on chylomicronaemia and apoB48 metabolism.198,199
As previously noted, apoCIII inhibits lipolysis and based on
studies in rodents may also inhibit the hepatic uptake of remnantlike lipid emulsions.74,200,201 An ASO directed against apoCIII
markedly reduced plasma TG levels in subjects lacking LpL activity,188,189 thus providing indirect support for improved hepatic uptake at low plasma apoCIII levels. In contrast, kinetic studies in
humans with either complete60 or partial187 LOF of APOC3
showed markedly increased fractional clearance of VLDL-TG and
apoB and increased conversion of VLDL to LDL without
increased hepatic uptake of remnants. In a mouse model, the effect of reducing apoCIII on hepatic remnant removal was significant only when LpL activity was markedly reduced,75 possibly
explaining the lack of apoB reduction with an apoCIII ASO in
moderate hypertriglyceridaemia.202 These findings offer insights as
to whether simply improving lipolysis-without increasing remnant
removal-will reduce ASCVD risk in people with high TRL levels.
ANGPTL3, another confirmed inhibitor of LpL-mediated lipolysis,
also appears to play a role in non-LpL-mediated clearance of TRL, as
suggested by lowering of TG levels with ANGPTL3 inhibition in a patient lacking APOC2.192 Studies in mice also implicate a role for disinhibited endothelial lipase in stimulating remnant removal by the
liver, independent of the LDL receptor.76,203 Further support is

..
.. This statement highlights two important unmet needs: (i) a standar..

.. (ii) therapeutic options to lower circulating levels of remnants to re..

..
.. The latter is key, because any proatherogenic effects of TRL and rem..

markedly increased in vivo fractional turnover of VLDL-TG with efficient conversion of VLDL apoB to LDL, indicating increased lipolysis.59,187 Of note, an ASO targeting APOC3 markedly reduced plasma
TG levels in severe hypertriglyceridaemia, an effect equally evident in
the absence of LpL activity.188,189
ANGPTL3 is another known inhibitor of LpL activity (Figure 4) and
individuals with ANGPTL3 LOF variants have low levels of TG, LDL-C,
and HDL-C.32,65 Effects on LDL-C, HDL-C, and apoB levels in hypertriglyceridaemic subjects have varied in early trials of a monoclonal
antibody directed against ANGPTL3190 and an ASO therapy that
reduced the synthesis of the protein.191 A single dose of an
ANGPTL3 inhibitor reduced plasma TG levels 40% in a patient deficient in APOC2; this effect persisted for 90 days, implying LpLindependent lowering of TG.192
