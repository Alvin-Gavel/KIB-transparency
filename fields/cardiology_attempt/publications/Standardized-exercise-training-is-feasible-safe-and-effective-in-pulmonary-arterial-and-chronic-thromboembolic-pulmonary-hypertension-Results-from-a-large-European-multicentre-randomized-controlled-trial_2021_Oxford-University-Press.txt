training holds a class IIa level B recommendation in the European
Society of Cardiology/European Respiratory Society (ESC/ERS) pulmonary hypertension (PH) guidelines.9-11
Until the ESC/ERS-guidelines had been published, the sample sizes
of the four randomized controlled studies in pre-capillary PH patients
considered for recommendations on exercise training were quite
small (ranging from 23 to 30 patients). After 2015, two further

Methods
Study population and design
All participating centres were members of a European Respiratory
Society Task Force on exercise training in PH.8 A common protocol was
designed to conduct the first multicentre study on exercise training in
PH. Eleven centres from 10 European countries (Austria, Belgium,
Germany, Italy, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Portugal, Scotland, Spain, and
Switzerland) participated.
Inclusion criteria were pre-capillary PH [PAH or non-operable or recurrent chronic thromboembolic PH (CTEPH)] diagnosed by right heart
catheterization according to the ESC/ERS PH guidelines.9 Study participants had to be >_18 years of age, non-pregnant, in World Health
Organization functional class (WHO-FC) II-IV and stable on optimized
PAH targeted therapy for at least 2 months prior to study enrolment.
Excluded were patients with PAH associated with portal hypertension,
complex congenital heart disease,16 HIV and patients with pulmonary
veno-occlusive disease. Further exclusion criteria were clinically relevant
lung or left heart disease, active liver disease, acute infection, walking disability, haemoglobin concentration below 75% of lower limit of normal
values (individual age and gender adjusted normal values of haemoglobin),
systolic blood pressure <85 mmHg, recent syncope and skeletal or
muscle abnormalities prohibiting participation in an exercise programme.
Patients with sustained supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias at
baseline were not enrolled into the study. Patients with mild nonsustained supraventricular or ventricular arrhythmias or with a history of
arrhythmia, e.g. after cardioversion, were able to participate in the study.
Targeted PAH or other medication was not to be altered within the
training period. The study complies with the Declaration of Helsinki. All
patients gave their written informed consent to the study. The study was
approved by the ethics committee of the Medical Faculty of Heidelberg
University, Germany (S-473/2015) and by each centre's respective ethics
committee. The study was registered in clinicaltrials.gov under the identifier NCT03345212.

..
.. Randomization and outcome measures
.. The study was a 15-week, randomized, controlled multicentre trial. After
..
.. giving written informed consent for this study, patients were randomly
.. assigned to either a 'training group' or a 'control group' using a permuted
..
.. block randomization procedure with sealed envelopes, stratified by
.. centre. Patients of the training group stayed in-house for the initial 10-
.. 30 days of the study period and continued with a programme at home for
..
.. another 11-12 weeks. Patients of the control group stayed at home with
.. usual daily activity. Efficacy parameters were assessed at baseline and after
..
.. 15 weeks by investigators who were blinded to the clinical data.
..
The primary endpoint was the change in 6-min walking distance (6MWD)
.. from
baseline to 15 weeks between exercise training and control group.
..
.. Six-minute walk test was carried out under standardized conditions.17
..
Secondary endpoints were the change from baseline to 15 weeks after re..
.. habilitation in peak oxygen consumption based on a cardiopulmonary exer.. cise testing (CPET), WHO-FC, N-terminal prohormone brain natriuretic
..
.. peptide (NT-proBNP), QoL, and safety parameters. Echocardiography at
.. rest and during exercise and CPET were performed in a smaller subset of
.. centres. Assessment and analysis of QoL (short-form health survey 36, SF-36
..
.. questionnaire) and of other efficacy parameters were performed as
.. described previously.2 Adverse events, defined according to International
..
.. Conference of Harmonization Good Clinical Practice, during the study
.. period were recorded.
..
..
.. Exercise training programme
.. For standardization of the training programme great effort has been under..
.. taken including several meetings of the participating professionals and the
.. implementation of a train the trainer setting. At least one PH expert and
..
.. physiotherapist from each centre spent several days at the PH expert centre
.. and rehabilitation clinic in Heidelberg, Germany between November 2014
..
.. and April 2018 to receive first-hand experience on the set-up of the clinical
.. examinations, patients' exercise capacity evaluation, training adjustment,
.. monitoring, and exercise training components to assimilate procedures
..
.. across countries as much as possible. The 6MWD as primary endpoint was
.. performed standardized according to current recommendations.18 Each
..
.. centre performed a study entrance examination to assess baseline parame.. ters, enabled an inpatient phase between 10 and 30 days followed by an out.. patient phase until the final examination at 15 weeks.
..
..
The exercise and respiratory training was based on published proce.. dures2,3 and adapted by each country to achieve a feasible set-up which
..
.. was similar to the described setting. The Heidelberg exercise training
.. programme specifically developed for patients with PH was chosen as
..
.. intervention due to the profound scientific evaluation of the programme
.. and safety reasons (low intensity). The training programme consisted of
.. respiratory therapy, cycle ergometer training, dumbbell training, guided
..
.. walks, and mental training as described previously.2 During the initiation
.. period, exercise training was performed 5-7 times/week. During the con..
.. tinuation phase at home, training frequency was 3-7 times/week. Training
.. intensity was 40-60% of the patients' achieved maximal workload during
.. ergometer test at baseline. Oxygen saturation, heart rate, right ventricu..
.. lar function at rest and during exercise, and subjective perception were
.. considered for initial training intensity and training adjustment. Right ven..
.. tricular function during exercise was measured by echocardiography as
.. visual estimation of pump function and as change of systolic pulmonary
.. arterial pressure from rest to peak exercise measured during stress echo..
.. cardiography as described previously.19 Pump function was classified
.. qualitatively as normal, mildly, moderately, or severely impaired. Training
..
.. was closely supervised by physical therapists and physicians specialized in
.. rehabilitation medicine and PH experts. Transcutaneous oxygen satur.. ation and heart rate were monitored continuously throughout the train..
. ing. Patients, who were on oxygen therapy 16-24 h/day before inclusion

analysis12-15 have shown that exercise training is highly beneficial for
pre-capillary PH patients. In most previous studies, the initial training
was highly supervised and conducted in an inpatient setting.8,9
Therefore, PH guidelines recommended that exercise training programmes should be implemented by centres experienced in both-
PAH patient care and rehabilitation of compromised patients. In addition, patients should be treated with the best standard of pharmacological treatment and in a stable clinical condition before embarking
on supervised rehabilitation.9 However, the access to such programmes is very limited and multicentre studies are lacking to assess
the effect of exercise training in different countries with different
healthcare systems. Before the start of this trial, rehabilitation was
not available for PH patients in most European countries.
Therefore, the objective of this study was to perform a multicentre,
randomized, controlled trial across Europe also including countries in
which exercise training had so far not been available for PH patients to
investigate its feasibility, safety, and efficacy. Furthermore, we aimed to
develop and assess standardized settings, monitoring, and adjustment
of exercise training which would be helpful to implement a validated,
high-quality programme with a solid scientific evaluation.

into this study remained on oxygen during the training programme. At
discharge at the end of the inpatient phase, patients received an individualized training manual and organized a cycle ergometer for use at home.

Statistical methods
The analyses were performed by a statistician (N.B.). The efficacy analysis
and subject characterization were performed by use of the efficacy dataset including all patients with baseline and follow-up assessment of the
primary endpoint 6MWD. All patients who were enrolled and randomized into the study were included in the safety analysis. Data are given as
mean values +/- standard deviations. For the description of effects changes
in absolute values were calculated. Differences between changes of the
intervention and the control group were calculated and expressed as
'control-group corrected change'.
Calculation of sample size was based on the primary efficacy endpoint
which was defined as the change in 6MWD between baseline and
15 weeks of exercise training between the training and the control group.
To detect a control-group adjusted difference in 6MWD of 30 m, with an
equal standard deviation of 53 m with a power of 80% and a two-sided
significance level of 5%, it was calculated that 50 patients were required in
each treatment arm. Under consideration of the assumed dropout rate
of 20%, the sample size was increased to 63 patients in each group (total
126). The primary efficacy analysis was performed by a t-test with unequal
variances (Welch tests) of changes between groups since the assumption

.. for a covariance analysis was not fulfilled. The frequency of patients with
..
.. increase of 6MWD >_10% and the frequency of patients with increase
.. above 440 m (low-risk category according to ESC/ERS risk stratification)9
..
.. was analysed for interpretation of the primary endpoint.
..
Secondary endpoints were tested with two-sided student's t-tests for
.. unequal
variances. For analysis of categorical data, v2 test was used. No
..
.. imputation strategy was implemented for missing data. A sensitivity ana.. lysis excluding outliers >1.5 of interquartile range was performed for the
..
.. primary endpoint 6MWD and for peak VO2.
..
Safety was analysed descriptively. Adverse events (AEs) during the
..
.. study period included all AEs that started or worsened from baseline until
.. the last visit (15 weeks). As one centre did not report AEs for the control
..
.. group, patients from this centre were excluded from analysis of AEs. All
.. tests were two-sided and P-values <0.05 were considered statistically sig.. nificant. All analyses were carried out with IBM SPSS V25 (IBM Corp.
..
.. Armonk, NY, USA).

Primary endpoint 6MWD
Patients of the training group showed a significant improvement of
the primary endpoint 6MWD (30.7 +/- 57.9 m), while the control
group slightly decreased in 6MWD (-3.4 +/- 25.9 m; control-group
corrected change 34.1 +/- 8.3 m; P < 0.0001, Table 1 and Figure 2). In
the training group, 19 patients (32.3%) had a walking distance improvement >_10%, compared with two patients (3.4%) in the control
group. Twenty-five patients from the training group vs. one patient in
the control group showed a 6MWD improvement above the threshold of clinically important difference >_33 m.
Ten patients of the training group who presented with a walking
distance <440 m at baseline improved their walking distance to >_440
m during follow-up (ESC/ERS low-risk category), three patients
showed deterioration of walking distance below this threshold. In
comparison, one patient from the control group improved walking
distance from <440 m to >_440 m, while three patients showed deterioration below the threshold.

Secondary endpoints
Quality-of-life scores (mental health) significantly improved in the
training group, compared with the control group (control-group corrected change 7.3 +/- 2.5; P = 0.004) and improved in trend for physical
functioning (P = 0.07) and social functioning (P = 0.09; Figure 3). With
Bonferroni correction, P-values <0.005 remained statistically significant for QoL data. Other SF-36 scales and subscales did not significantly differ between groups.
In the training group, nine patients improved in WHO-FC, compared with one patient in the control group; four patients worsened
in WHO-FC, compared with three patients in the control group (v2
P = 0.027).
In CPET peak oxygen consumption significantly improved in the
training group [control-group corrected change th0.9 +/- 0.3 mL/min/
kg; P = 0.048; Figure 4; improvement equals 8.5 +/- 17.6% in the training
group vs. 1.0 +/- 13.8% in the control group (P = 0.015)]. In the training
group, 23 patients (41.8%) had a peak oxygen consumption improvement >_10%, compared with 15 patients (28.3%) in the control group.
Patients in the training group had a significant decrease in systolic
pulmonary arterial pressure (-4 mmHg) compared with the control
group (th5.8 mmHg; difference 9.8 +/- 3.1 mmHg, P = 0.002, Table 2).
Other echocardiographic parameters did not show significant differences between respective changes compared with baseline.

..
Other parameters from CPET and change of NT-proBNP showed
..
.. no significant differences between groups (Table 2).
..
Sensitivity analysis excluding outliers revealed that the primary
..
.. endpoint 6MWD (difference 26.3 +/- 6.5 m, P = 0.0001) and peak VO2
..
.. (difference 0.75 +/- 0.38 mL/min/kg, P = 0.05) still remained statistically
.. significant.
..
..
.. Safety
..
.. The safety set comprised 99 patients, as AEs from one centre
.. (n = 30), which only reported AE data for patients from the interven..
.. tion group, were excluded. In total, 52 AEs (27 training group, 25
.. control group) were reported for 21 patients (13 training group and
..
.. 8 control group). Adverse events with a frequency of >_5% and ser.. ious AEs were comparable between groups (Table 3). The most fre..
.. quent AEs were arrhythmia and respiratory infections. In the training
..
.. group, three patients experienced a serious AE during the study
.. period, compared with one in the control group (v2 P = 0.38). All ser..
.. ious AEs were classified as serious due to occurrence of
.. hospitalization.
..
Patients of the training group showed a higher dropout rate for
..
.. the efficacy dataset (v2 P = 0.095), though three patients successfully
..
.. completed the study, but did not perform a 6MWD due to organiza.. tional issues. No patient in the control group vs. four patients in the
..
.. training group did not complete the study due to AEs, out of which
.. one was a serious AE (decompensated diabetes). However, none of
..
.. the AEs or serious AEs were evaluated to be related to the study
.. intervention.
..
..
..
..
.. Discussion
..
.. This is the first randomized controlled multicentre study on exercise
..
.. training in patients with pre-capillary PH, performed in 11 centres in
.. 10 European countries in a large patient population, showing a signifi..
.. cant and clinically meaningful improvement of the primary endpoint
.. 6MWD and of the secondary endpoints WHO-FC, QoL, and peak
..
.. oxygen consumption. The study showed for the first time that a safe
..
.. and effective exercise training programme can be standardized and is
.. feasible in different countries with different healthcare systems. To
..
.. make this therapy widely available for PH patients participating
.. centres implemented this PH training programme mostly for the first
..
.. time and successfully adapted it to their local healthcare system.
..
..
.. Significant improvement of primary
.. endpoint 6MWD
..
.. The effects of exercise training have so far been investigated by only a
..
.. few working groups, which raised the need for larger and multicentre
.. studies to verify the results.8,12,20
..
Although the 6MWD as outcome parameter has been criticized,
..
.. particularly in add-on treatments,21 we chose this patient-relevant
..
.. outcome to reflect patients' exercise capacity as it has been shown
.. that the 6MWD highly correlates with daily activity, haemodynamics
..
.. and prognosis in PH and is thus used for risk assessment. Change in
.. 6MWD has been reported to be below the clinically relevant thresh..
.. old in several studies, despite significant changes in other relevant
.. outcomes.21 In a meta-analysis, the 6MWD has shown limitations as
..
. surrogate endpoint for clinical worsening events in PAH, but still a

material online, Table S1). Out of them, 116 completed the study
with baseline and follow-up assessment of the primary endpoint
6MWD (58 vs. 58 patients; 73.3% female, 53.6 +/- 12.5 years, 47.5%
WHO-FC >_3, mean pulmonary artery pressure 47 +/- 15 mmHg, pulmonary vascular resistance 8.2 +/- 5.0 WU; Table 1). One patient in
the training group and one patient in the control group had mild impairment of left ventricular function. Right ventricular function was
mildly impaired in 13 vs. 10, moderately impaired in 5 vs. 5, and severely impaired in 3 vs. 2 patients (training vs. control). Reasons for
dropout are given in Figure 1. Mean inpatient training duration was
25 days [95% confidence interval (CI) 17 to 33 days]. Pulmonary
hypertension-specific medication was not changed throughout the
study period. Baseline parameters were well-balanced between
groups (Table 1).

Standardized exercise training is feasible, safe, and effective

Figure 3 Secondary endpoints: quality of life. The secondary endpoint quality of life (QoL) significantly improved in the subscale mental health in
the training group compared with the control group (P = 0.004). Two further subscales were significant in trend (physical function P = 0.07, social
function P = 0.09).

difference of 22.4 m favoured active treatment.22 In our study, clinically relevant improvement in 6MWD was supported by significant improvement of WHO-functional class and peak VO2, which have both
shown to be prognostically important and are included in the ERS/
ESC risk stratification model for PAH. Though 6MWD may not be

directly linked to clinical worsening events, it does represent physical
exercise capacity and may, together with other parameters, be interpreted for risk stratification and QoL.23
Our findings are also in line with previous studies on exercise train12-15
ing in PH8, and confirm the positive results in a multicentre setting

with an inpatient start of exercise training. Moreover, this study is the
largest trial of PH patients undergoing exercise rehabilitation, substantially increasing the number of patients with scientifically evaluated training effects. The improvement of 6MWD by 34.1 +/- 8.3 m
was clinically meaningful and lies above the threshold for clinical importance of 33 m in PH.24 Ten patients of the training group (17.2%)
improved walking distance to the low-risk category, according to
ESC/ERS risk stratification. Mean 6MWD improvement was also
comparable to results of medication studies in PAH,25 and lies above
the results of add-on medication in PAH with mean improvements of
19.96 m (95% CI 15.35-24.57 m).26 The improvement of 6MWD is
slightly lower than reported from other exercise training studies,
which may also be attributed to the multicentricity of this study, the
required adaptation of training protocols. It has already been shown
that patients with high functional impairment, e.g. WHO-FC III and
IV, show the most pronounced benefit by exercise training,27 which
may have influenced the results. As 25/58 patients of the training
group and 26/58 patients of the control group already presented
with 6MWD values >_440 m at baseline, the improvement of walking
distance may well be limited by a ceiling effect.28 Furthermore, exercise training in PH was implemented for the first time in most of the
centres, possibly resulting in suboptimal increase of training intensities, likely resulting in a lower training effect. To this end, the low
number of AEs does support the focus on safety and tolerability of
exercise training in this study.

Improvement of secondary endpoints
Secondary efficacy parameters such as QoL and peak oxygen consumption significantly improved in the training group compared with
the control group. As peak oxygen consumption showed a significant

.. increase, but workload and peak heart rate remained constant, the
..
.. effect may be attributed to an economization of oxygen metabolism
..
.. in the muscles. Patients of the control group improved peak VO2
.. >10% in 29% of cases, which may possibly be attributed to the
..
.. Hawthorne effect, which describes the change of behaviour that
.. occurs in clinical trials due to the awareness of being observed. The
..
.. improvement of physical and mental health parameters in this study
.. underlines the holistic approach of exercise training to enable decon..
.. ditioned PH patients to extend their individual daily activity spectrum.
.. As NT-proBNP was not significantly increased in the training group,
..
.. the exercise training also did not seem to have a negative impact on
.. right heart insufficiency and ventricular load.
..
..
.. Implementation of exercise training in
..
.. different countries
..
.. To implement the standardized training programme mostly for the
.. first time in the respective European countries new collaborations
..
.. were initiated between PH expert centres and rehabilitation centres,
.. funding opportunities were sought as the in-hospital rehabilitation
..
.. was not part of reimbursement schemes of most national insurance
..
.. systems. Thus, this study was the first step to enable a permanent im.. plementation of an exercise training programme for PH patients in
..
.. the respective European countries.
..
..
.. Limitations
.. We cannot exclude a potential inclusion bias whereby patients who
..
.. are willing to undertake an exercise intervention may reflect a more
.. motivated and adherent group. Another limitation of this study is the
..
.. amount of missing data including non-invasive haemodynamics. The
.. number of values included for each parameter is reported to indicate

parameters which need to be interpreted with caution due to missing
data. Especially for haemodynamic changes with exercise training in
PH further data, preferably including right heart catheterization, are
needed.
It is intrinsically not possible to blind a training study. However,
investigators involved in data analysis were blinded as far as possible
including clinical data and QoL assessments. Due to organizational
reasons, not all centres were, however, able to perform blinded
assessments of 6MWD, though the walking distance of previous
assessments was not known to the investigators.
Total number of AEs did not differ between groups, though
patients of the training group had a higher frequency of serious AEs
and a higher dropout rate during the study. None of the AEs or serious AEs were stated to be related to the training intervention.
For safety concerns severely deconditioned patients with very
restricted mobility range were not included in this study. Thus, we
cannot exclude a selection bias towards more active patients.
As most of the patients in the control group were offered to participate in the exercise training programme after having finished their
final examination, long-term data for comparison between exercise
training and control group were not available. No daily physical activity measurements were part of the protocol. Thus, it is not possible
to quantify whether general activity increased after the exercise
training.

Conclusions
This is the first multicentre and the largest randomized, controlled
study so far, reporting the beneficial effects of exercise training on
6MWD, QoL, and oxygen consumption in patients with PH. Study
results are in line with previous studies. Exercise training was successfully implemented in all participating centres, including PH expert
centres as well as experienced rehabilitation facilities. Further large
multicentre studies are needed to investigate the haemodynamic
effects of this intervention on different subtypes of PH.
