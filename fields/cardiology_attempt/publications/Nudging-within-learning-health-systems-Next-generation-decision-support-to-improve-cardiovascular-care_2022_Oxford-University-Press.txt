Graphical Abstract Schematic of a future learning health system with nudge, clinical decision support systems (CDSS), and artificial intelligence-powered analyses forming core parts of the learning cycle. Nudges within the CDSS can be used to either promote better adherence of guideline-directed therapy or test new hypotheses whenever there is clinical equipoise, identified through variation in clinical
practice owing to the lack of robust evidence in that context. Although a simple A vs. B randomized controlled trial choice has been presented (fluid restriction vs. standard of care), multiple arms and an adaptive design could be built. Clinical outcomes could include patientreported outcome measures. The presentation of nudges can be adjusted as new clinical insights are generated either within the local system
or externally through data linkage. ACEi, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor; GDT, guideline-directed therapy.

Nudging within learning health systems: next
generation decision support to improve
cardiovascular care

Nudging within learning health systems

1297

Introduction
Decision-making in healthcare is under increasing scrutiny. As we
enter an age of ubiquitous electronic health records (EHRs), clinical
decision support systems (CDSS), and large, linked data sets with
the potential to accommodate artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms,
the need to better understand individual and collective decisionmaking has reached a critical point. In cardiovascular medicine,
we anchor our decision-making to clinical guidelines. However,
only a minority of recommendations within guidelines is based on
Level A evidence and there remains variation in clinical practice.1
The increasing digitalization of healthcare provides the opportunity
to systematically test and evaluate this variation across healthcare
professionals within a learning healthcare framework.
In this review, we highlight the role of nudge theory and how
better testing and evaluation of nudges as part of a learning health
system (LHS)2 can improve decision-making and patient outcomes. Thaler and Sunstein3 defined nudge in 2008 as 'choice
architecture that alters people's behaviour in a predictable way
without forbidding any options or significantly changing their economic incentives'. While prominent examples include a traffic light
system for the front of pack nutritional labelling (with healthier
food choices in green and unhealthier food choices in red) or
the addition of a 'fly-shaped sticker' in male urinals at Schiphol
airport to reduce cleaning costs,3 nudges in healthcare are less
notable-an example is given in Figure 1.
Despite its popularization over a decade ago, the testing and
implementation of nudges within cardiovascular research and
practice have been scarce compared with traditional topics such
as basic sciences, translational medicine, and multicentre trials.
Most of the literature has developed alongside the mass digitalization of healthcare.5 We, therefore, focus primarily on nudges as
CDSS alerts and associated digital tools such as EHRs as a natural
platform for their delivery. A sketch of the relationships between
nudge, CDSS, and alerts is given in Figure 2.
We draw distinction between the use of CDSS alone and applying nudges as part of their design. For example, while CDSS alerts
are a form of nudging, simple default states within EHRs, e.g. an alphabetized list of medications as part of an electronic prescription
order, are not explicitly 'nudge interventions' unless the design of a
default state is deliberate. However, even incidental designs can

have consequences-in this case, with effects on prescribing patterns.7 A broad classification of nudge types are included as part
of the Supplemental material online, though any aspect of an
EHR-based platform can impact on decision-making. The careful
and explicit study of their design, including nudges, and their influence on clinical behaviour and outcomes has been largely missing.

Nudging in areas with the known
and unknown evidence base
Our central argument is that the routine use of nudges in healthcare can improve decision-making and outcomes through two distinct routes: (i) by reducing the evidence-practice gap through
improved adherence to guideline-directed therapy (GDT) and
(ii) by generating novel insights.
(i) While 'bench to bedside'8 has improved patient outcomes
through the translation of basic science discovery to clinical trials,
this paradigm alone is not enough. By extending the concept 'from
bench to bedside, to patient and population',9 an additional
evidence-practice gap emerges, defined as the suboptimal choices
we make, as providers, policymakers, and also as patients. This can
affect large groups of individuals depending on the context. For
example, in a recent multinational analysis of heart failure prescriptions, fewer than one in five patients achieved target doses
of evidence-based medications.10 Nudges theory can play a central role in bridging this gap.11
(ii) Nudges can also lead to the generation of new clinical
knowledge insights, when deployed in settings of clinical equipoise. Here, the ability of nudges to shape behaviour towards a
more uniform course of action may uncover meaningful effects
on patient outcomes in areas that lack a robust evidence base
and have large variations in current practice. In particular, the
testing of clinician-facing CDSS nudge alerts as interventions as
part of randomized controlled trials will allow the true potential of nudge impact to be realized.
A summary of key considerations in these two scenarios is presented in Table 1, alongside a schematic representation in the
Graphical Abstract.

The increasing volume and richness of healthcare data collected during routine clinical practice have not yet translated into significant numbers of actionable insights that have systematically improved patient outcomes. An evidence-practice gap continues to exist in healthcare.
We contest that this gap can be reduced by assessing the use of nudge theory as part of clinical decision support systems (CDSS). Deploying
nudges to modify clinician behaviour and improve adherence to guideline-directed therapy represents an underused tool in bridging the
evidence-practice gap. In conjunction with electronic health records (EHRs) and newer devices including artificial intelligence algorithms
that are increasingly integrated within learning health systems, nudges such as CDSS alerts should be iteratively tested for all stakeholders
involved in health decision-making: clinicians, researchers, and patients alike. Not only could they improve the implementation of known
evidence, but the true value of nudging could lie in areas where traditional randomized controlled trials are lacking, and where clinical equipoise and variation dominate. The opportunity to test CDSS nudge alerts and their ability to standardize behaviour in the face of uncertainty
may generate novel insights and improve patient outcomes in areas of clinical practice currently without a robust evidence base.

Figure 2 Clinical decision support systems have a broad definition which could include a cumbersome number of entities-for instance, a
poster on a wall could represent a form of clinical decision support. Most published literature of clinical decision support system in medical
journals refers to either explicitly or implicitly a computerized version embedded within electronic health records, ranging in complexity
from a simple reminder alert or highlight of a laboratory result, to default medication listing and dosing.6 CDSS, clinical decision support system;
CPOE, computerized provider order entry; EHR, electronic health record.

The existing evidence for CDSS impact was the subject of a recent meta-analysis-of more than 100 heterogeneous studies analysed, there was a significant 6% improvement in the proportion of
patients receiving desired care.12 However, this work only

examined CDSS use for improving guideline and process adherence. There was a lack of focus given to descriptions of the human-computer interface, including elements such as degree of
clinician involvement and acceptability among different user

overall result, including prominence of choices; predisposition
to social norms; and clinician workflow impacts. Thus within
the limited evidence base, nudge designs have been evaluated
using familiar tools such as randomized controlled trials
(RCTs), though it is the nudge use for guideline adherence that
predominates. Important contextual factors are inconsistently
considered during their implementation.

Nudges as blockbuster
intervention
Evidence-based medicine through international multicentre randomized clinical trials have guided the practice of cardiovascular medicine and generated blockbuster results, ultimately embodied and
communicated in the form of practice-changing guidelines.19-21
However, the lack of attention paid to evaluating the decisionmaking of clinicians and patients represents a significant asymmetry.
As a result, there is an untapped opportunity for our community to
make step change improvements in cardiovascular care, through
greater testing of nudge interventions and their effect on clinical
decision-making. The magnitude of the potential benefits can be
profound, as seen when comparing head-to-head the top-end effect
size of a successful nudge, with the most prominent recent
blockbusters in medicine (Table 2).4,22-24
A key caveat to the above comparison is that most nudge studies report process measures instead of hard clinical outcomes, although the reference for the AF-ALERT study4 included in Table 2
is deliberate. While currently an outlier, it represents a precedent
for future nudge studies to aim for impact on clinical outcomes. A
missing element from the table is that of financial costs and costeffectiveness-an area where nudges deployed within EHRs will
out-compete traditional RCTs many times over.2

Deploying nudges where evidence is known includes in circumstances when they aid guideline-directed therapy. This can be viewed as quality improvement and may form part
of multi-faceted interventions including education of staff, audit, and feedback. Deploying nudges where evidence is not known will generate knowledge and requires clinical
equipoise and randomization in order to generate novel insights which may be generalizable to multiple contexts.

groups. A future LHS will be one which can routinely deploy
nudges within CDSS and better understand why adherence to
their recommendations may vary according to clinician and context. Co-design with frontline clinicians as well as clinical leaders
will be crucial in order to ensure credibility in their testing and
use. In doing so, synchronous progression of our understanding
of the 'user stream of knowledge' and learning from responses
to CDSS nudges,6 can occur alongside increases in knowledge of
disease and use of treatments through EHR-based phenotyping
and variations in clinical practice.13
As clinicians increasingly spend their working lives directly interacting with EHRs and CDSS as part of patient care,14 studies that
examine how to best deploy CDSS alerts and which nudges may
modify clinicians' behaviour in the most effective manner, will be
of increasing value.
As of November 2021, there are 41 systematic reviews registered
on PROSPERO which include 'nudge',15 and only 21 papers returned
from a search of 'nudge' and 'cardiology' on PubMed.16 Of the above
results, only one review was directly related to Cardiology and few
primary research studies used 'nudge' as a term. Current research
practice perhaps reflects 'nudge hesitancy' within the cardiovascular
disease field as well as inconsistency in its definition and reported
use. For example, work may not explicitly be labelled by the term
nudge and the term alert is often used interchangeably.
This contrasts with their potential efficacy on an aggregate level-in a study of Cochrane systematic reviews, 42 trials of nudge
strategies for clinician implementation of guidelines determined
an effect in 86% of studies in the hypothesized direction, with
more than half of those being statistically significant.17
However, a narrower 2021 scoping review which focused on interventions explicitly identified as nudges found 22 studies of
mixed benefit18 with more detailed descriptions of the factors
underpinning study designs that had a significant effect on their

Examples of nudge in the
cardiovascular field
There are several nudge trials within cardiovascular medicine,
though they remain rare. A scoping search for relevant RCTs
was conducted (see Supplementary material online, Appendix
S2). We focus on three selected examples to illustrate key principles relevant for all current and future studies and list additional
relevant studies in Table 3. The REVeAL-HF trial31 represents
the latest addition to the field. Having recruited over 3000 patients
within 1 year at a single healthcare system, the REVeAL-HF team
demonstrated that such pragmatic trials are feasible. The nudge
intervention consisted of changing the choice architecture of the
EHR to display a 1-year mortality risk for patients admitted with
heart failure (modelled from data generated within the EHR).
The hypothesis tested was whether the display of this novel information affected downstream clinical decision-making such as the
use of heart failure pharmacotherapies, onwards referrals to palliative care, and clinical outcomes including rehospitalizations and
1-year mortality. Although the trial demonstrated no overall effect
for the CDSS nudge,41 several aspects of the study are worth noting for future endeavours: the description of CDSS testing to preserve computing speeds of the EHR platform via 'run in' periods;
the detail of the alert design, including features such as font colour
and data visualization; and engagement with clinical teams including pre-trial education at departmental meetings and opportunities
for feedback to optimize the alert design. The ambition to

generate novel insights rather than targeting the more traditional
goal of improved guideline adherence represents a novel contribution in spite of the neutral result. The study authors have speculated that a nudge intervention more closely coupled to clinical
actions could have made a difference to outcomes, rather than
the supply of additional prognostic information alone. One missed
opportunity was the discussion of whether clinicians accepted the
accuracy of the prognostic algorithm within the CDSS alert.
Would clinicians have been more likely to change their behaviour
if they demonstrably trusted the accuracy of the model? Could
trust be improved through a more explainable algorithm?42 And
how can issues of algorithm aversion be planned for in future studies and practice, where professional 'gut instinct' may dominate an
algorithm's (superior) recommendation.43
The issue of trust and understanding of CDSS recommendations
were additionally highlighted by a recent study of nudge alerts on
cardiologists' prescription rates of statins.44 Eighty-two attending
cardiologists were recruited as part of a cluster RCT design.
Regardless of either passive alert (which required manual access)
or an active interruptive alert to accept or decline guidelinedirected statin therapy, there were no significant changes in statin
prescriptions during the 1-year study. The authors commented
that clinicians in the study were unsure regarding the clinical justification behind the CDSS recommendation, emphasizing the influence of clinical teams' cognitive heuristics and baseline models of
working on nudge deployment. Contrastingly AF-ALERT,4 which
also evaluated a CDSS nudge for adherence to GDT demonstrated
a significant difference in anticoagulation prescribing behaviour, and
crucially, clinical outcomes, as highlighted in Table 2. Once more,
clinical context is a key to understand the different trial results-

In terms of widespread testing, previous economic and technical
barriers to studying and deploying nudge on a large scale are
now surmountable. Over 90% of US hospitals had computerized
health records by the mid-2010s25 and globally, lower and
middle-income countries are continuing their progress towards
digitalization.26 The increasing availability and sophistry of EHRs
mean that it is now possible for many more healthcare systems
to not only accurately codify clinical details, but also elements of
human factors that have traditionally been unattended to, such as
quantifying the confidence of decision-making in real time, and
how this may be linked to the selection of a particular diagnosis
or treatment.27 The implications of subsequently using nudges to
steer clinicians towards certain decisions in the face of uncertainty and
to modify them in real time as evidence accumulates of clinician
preferences and clinical outcomes represent novelties that should
form the crux of the future LHS.
Thus, while human factors research in medicine has primarily focused on safety in the form of checklists28 or shift patterns,29 the
ability to test other hypotheses as part of CDSS nudges embedded
within the EHR can now be realized. The challenge will be one of
prioritization, and in which clinical settings CDSS nudges should be
tested first. Just as with the checklist literature, accepting that effects of local context can predominate over replicability of action
would enable us to move beyond the moot 'nudges do/don't work'
commentaries seen within the checklist literature.30

perhaps the patient benefit of anticoagulation and stroke risk reduction were more salient to clinicians than the benefits of a statin prescription. Of note, all three highlighted trials were conducted in the
USA and received ethical approval for waiver of consent.
The feasibility of trial conduct within routine workflows and
end-user acceptability are of particular salience given the trend of
decision-making by clinicians that are increasingly abdicated to diagnostic and therapeutic pathways and protocols. Research questions
such as 'what is the rate of clinician adherence to CDSS and which
factors influence these' will become key hypotheses to test and answer. And while the eye-catching AF-ALERT trial4 demonstrated a
55% reduction in composite clinical outcomes, no details on clinician demographics or local clinical context were reported, tempering the generalizability of such a result.
Overall, nudge remains unfamiliar to the cardiovascular community despite its widespread use in other scientific disciplines and
popular science parlance since 2008. Of all ESC professional guidelines, nudge is mentioned only in passing in the previous 2016 ESC
prevention guideline:32 'Strategies such as "nudging" (to push mildly) and "default" have been proposed as tools. By changing the
context to make healthy decisions the default, the individual is
nudged in the healthy direction'.

Evidence from other contexts
Nudges have influenced clinician behaviour in a variety of other
contexts and several studies stand out45-47 in terms of their generalizability to a cardiology audience (Table 4).
The recurring theme for successful nudges appears to be a
greater focus on understanding the nuances of how physicians
make decisions and how factors such as the Hawthorne effect48

need to be navigated and depending on the context, leveraged,
in order to drive improvements. For cardiologists, comparison
with peers49 may be one strategy to frame nudges to help drive
behaviour change. Presently, the additional factors that can have
an impact on the likelihood of nudge success, such as time constraints and the organizational structure of teams tasked to deliver
nudge interventions, have only a paucity of data to describe their
effects in specific clinical contexts.50

Nudges for patients
Nudges for patients have mainly focused on the intent-behaviour
gap51 and whether communication of healthcare information results in healthier choices. A 2016 meta-analysis examined the effect of presenting individual risk to patients52 and found no
significant effects on smoking cessation, diet or physical activity,
or even motivation to change behaviour. More optimistically, a
2021 pilot study of nudges in the form of text message reminders
for medication refills demonstrated early signals of possible benefit,53 further highlighting the importance of choosing the right context. Follow-up work as part of a larger study which includes
measuring clinical outcomes is now underway.54
Prospective research of patient-facing CDSS nudges will need to
match the growth of health technology companies who offer services to patients, often in a primary prevention cohort.55
Therefore, while current evidence for broad nudge interventions
at a population level is mixed,56 this may soon change over time.
For patients with existing conditions, examples of commitment contracts have shown success-e.g. in adherence to optimal secondary
prevention in the context of heart failure,57 though a systematic review of nudges for patients with chronic disease emphasized the

heterogeneity of study designs, results, and types of nudges.58 While
the platforms that deliver patient-facing nudges can vary considerably, one recent example of a multi-faceted intervention stems
from the EPIC-HF trial40-there was patient choice in receiving a
video and checklist nudge by email, text, or both. The framing of
the intervention encouraged patients to 'promote a conversation
about changing at least one thing to optimize medication management' and 49% in the intervention group received initiation or intensification compared with 30% in the control group.
Therefore, while there are many opportunities, the risk of leaving patient-facing nudge interventions understudied and without
formal regulation will manifest in the unintended consequences
they may have on healthcare systems, with either downstream under or over-medicalization of problems.13

Limitations of nudge
Greater adoption and testing of nudges will require groups to deal
with the following considerations.

Misuse
A key criticism of nudge is misinterpreting the breadth of its use in
addressing areas reserved for wider policy and governmental action. For example, nudge was erroneously framed in the UK as a
panacea for all the challenges set forth in the Marmot review59
of health inequalities in 2011. The over-reliance on simply changing
an individuals' choice architecture ahead of using other policy tools
drew firm criticism from Sundar:60 '...effective sewage systems,
clean running water, workplace safety laws, and smoking bans ...
public health needs to go back to basics and deal with inequity
at a structural level rather than relying on nudge theory to change
individual behaviour'.
A similar critique applies to CDSS-based nudges aimed at clinicians
-we must not forgo the fundamentals of clinician education, audit
and feedback, and other helpful tools that improve clinical knowledge

and patient care. There are also other prominent examples of nudge
misuse. In January 2020, an EHR vendor admitted colluding with an
opioid manufacturer to create a pain alert CDSS which encouraged
physicians to prescribe more extended-release opioid, thus selling
more of the manufacturer's product.61 The true prevalence of political and commercial influences on nudge design is beyond the scope
of this review but these are important to consider in any context.

Lack of reproducibility of effect
size and direction
Changes in behaviour are not entirely predictable-the 'dose' or
'route' of a nudge represent areas of considerable variation whenever they are evaluated and local context in modifying effects can
be key. For instance, there are examples of nudge use that have
resulted in heterogeneous effects. In the setting of alerts for acute
kidney injury, a multicentre RCT which was negative contained signals of harm in some of the study sites that could not be attributed
to a specific process.62 Many have suggested that nudges should be
thought of as inductive rules of thumb which require careful testing
and evaluation, rather than medicinal products with a predictable
mechanism of action and side effect profile.63 Therefore, similar to
when 'health policy reversals' occur, the rapid testing of nudges as
part of RCTs and other experimental designs, tailored to the local
context, will be the only way to effectively prescribe and 'deprescribe' CDSS nudge alerts.64

Lack of standardized nudging and
dataset quality
Clinical decision support systems nudges may be required to work
across multiple different EHR platforms-their recommendations
and delivery will only be as effective as the datasets in which they
are embedded within. Encouragingly, there is progress in moving
towards increased data quality and interoperability, for both data

Studies stretch across medical contexts and also include non-digital platforms but with a generalizable lesson to all EHR-based nudges.

Nudge fatigue and automation bias
Alert or nudge fatigue has been described as a multi-faceted concept that can cause high override rates of CDSS recommendations, through either clinician de-sensitization or cognitive
overload (where too much information is presented).71 In spite
of these risks, in the comprehensive meta-analysis of CDSS by
Kwan et al.,12 only 14% of the trials considered alert fatigue.
While the effect of alert fatigue was non-significant in these studies, the point remains regarding its unknown effect in the majority
of CDSS trials. A better understanding of how and when alert fatigue becomes relevant, and in whom, e.g. senior clinicians vs. trainees, represent gaps in knowledge which require further research.
A starting place will be more studies such which can quantify the
phenomenon through relevant surrogate measures-for example,
a recent pseudorandomized trial of a CDSS alert to improve prescription of GDT medications in heart failure patients reported
the number of alerts needed to change the quality of care-an estimate comparable to the number needed to treat in clinical trial.72
Their results were consistent with a high alert burden-alerts were
triggered an average of over 25 times per hospitalization with a response rate of ,2%. In the trial, 405 interruptive alerts were needed
to be triggered for one additional patient to be discharged on an
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor
blocker. Echoing the lessons from previous trials about context,
the study group introduced a nudge when prescribing performance
was already high (80% prescription rates) and in all hospitalizations, not just those related to decompensation of heart failure.
The mitigation of alert fatigue through tailoring the frequency
and design of nudge alerts may eventually become a growing use
case for AI in healthcare. This contrasts with AI and CDSS alert deployment more generally, where a common vulnerability for clinicians harnessing their power is automation bias. Here, reflexive
adherence to recommendations may also lead to errors and patient harm. As clinicians, preserving the virtues of independent
problem-solving and vigilance in continually asking whether a recommendation from a CDSS should be overridden will become an
essential skill.

Testing nudges
The above limitations could be better accounted for collectively
through the formation of 'nudge units', with a range of roles previously highlighted (Table 5).73
An overarching review of work from nudge units, comparing
published meta-analyses as well as trials run by two of the largest
nudge units in the USA, demonstrated that in 126 studies covering
more than 20 million patients, the average nudge effect size was
between 8 and 34% depending on the context.74 Importantly,
the ability to use different types of nudge designs within a CDSS
-such as harnessing saliency features or modifying default
choices18-as well as using nudges alongside co-interventions
ranging from education to audit and feedback, represent opportunities that require the experience and expertise of multidisciplinary teams, grouped as nudge units, to fully exploit.
Greater collaboration between practising clinicians, academics,
and nudge units could rationalize the application of nudge strategies, stratified according to acute and chronic settings within cardiovascular medicine. Here the experience of clinicians may offer
fundamental principles for good nudge design and appropriate
choice contexts. For example, in an urgent clinical scenario, a
CDSS alert may be ignored and multiple choices of action may
be distracting.
Meanwhile, in a chronic setting, greater nuance and weighting
towards patient preference may predominate and clinician bandwidth could stretch to considering multiple alerts if appropriate
to their workflow. Further use cases of nudge could emerge to
bridge notable gaps in traditional cardiovascular research-for instance, helping to promote better documentation of patientreported outcome measures, an area that EHR vendors are already facilitating.75
The evolving science of measuring EHR use, and exploiting automated data log capture at scale, means that additional and parallel
research questions may be answered. This could include assessing
how tailored nudges could be used to reduce unwarranted variation in EHR use among clinicians. For example, in one study, female ambulatory physicians across specialty disciplines spent 33
more minutes in the EHR per day than male physicians (102.2
vs. 68.8 min).76

Nudges in areas of practice with
clinical equipoise
Perhaps the most impactful areas for the testing of future nudges
rests with identifying scenarios where there is significant variation
in practice among clinicians. Such variation may either be warranted or unwarranted. The latter is the target for quality improvement efforts and where most nudges currently operate, while the
former represents the signature of equipoise being present. A lack
of robust evidence base to inform best practice may represent the
ideal opportunity context needed for pragmatic trials of nudge interventions. The use of CDSS nudges to systematically test one set
of actions, as part of an RCT compared with the heterogeneous
standard of care, may generate novel insights. One example could
be the threshold at which potassium or magnesium is

and CDSS use. For example, Substitutable Medical Apps, Reusable
Technology, Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources, the
Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership common data model, and Guideline Definition Language v2.65-67 Rather than a uniform, homogeneous nudge across different EHR platforms, the
process and function of nudges could be standardized, rather
than their precise form.68 Thus for computerized nudges, instead
of designing a single set of CDSS code, adaptations to different
EHR platforms to retain a standardized set of functions may be required. This review has deliberately focused on the technological
frontier. However, a pre-requisite for deploying effective CDSS
nudges is the digital maturity of the healthcare system, including
its EHR platform as well as broader connectivity-digital maturity
frameworks have been proposed before and can help policymakers identify gaps to work on.69,70 Co-funding of EHR adoption
in combined research and clinical budgets may accelerate system
maturity.

supplemented in the context of acute arrhythmia and low-normal
values.77 For cardiologists, the scale of the opportunity may be significant, given that only a minority of recommendations in the current AHA or ESC guidelines is informed by Level A evidence.1,78
Further, if and when insights are generated, there could be the virtuous cycle of nudge use in studying the adoption of such knowledge generation and by wider extension, implementation of
professional guidelines. In a recent meta-analysis of studies which
embedded appropriate use criteria specified by the American
College of Cardiology into routine clinical workflows, none used
nudges.79
As an extension, nudge testing in the context of clinical equipoise should not necessarily default to traditional two-arm RCT
designs-an adaptive trial design should be explored by every
learning hospital and health system of the future.80 One example
is NUDGE-EHR, which initially includes 16 treatment arms and
seeks to determine which form of nudge is superior at reducing
the prescription of high-risk medications (benzodiazepines, Z
drugs, and anticholinergics) among older adults.81
Ensuring an open dialogue with patients will be key to studies of
the future-increasing awareness of the degree of variation of clinician decision-making alongside the benefits and risks of being involved in pragmatic research, and randomization at the point of

Personalized nudging and risk
tolerance
As partnerships between cardiovascular science and computer science grow, ambitious visions of digital twins83 and AI-powered informatics consults84 may one day be realized. There will be
fundamental changes to working in medicine as well as how medicine will work. Although the application of AI to healthcare is still
in its infancy,85 the increased testing of AI algorithms as part of
AI-CDSS and the role of nudge to maximize their intended 'dose'
will represent forthcoming research priorities.
Extensions to personalized nudging for both clinicians and patients alike may occur, with individualized communication of risk
an area that could change the current consent landscape as applied
to medical procedures.86
Alongside these research questions and the formation of nudge
units, the requirement for interdisciplinary training programmes
for clinical researchers and more ambitious funding programmes
from policy makers, such as the ARPA programme in the UK,
will be key.87 Fostering collaborations throughout the careers of
practicing cardiologists and domain experts responsible for nudge
design and human-computer interfaces will avoid artificial gaps
being created between nudge theory and nudge practice.7,88
While our review is not intended to make a forecast about how
successful nudges could change the practice of cardiology in the
years to come, by adopting rapid cycle testing,89 their 'blockbuster'
potential may not look like the traditional 'one size fits all' tablet or
procedure that we are used to. Instead, nudges applied universally
would be shaped by local practice patterns and idiosyncrasies so
that a 'thousand flowers bloom' model,90,91 with precise nudge effects varying by local context materializes. As more data become
curated, linked, and ingested into (AI)-CDSS models,82 nudges will
become increasingly sophisticated through their (automated) deployment by 'electronic health engines' rather than EHRs-integrating factors including social and economic drivers of health,
behavioural risks, genomic, and citizen-generated data.92

Conclusion
In the age of LHSs and progressive advancements in data science,
the testing of nudge-based interventions for clinicians and patients
alike represents a rich opportunity to systematically reduce
evidence-practice gaps as well as generate new evidence that
could improve care in many areas of cardiovascular medicine
and beyond. Increasing collaborations and opportunities for doctors and researchers to work across professional boundaries will
help facilitate collective, bespoke nudge trials that could deliver
blockbuster results, an outcome that is increasingly hard to observe in traditional RCT designs.

scope of this review but represent areas for future work, particularly at the human-computer interface with future AI (AI-CDSS).82
