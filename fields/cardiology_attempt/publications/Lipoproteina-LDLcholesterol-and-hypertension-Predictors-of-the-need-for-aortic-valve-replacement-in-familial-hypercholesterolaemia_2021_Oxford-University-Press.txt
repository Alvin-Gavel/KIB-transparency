Aims

Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) and elevated lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] are inherited disorders associated with premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Aortic valve stenosis (AVS) is the most prevalent valvular
heart disease and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and Lp(a) may be involved in its pathobiology. We
investigated the frequency and predictors of severe AVS requiring aortic valve replacement (AVR) in molecularly
defined patients with FH.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
SAFEHEART is a long-term prospective cohort study of a population with FH and non-affected relatives (NAR).
and results
We analysed the frequency and predictors of the need for AVR due to AVS in this cohort. Five thousand and
twenty-two subjects were enrolled (3712 with FH; 1310 NAR). Fifty patients with FH (1.48%) and 3 NAR (0.27%)
required AVR [odds ratio 5.71; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.78-18.4; P = 0.003] after a mean follow-up of 7.48
(3.75) years. The incidence of AVR was significantly higher in patients with FH (log-rank 5.93; P = 0.015). Cox regression analysis demonstrated an association between FH and AVR (hazard ratio: 3.89; 95% CI: 1.20-12.63;
P = 0.024), with older age, previous ASCVD, hypertension, increased LDL-CLp(a)-years, and elevated Lp(a) being independently predictive of an event.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
The need for AVR due to AVS is significantly increased in FH patients, particularly in those who are older and have

previous ASCVD, hypertension, increased LDL-CLp(a)-years and elevated Lp(a). Reduction in LDL-C and Lp(a) together with control of hypertension could retard the progression of AVS in FH, but this needs testing in clinical
trials.

Introduction
Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is a co-dominant
disorder with an estimated population prevalence of 1 in 250 and the
most common inherited cause of premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).1 Degenerative aortic valve stenosis (AVS)
is the most prevalent form of valvular heart disease and the most
common indication for surgical or transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).2,3 AVS has been well described in patients with homozygous FH,4 but its development and, in particular, its clinical
sequelae are less clear in heterozygous FH.
The development of AVS is closely related to atherosclerosis, with
common predisposing factors, including hypertension, diabetes, current smoking, and hypercholesterolaemia.5-7 Mendelian randomization data testify to causal roles of elevated low-density lipoproteincholesterol (LDL-C) and lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] in the development
of AVS.7-10 Accordingly, these lipoproteins may conjointly contribute
to the initiation and propagation phases of the AVS that involve lipid
infiltration, inflammation, fibrosis, and calcification; this is especially
relevant to patients with FH.10-12 A major role of Lp(a) and oxidized
phospholipids on progression of AVS and need of aortic valve replacement (AVR) has been reported.13
Prospective registry data afford the best opportunity to explore
the frequency of AVS and need for valvular replacement in patients
with FH. We have previously utilized the SAFEHEART (Spanish

Variables

Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS version 18.0. Variables
were analysed for a normal distribution with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov
test. A descriptive analysis was carried out to report the number of cases
and percentages for the qualitative variables, the mean and the standard
deviation for the quantitative variables that followed a normal distribution
and the median and interquartile range for the quantitative variables that
did not follow a normal distribution. Comparisons of proportions between the qualitative variables were carried out using the Chi-square test
and the binomial test to compare the proportion observed in each treatment group with the value of the total population. The mean comparisons of the quantitative variables were analysed with the Student's T-test

for independent data, and the medians comparisons were analysed with
the Mann-Whitney U test for independent data. Patients with AVR before enrolment were excluded for the survival analysis. Cumulative survival curves were constructed according the Kaplan-Meier method. Logrank test was used to compare survival curves. Uni- and multivariate Cox
regression analyses were used to determine factors predictive of AVR
and to elucidate the role of each variable of the SAFEHEART risk equation. Variables with a P-value <0.05 in the univariate analysis were
included in the multivariate model. A value of P < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.

Results
A total of 5022 subjects were enrolled, 3712 with a genetic diagnosis
of FH and 1310 NAR (Figure 1). Patients younger than 18 years who
underwent AVR due to infective endocarditis or patients with bicuspid aortic valves were excluded. Fifty patients with FH (1.48%) and 3
NAR (0.27%) required AVR [odds ratio 5.71; 95% confidence interval
(CI): 1.78-18.4; P = 0.003]. Among those, 12 patients with FH and no
NAR underwent AVR before enrolment in the registry. Forty-three
(86%) and 7 (14%) patients with FH underwent surgical AVR and
TAVR, respectively. Two (66.7%) and 1 (33.3%) NAR underwent
surgical AVR and TAVR, respectively. Seventeen patients with FH
underwent simultaneous AVR and coronary revascularization (15
coronary artery by-pass graft and 2 percutaneous coronary revascularization), all of them having severe AVS and revascularization based
on the finding of significant coronary lesions on angiography prior to
surgery. The mean follow-up from enrolment into the registry to
AVR was 7.48 (3.75) years: 7.49 (3.85) years for patients with FH and
7.46 (3.42) years for NAR. All patients with FH who underwent AVR
had a mutation in LDL receptor; none had demonstrable mutation in
APO-B or PCSK9.
The characteristics of the cohort are described in Tables 1 and 2.
The frequency of AVR in patients with FH, before and after enrolment, was 1.48% and in NAR 0.27%. Patients with FH tended to be
younger than their NARs at AVR [67.72 (10.43) vs. 79.33 (5.77)
years, P = 0.063], but there were only three AVR in among the NAR.
ASCVD was more frequent in patients with both FH and AVR than in
patients with FH without AVR (64% vs. 14.6%, P < 0.001), not being
present in any NARs with AVR. Coronary heart disease was also
more frequent in patients with FH and AVR than in those with FH
without AVR (46% vs. 12.5%, P < 0.001). There were no significant
differences in the prevalence of LDL receptor null mutations between FH patients with and without AVR (46% vs. 41.8%, respectively; P = 0.55).
The prevalence of hypertension was significantly higher in patients
with FH and AVR than in those with FH and no AVR: 25 (50%) and
496 (14.90%), respectively (P < 0.001). Hypertension was also higher
in NAR and AVR compared with NAR without AVR. Plasma Lp(a)
concentration, LDL-C-years, and LDL-CLp(a)-years were significantly
higher in patients with FH and AVR than in patients with FH without
AVR. Finally, the 10-year cardiovascular risk estimated in patients
with FH using the 10-year SAFEHEART-RE was significantly higher in
patients with FH and AVR than in patients with FH without AVR:
11.48% (11.2) vs. 3.15% (4.81), respectively (P < 0.001).
There were no statistically significant differences among groups in
gender, prevalence of null mutations, tobacco smoking, total

Demographic and clinical variables, age, classic cardiovascular risk factors,
physical examination, and lipid-lowering treatment were included. LDL-C
was estimated by means of the Friedewald formula. Baseline (without
treatment) LDL-C was estimated.18 Lp(a) was quantified using an isoform
independent assay [Quantia Lp(a) 7K00-01; Tulip Diagnostics, Bambolim,
India] and an Architect autoanalyzer C16000 (Abbott Diagnostics, Lake
Forest, Illinois) that was calibrated using the International Federation of
Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) reference apo(a) standard (IFCC/SRM 2B).
Inter-assay variation was <7%.15 The lipid profile, including Lp(a), was
determined in venous blood samples in a centralized laboratory.
Adjustment of LDL-C by cholesterol content of Lp(a) [LDL-CLp(a)] was
made by using a modified version of the Friedewald formula [LDL-CLp(a)
= TC - HDL-C - TG/5 - (Lp(a)  0.45)] that assumed that 45% of Lp(a)
mass in mg/dl was cholesterol. LDL-C-year score was calculated as previously described.19 LDL-CLp(a)-year score was calculated in the same
way, using the estimated LDL-CLp(a) instead of LDL-C.20 LDL-C-year
score and LDL-CLp(a)-year score were divided by 100 units to make the
results more easily interpretable. The genetic diagnosis of FH was performed as published elsewhere.21 Cardiovascular risk was assessed by
the SAFEHEART-Risk Equation (SAFEHEART-RE).22 The classification of
lipid-lowering therapy was defined as previously reported.23
Aortic valve replacement was defined as the need for mechanical (surgical or transcatheter replacement) treatment due to severe symptomatic AVS according current guidelines, including an estimated aortic valve
area <0.9 cm2.2,3 Incident AVR during follow-up was present if it
occurred after enrolment of the patient in the registry. Patients who
underwent AVR due to any other condition different from degenerative
AVS were excluded from the analysis. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease was defined as the presence of any of the following: (i) myocardial infarction: proved by at least two of the following: classic symptoms,
specific electrocardiographic changes, and increased levels of cardiac biomarkers; (ii) angina pectoris: diagnosed as classic symptoms in combination with at least one unequivocal result of one of the following:
exercise test, nuclear scintigram, dobutamine stress ultrasound scan, or
>70% stenosis on a coronary angiogram; (iii) percutaneous coronary
intervention or other invasive coronary procedures as indicated by his/
her treating physician; (iv) coronary artery bypass grafting; (v) ischaemic
stroke demonstrated by computed tomography or magnetic resonance
scanning scan or documented transient ischaemic attack; (vi) peripheral
arterial disease: intermittent claudication, which was defined as classic
symptoms and at least one positive result of an ankle/arm index < 0.9 or
stenosis > 50% on angiography or ultrasonography or abdominal aortic
aneurism; (vii) peripheral arterial revascularization: peripheral artery bypass grafting or percutaneous transluminal angioplasty.

and triglycerides were significantly higher in patients with FH without
and with AVR, respectively. Furthermore, cholesterol lowering treatment was more intensive in FH patients and AVR than in those without AVR.

Incidence of aortic valve replacement in
patients with familial
hypercholesterolaemia and non-affected
relatives
Figure 2 shows the cumulative survival curves for AVR in patients
with FH and NARs during the follow-up period, showing that the incidence of AVR was statistically significantly higher in patients with FH
(log-rank 5.93; P = 0.015). Cox regression analysis also demonstrated
the association between FH and AVR [hazard ratio (HR): 3.89; 95%
CI: 1.20-12.63; P = 0.024]. Time of risk exposure for patients with FH
was 22 036.85 patients-year, with an incidence rate of AVR of 1.7 for
1000 patients-year; time of risk exposure for NAR was 7766.34
patients-year, with an incidence rate of AVR of 0.39 for 1000
patients-year. Hence, the incidence rate of AVR was 4.36 times
higher in patients with FH than in NAR.

When affected family members of index cases with FH were analysed, the multi-variable analysis showed similar results to those using
the entire FH population. The independent predictors for AVR in the
final multi-variable model of affected family members of index cases
with FH were: Age (HR: 1.58; 95% CI: 1.012-1.105; P = 0.012), previous ASCVD (HR: 6.49; 95% CI: 2.08-20.28; P = 0.001), hypertension
(HR: 3.25; 95% CI: 1.17-8.90; P = 0.023), Lp(a) mg/dL (HR: 1.014;
95% CI: 1.008-1.02; P < 0.001), and LDL-CLp(a)-years/100 (mg-year/
dL) (HR: 1.009; 95% CI: 1.001-1.018; P = 0.04).

Discussion
Based on data from a long-term follow-up cohort, we found that heterozygous FH was associated with a markedly increased need for
AVR due to severe AVS. Specifically, we observed a 5.71-fold increase in the need for AVR in patients with FH compared with
NARs. Increasing age, previous ASCVD, hypertension, higher LDLCLp(a)-years, and elevated plasma Lp(a) concentrations were independent predictors of the need for AVR.
The development of AVS is a well-recognized problem to occur in
patients with homozygous FH.4 This is less common in patients with
heterozygous FH. In a recently study, Ten Kate et al.7 demonstrated
increased aortic valve calcification in asymptomatic patients with heterozygous FH compared with controls. In a large Mendelian randomization study, genetic predisposition to high LDL-C was associated
with increased risk of aortic valve calcification and AVS.8
Furthermore, Mundal et al.5 reported that increased LDL-C due to
FH increases the risk of severe AVS and AVR. Our study extends
these findings by using a longer term follow-up period of a real-life
cohort and showing the factors predictive of the need for AVR in
patients with heterozygous FH. Prospective registry data, such as
those from the SAFEHEART study, afford the best opportunity to

explore the frequency of AVS and need for valvular replacement in
patients with FH. The incidence rate of AVR was 4.36 times higher in
patients with FH than in NARs and the average incidence in the present study of AVR in patients with FH was 1.7 cases for 1000
patients-year compared with a corresponding incidence of 7.7-fold
for ASCVD.24
We showed that AVS in FH was associated with sustained elevation in plasma LDL-C concentrations, as reflected by LDL-CLp(a)years, but also with age, previous ASCVD, hypertension, and elevated
Lp(a). Given these five risk predictors, we propose that the use of the
SAFEHEART risk equation22 may offer a simple and pragmatic first
approach to identify patients with FH at risk of ASCVD and in turn
greater predisposition to severe AVS requiring AVR. These five risk
factors are important for understanding the pathogenesis of AVS in
FH: increasing age is a degenerative biological factor, hypertension a
haemodynamic factor, and elevated Lp(a) and LDL-CLp(a)-years two
metabolic factors. All of them were also related to the development
of ASCVD. Mendelian randomization data show that elevated LDL-C
and Lp(a) both contribute to the development of AVS8-10; this
involves lipid infiltration, inflammation, fibrosis, and calcification.6,12 A
major impact of Lp(a) per se on progression of AVS has been supported by several studies; mechanisms include valvular deposition of
oxidized phospholipids, autotaxin-mediated generation of phosphatidic acid, activation of the nuclear factor-kB inflammatory cascade,
and calcification due to induction of alkaline phosphatase.12 Faster

progression of AVS and need for AVR are directly dependent on elevate Lp(a) and specifically the particle content of oxidized phospholipids.12,13 Regrettably, no treatment has shown to be efficacious in
reducing progression of aortic stenosis. Nevertheless, a preventive
screening based on the SAFEHEART-RE affords an opportunity to
explore whether early control of the modifiable risk factors identified
in this study may be useful in diminishing progression of AVS in
patients with FH. While this needs to be tested in prospective trials
with appropriate interventions and imaging endpoints, it is noteworthy that the more advanced stages of AVS may be refractory to
interventions targeted at the modifiable risk factors which we have
identified.
Furthermore, this crucial role of Lp(a) could explain the limited effectiveness of the cholesterol-lowering therapy on calcific aortic stenosis,25-28 given that statins and ezetimibe lower plasma levels of LDLcholesterol but not Lp(a). Statins may also increase Lp(a),26,29 which
could in part account for the lack of effect of such an intervention on
the progression of AVS.27,28 On the other hand, in our study, LDL-C
levels were not associated with the need for AVR due to AVS. A potential explanation for this finding is that the estimated LDL-C contains the Lp(a)-cholesterol, which can account for up to 45% of the
estimated LDL-C.10 Consistent with this, in an exploratory analysis of
the FOURIER trial, higher Lp(a) levels, but not Lp(a)-corrected LDLC levels, were associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular events,
including aortic valve replacement.30 Specific management of elevated Lp(a) remains a therapeutic challenge. PCSK9 inhibitors and
specific therapies that lower Lp(a) are required to address the residual risk attributed of ASCVD and AVS in FH.29,31 Recently, profound reductions in Lp(a) levels have been achieved with apo(a)
antisense therapy that targets hepatic apo(a) mRNA and safely
reduces Lp(a) concentrations by up to 92.4% in patients with and
without established cardiovascular disease, at least in shorter term
trials.32,33 It is noteworthy that patients in the present study who subsequently required AVR were more intensively treated at enrolment.
This may be related to a higher pre-treatment LDL-C and the fact
that statins and ezetimibe do not lower elevated plasma concentrations of Lp(a).27,28 Future studies should assess the relationship between Lp(a) and rates of progression of AVS and the response to
specific Lp(a)-lowering therapy.33
The results of the present study may lead to a new paradigm for
managing patients with FH centred on preventing the development

.. since in the absence of a mid-systolic murmur, significant valvular

.. need to decide on the definition (anatomic or functional) severe
..
.. AVS, which can be subject to imprecision.2,3 Furthermore, using AVR

..
.. on the final stage of the disease, and not an early stage that is influ..

.. Conclusion
..
..
.. The need for AVR due to severe AVS is significantly increased among

.. age, previous ASCVD, hypertension, elevated LDL-CLp(a)-years, and
.. elevated Lp(a) concentration. Improved control of hypertension and

Corrigendum to: CaMKII inhibition reduces electrical activation heterogeneities caused by mechanical stretch in the myocardium
https://doi.org/10.1093/ehjci/ehaa946.3703

In the originally published version of this article, there was an error in the title. The title referred to: "Calmodulin/CAMKII inhibition
reduces electrical activation heterogeneities caused by mechanical stretch in the myocardium". This has now been corrected to: "CaMKII
inhibition reduces electrical activation heterogeneities caused by mechanical stretch in the myocardium".
In addition, the term "CAMKII" has been revised to read: "CaMKII".
These revisions have now been made to the article online.
