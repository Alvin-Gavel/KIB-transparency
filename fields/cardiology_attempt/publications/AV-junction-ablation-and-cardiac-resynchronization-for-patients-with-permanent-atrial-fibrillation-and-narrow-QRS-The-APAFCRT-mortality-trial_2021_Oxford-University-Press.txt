Aims

In patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF), strict and regular rate control with atrioventricular
junction ablation and biventricular pacemaker (Ablation th CRT) has been shown to be superior to pharmacological
rate control in reducing HF hospitalizations. However, whether it also improves survival is unknown.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
In this international, open-label, blinded outcome trial, we randomly assigned patients with severely symptomatic
and results
permanent AF >6 months, narrow QRS (<_110 ms) and at least one HF hospitalization in the previous year to

Ablation th CRT or to pharmacological rate control. We hypothesized that Ablation th CRT is superior in reducing
the primary endpoint of all-cause mortality. A total of 133 patients were randomized. The mean age was
73 +/- 10 years, and 62 (47%) were females. The trial was stopped for efficacy at interim analysis after a median of
29 months of follow-up per patient. The primary endpoint occurred in 7 patients (11%) in the Ablation th CRT arm
and in 20 patients (29%) in the Drug arm [hazard ratio (HR) 0.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.10-0.65;
P = 0.004]. The estimated death rates at 2 years were 5% and 21%, respectively; at 4 years, 14% and 41%. The benefit of Ablation th CRT of all-cause mortality was similar in patients with ejection fraction (EF) <_35% and in those
with >35%. The secondary endpoint combining all-cause mortality or HF hospitalization was significantly lower in
the Ablation th CRT arm [18 (29%) vs. 36 (51%); HR 0.40, 95% CI 0.22-0.73; P = 0.002].

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusions
Ablation th CRT was superior to pharmacological therapy in reducing mortality in patients with permanent AF and
narrow QRS who were hospitalized for HF, irrespective of their baseline EF.

Introduction
Patients with permanent atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure
(HF) are often treated with pharmacological rate control.
Control of the ventricular rate can result in the significant resolution of HF. However, the optimal rate control in patients with
AF and HF is unknown. Not only rapid heart rate but also the irregularity contributes to symptoms and possibly to impaired
prognosis.1 Atrioventricular (AV) junction ablation, by slowing
and regularizing the ventricular rate, has been shown to improve
symptoms, quality of life, and cardiac function, as judged by both
physiological and structural measurements. It has been recognized that while rate control is achieved with AV junction ablation, ventricular dyssynchrony caused by permanent right
ventricular pacing may adversely affect left ventricular function
and interfere with the salutary effects of rate control and rate
regularization.2,3 Biventricular pacing may counteract the adverse
effects of non-physiological right ventricular pacing.4,5 The Ablate
and Pace for Atrial Fibrillation-cardiac resynchronization therapy (APAF-CRT) trial involved patients with severely symptomatic permanent AF and narrow QRS and consisted of two
consecutive (overlapping) phases, i.e. morbidity trial and mortality trial. The morbidity phase was designed to test the hypothesis
that AV junction ablation and biventricular pacing are superior to

... pharmacological rate control therapy in reducing symptoms of
.. HF and hospitalization for HF.6

Trial population

Trial intervention
Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 fashion to AV junction ablation
and biventricular pacing (plus defibrillator according to guidelines7)
(Ablation th CRT arm) or optimal pharmacological rate control therapy
(plus defibrillator according to guidelines) (Drug arm). A randomly
permuted-block randomization list was generated by computer at a central location and was stratified by centre and by baseline ejection fraction
(EF) (<_35% and >35%).
In the ablation arm, right-sided AV junction ablation was attempted
first; the left-sided approach was added if right-sided ablation failed to
achieve persistent third-degree AV block. Repeated ablation procedures
were recommended during follow-up if regression of AV block had
occurred.
Any commercially available CRT-P or CRT-D device was permitted.
The right ventricular lead was positioned in the right ventricular apex.
The left ventricular lead was targeted to the basal-mid portions of the
free wall. No atrial lead was implanted. The final programming of the
implanted device was left to the physicians' discretion. Defibrillator backup was chosen at the discretion of the physicians according to ESC guidelines.7 System reprogramming was recommended during all follow-up visits if persistent capture was not obtained.
Cardiac resynchronization therapy device implantation and ablation
procedures were performed as soon as possible after randomization and
within a maximum time of 30 days. Pharmacological HF therapy was optimized according to current guidelines in both arms. In the control arm,
the rate control therapy was optimized to achieve a resting heart rate of
<110 b.p.m.8

Endpoints
The primary endpoint was time to all-cause mortality. Secondary endpoint was time to the composite of all-cause mortality or hospitalization
due to HF, whatever came first. Hospitalization for HF was defined as a
hospital admission that was associated with an overnight stay owing to
the occurrence of increasing symptoms of chronic HF, which necessitated a substantial increase in diuretics and/or appropriate treatment for
uncontrolled intolerable AF-related symptoms.
Events were collected by investigators by means of a web-based electronic system and the primary and secondary clinical outcomes were
adjudicated by a Clinical Events Committee, whose members were unaware of the patients' study-group assignments. The primary and secondary clinical outcomes were analysed according to the intention-to-treat
(ITT) principle.

.. Data analysis
..
.. Continuous data are shown as mean +/- standard deviation or median

.. Kaplan-Meier product limit technique was used to build the survival

.. curves of each study groups. Log-rank test was used to test the difference
.. between groups. Moreover, the hazard ratios (HRs) of treatment alloca.. tions and their 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were estimated by

.. arm) resulting in a HR of 0.30, 95% CI 0.06-1.50; P = 0.147. Based on the

.. HR, with a sequential design, we estimated that with 32 adjudicated pri.. mary endpoint events, the mortality phase would have 80% power to de..

.. value of 0.029 is needed to stop the trial. On 3 February 2021, the Data

Recruitment began in October 2014. As per protocol, recruitment continued after the termination of the morbidity phase and follow-up continued up to 4 years in the APAF-CRT Long-Term Outcome Randomized
Clinical Trial (Mortality phase). The mortality phase was conducted in 11
European hospitals from October 2014 till to December 2020. Patients
were followed up for a maximum period of 4 years, during which yearly
visits were performed. We enrolled patients with the following inclusion
criteria: severely symptomatic permanent AF (>6 months), which has
been considered unsuitable for AF ablation or in which AF ablation had
failed; narrow QRS (<_110 ms); and at least one hospitalization for HF in
the previous year. Details regarding exclusion criteria are provided in the
Supplementary material online, Table S4.

the drug group than in the Ablation th CRT group after optimization
period, P = 0.002.
In the Ablation th CRT arm, the median time from randomization
to CRT implantation was 4 days (IQR 1-13) and to AV junction ablation was 6 days (IQR 3-29). A defibrillator back-up was given to 26
patients in the Ablation th CRT arm (i.e. a CRT-D device) and to 20
patients in the Drug arm (i.e. an ICD device), P = 0.15; their mean EF
was 31% and 32%, respectively.
Eighteen patients in the Drug arm crossed over to the
Ablation th CRT arm (Figure 2). Of these, 16 crossed over because
they had reached the endpoint of HF hospitalization and, as per
protocol, they were permitted to perform AV junction ablation and
CRT pacing. According to the ITT principle, these patients were analysed in the Drug arm.

Intervention
The median duration of follow-up was 29 (range 1-56) months. The
primary endpoint all-cause mortality occurred in 7 patients (11%) in
the Ablation th CRT arm and in 20 patients (29%) in the Drug arm
(HR 0.26, 95% CI 0.10-0.65; P = 0.004) (Table 2 and Figure 3A). The
estimated death rates at 2 years were 5% and 21%, respectively, and
at 4 years, 14% and 41%.
The secondary endpoint consisting of all-cause mortality or HF
hospitalization, whatever came first, was significantly lower in the
Ablation th CRT arm [18 (29%) vs. 36 (51%); HR 0.40, 95% CI 0.22-
0.73; P = 0.002] (Figure 3B). The causes of death and hospitalization
for HF are listed in the Supplementary material online, Tables S1 and

..
.. S2. In the prespecified subgroup analysis of EF, a benefit in all-cause
.. mortality was observed in patients with EF >35% (HR 0.27, 95% CI
..
.. 0.08-0.84; P = 0.024) with no interaction with patients with EF <_35%
.. (HR 0.34, 95% CI 0.06-1.92; P = 0.22) (Figure 3C and D). We assessed
..
.. the heterogeneity of treatment effects in a post hoc analysis, which
.. included age, sex, body mass index, heart rate, specific symptom
..
.. score, coronary artery disease, and NYHA class as covariates. We
.. found no significant tests for interaction (Figure 4). There was also no

.. 4 years was higher in Ablation th CRT arm compared to both sub..
.. groups of Drug arm, those with baseline heart rate <_102 b.p.m. and

Discussion
In this investigator-initiated, multicentre randomized trial, a strategy
of AV junction ablation and CRT in patients with permanent AF, narrow QRS and at least one hospitalization reduced the risk of death
from any cause during a follow-up of 4 years. The survival curves progressively diverged with the length of observation. At 4 years, the
relative and absolute risk reductions were 74% and 27%, respectively,
and the number needed to treat was 3.7. Moreover, AV junction
Ablation and CRT reduced the combined risks of death from any
cause or hospitalization for HF by 60%. The benefit during the initial
years of observation was mostly attributable to fewer hospitalizations
and that during the late years was g mostly attributable to fewer
deaths. Finally, a benefit in all-cause mortality was observed in
patients with preserved EF with no interaction between patients with
EF >35% and those <_35%. We hypothesize that the observed benefit
was due to the combination of the strict rate control and rate regularization achieved by AV junction ablation together with biventricular pacing, which counteracted the adverse effects of right ventricular
pacing.4,5
APAF-CRT shows an improvement in survival in patients with permanent AF and narrow QRS. Interestingly, while one large, controlled study9 and a meta-analysis of six trials10 showed no reduction
in mortality from any cause in patients after AV junction ablation and
right ventricular pacing, a recent large propensity-score-matched
controlled study,11 in which 37% of patients had received biventricular pacing and 63% right ventricular pacing only showed a statistically
significant reduction (odds ratio = 0.47). Thus, when the confounding
effect of non-physiological right ventricular pacing is overcome by
CRT,4,5 the almost optimal rate regularization achieved with AV junction ablation emerges as the main determinant of improved cardiac
function, reduction in mortality, and hospitalization. This conclusion
is supported by old robust physiology studies.12-14 The strict rate
control with reduction in the ventricular rate from 100 b.p.m. before ablation to 70 b.p.m. after ablation is likely to have contributed

to the observed benefit. Indeed, contrary to RACE II trial,8 which was
unable to show a benefit of strict rate vs. lenient rate control, the
APAF-CRT patients had more severe HF, a perfect rate regularization and less adverse effects of rate-controlling drugs. In the absence
of rate regularization provided by AV junction ablation, CRT alone
was ineffective in the AF substudy of the RAFT trial,15 in a multicentre
observational study16 and in a meta-analysis.17 Furthermore, CRT
was ineffective in patients in sinus rhythm and QRS <120 ms.18
APAF-CRT like patients is a population of highly symptomatic permanent AF patients who had had at least one hospitalization for HF.
The mortality rate observed in the control group was 40% at
4 years. This high mortality rate is similar to that observed in a
Swedish nation-wide long-term case-control study19 in patients hospitalized for AF. This latter study had also similar age, similar gender
distribution, and similar rate of concomitant diseases.
Digoxin was prescribed more often in the control group, but sensitivity analysis showed consistent results with the primary analyses.
Meta-analyses and retrospective analyses showed that digoxin in
patients with AF is associated with an increased mortality.20,21
Neutral effects were, however, also reported.22 A meta-analysis
showed no effect in patients with AF and HF but did in patients without AF and HF.23
Contrary to patients in sinus rhythm, in whom CRT has been
shown to be clinically useful mainly for patients with HF with EF
<_35%, the AF population is heterogeneous with various underlying risk factors and pathophysiological abnormalities, where atrial
cardiomyopathy probably plays a major role.24 In the present
study, most patients had an EF of >35%. A benefit in all-cause
mortality was observed in patients with preserved EF with no
interaction between patients with EF >35% and those with EF
<_35%. This finding suggests a minor prognostic role of the classical parameter of EF and conversely emphasizes the major role of
rate irregularity in causing HF.
The results of the present study cannot be extended to the
patients with AF and wide QRS who have conventional indications
for CRT. However, a survival benefit was observed in wide QRS
patients in a multicentre observational study16 and in a systematic review and meta-analysis.17
The results of the present trial cannot be directly compared with
those of AF ablation trials, owing to different major differences in inclusion criteria and clinical characteristics. For example, CASTLE

trial25 patients were, on average, 8 years younger and no patient was
older than 71 years. The mortality rates in the CASTLE trial were
13.4% in ablation group vs. 25.0% in the drug group (HR 0.53).
Among the AF patients who had clinically diagnosed stable HF at trial
entry (mostly with preserved EF), enrolled in a sub study of
CABANA trial,26 the ablation arm had a 43% relative reduction in allcause mortality (HR 0.57; 95% CI 0.33-0.96) compared to drug therapy alone over a median follow-up of 48.5 months.
Some limitations should be noted. The relatively small population
of the trial could question the generalizability of the results. Most
patients had advancing age and had New York Heart Association
Class >_III. The characteristics of the APAF-CRT patients resemble
that of the general population of highly symptomatic elderly AF
patients who had had at least one hospitalization for HF.19 Thus,

generalizability to less severe HF is limited. Adequacy of rate control
in the Drug arm deserves some comments. The study protocol did
not include procedures for the assessment of medical rate control.
Optimization of pharmacological therapy was left to investigator's decision according to their clinical practice. In theory, a more adequate
strict rate control (e.g. by increasing beta-blocker dosage) could be
protective and equivalent to ablate and pace. Several reasons make
this hypothesis unlikely: (i) there was no interaction of heart rate
measured at baseline and, in the Drug arm, the survival benefit was
similar in patients with baseline heart rate <_102 b.p.m. and those with
baseline heart rate >102 b.p.m (Supplementary material online, Figure
S1); (ii) RACE II trial8 was unable to show a benefit of strict rate vs. lenient rate control; and (iii) in a meta-analysis of randomized trials,27
beta-blockers were unable to show a benefit in survival in patients

with AF, which was irrespective of heart rate, HR = 0.97. COVID-19
pandemic had an impact on the running of the trial. The effect of
COVID-19 on results was assessed in sensitivity analysis, which
showed that the results of the primary endpoint were consistent
with the results of the primary analysis. Five percent of randomized
patients were lost to follow-up and could not be analysed. Finally, future randomized controlled trials comparing biventricular pacing
with conduction system pacing are warranted.
In conclusion, the improvement in survival showed by APAF-CRT
trial supports ablation plus CRT as a first-line therapy in patients with
permanent AF and narrow QRS who were hospitalized for HF, irrespective of their baseline EF.
