A 27-year-old man presented to the emergency room with worsening
shortness of breath for the last 2 weeks with breathlessness at rest and
orthopnoea for the last 2 days. Physical examination revealed bibasilar
crepitations, an elevated jugular venous pulse, and bilateral ankle
oedema. Transthoracic 2D echocardiogram done showed a dilated left
ventricle with global hypokinesia, severe left ventricular dysfunction,
and an ejection fraction of 25%. The left ventricle also demonstrated a
conspicuously thick spongy myocardium with numerous trabeculae
(Supplementary material online, Video S1). Also seen, were deep bloodfilled intra-trabecular crevices, which freely communicate with the left
ventricular cavity, as seen on colour-Doppler, suggestive of left ventricular non-compaction (Supplementary material online, Video S2). Cardiac
magnetic resonance imaging (image) showed a left ventricle with multiple
deep trabeculae (green arrows) and thick spongy myocardium suggestive
of left ventricular non-compaction. Non-compaction represents a unique cardiomyopathy probably caused by arrested non-compaction of
the endomyocardial layer during embryogenesis leading to a thin compact layer and a thick spongy layer in the myocardium. This results in
poor contraction of the ventricle and systolic dysfunction. Furthermore, the blood-filled crevices in the spongy layer can be a source for
embolic phenomena and can be fatal, making it a unique entity to recognize. Our patient was started on diuretics, ace inhibitors, and aspirin
and is currently awaiting a heart transplant.
