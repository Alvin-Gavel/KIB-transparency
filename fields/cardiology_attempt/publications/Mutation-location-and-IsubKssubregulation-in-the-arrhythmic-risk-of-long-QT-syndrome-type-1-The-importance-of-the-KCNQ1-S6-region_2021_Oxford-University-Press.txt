Aims

Mutation type, location, dominant-negative IKs reduction, and possibly loss of cyclic adenosine monophosphate
(cAMP)-dependent IKs stimulation via protein kinase A (PKA) influence the clinical severity of long QT syndrome
type 1 (LQT1). Given the malignancy of KCNQ1-p.A341V, we assessed whether mutations neighbouring p.A341V in
the S6 channel segment could also increase arrhythmic risk.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
Clinical and genetic data were obtained from 1316 LQT1 patients [450 families, 166 unique KCNQ1 mutations, includand results
ing 277 p.A341V-positive subjects, 139 patients with p.A341-neighbouring mutations (91 missense, 48 non-missense),
and 900 other LQT1 subjects]. A first cardiac event represented the primary endpoint. S6 segment missense variant
characteristics, particularly cAMP stimulation responses, were analysed by cellular electrophysiology. p.A341neighbouring mutation carriers had a QTc shorter than p.A341V carriers (477 +/- 33 vs. 490 +/- 44 ms) but longer than
the remaining LQT1 patient population (467 +/- 41 ms) (P < 0.05 for both). Similarly, the frequency of symptomatic subjects in the p.A341-neighbouring subgroup was intermediate between the other two groups (43% vs. 73% vs. 20%;
P < 0.001). These differences in clinical severity can be explained, for p.A341V vs. p.A341-neighbouring mutations, by
the p.A341V-specific impairment of IKs regulation. The differences between the p.A341-neighbouring subgroup and
the rest of LQT1 mutations may be explained by the functional importance of the S6 segment for channel activation.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
KCNQ1 S6 segment mutations surrounding p.A341 increase arrhythmic risk. p.A341V-specific loss of PKA-

dependent IKs enhancement correlates with its phenotypic severity. Cellular studies providing further insights into
IKs-channel regulation and knowledge of structure-function relationships could improve risk stratification. These
findings impact on clinical management.

Long QT syndrome o Genetics o Sudden cardiac death

Introduction
The congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS), with a prevalence of 1
in 2000,1 is the best understood cardiogenetic disorder, often causing
life-threatening arrhythmias.2 Progress made in the last 50 years has
been mind-boggling,3-5 and unravelling of the genetic bases6 has
strengthened the concept that LQTS is an insightful paradigm for sudden cardiac death (SCD). Of the three major genetic subgroups, the
most prevalent is LQTS type 1 (LQT1), caused by loss-of-function
mutations in the KCNQ1 gene,7 encoding the alpha-subunit of the cardiac Kv7.1 potassium channel, conducting the slowly activating
delayed-rectifier Kth current IKs.8 IKs is regulated by the sympathetic
nervous system, which exerts its control on heart rate through b-adrenergic receptor activation. Under normal conditions, b-adrenergic

receptor activation (as part of sympathetic stimulation) modulates
channel function through phosphorylation that enhances IKs and
thereby contributes significantly to action-potential shortening.9 This
physiological response specifically requires cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent activation of protein kinase A (PKA)
to phosphorylate KCNQ1, a mechanism that also involves the A-kinase anchoring protein 9, also known as yotiao, an adaptor protein
that presents PKA to the IKs-channel complex.10 Phosphorylation
also requires the co-assembly of KCNQ1 with KCNE1, its auxiliary
subunit.11 The impairment of IKs prevents proper shortening of the
QT interval during sympathetically driven heart rate increases
and this may trigger lethal arrhythmias during exercise, emotional
stress, and swimming.12 KCNQ1 mutations that cripple basal IKs and
undermine b-adrenergic IKs stimulation facilitate repolarization

KCNQ1 S6 mutations and clinical severity in LQTS

Methods
This study conforms to the Declaration of Helsinki and was performed
according to a protocol approved by the local ethics committees of the
five medical centres involved. Patients gave written informed consent for
DNA diagnostics, electrocardiogram (ECG), and cellular research and
clinical follow-up.

Clinical characteristics of the study
population
Data sources and collection
The study population was composed through a collaborative project
involving five centres from Italy, Norway, France, Russia, and South Africa.
Data were obtained from 1316 LQT1 patients: 277 p.A341V-positive
subjects, in part previously reported16,18 and including 195 individuals
from a large South African LQTS founder population and 82 worldwide
patients with different ethnic backgrounds, 139 patients with p.A341neighbouring mutations, and 900 carriers of KCNQ1 mutations in areas
other than the S6 segment. Jervell-Lange-Nielsen syndrome patients22
were not included. In all subjects, genetic and clinical data were

obtained, including mutation details, demographic information, personal
and family history of disease, type and timing of symptoms, ECG findings
both off and on b-blockers, other treatment, and response to therapy.
The QT interval was measured on the first ECG available, as always
done in the studies from the International Registry for LQTS;14 these
measurements were made on ECGs at rest; we did not use the ECGs
during exercise because the much faster heart rates, combined with the
inherent measurement errors, would have reduced the reliability of our
data. The QT interval was corrected for heart rate (QTc) according to
Bazett's formula,23 valid also for neonates.24 For simplicity, and given
the variable penetrance of individual genetic variants, throughout the
text, we interchangeably use the expressions 'mutation carrier' and
'mutation positive subject'.

Endpoint
The primary endpoint was a first cardiac event occurring from birth
through age 40 years. Cardiac events were defined as syncope (fainting
spells with transient, but complete, loss of consciousness), aborted cardiac arrest (ACA) requiring resuscitation and LQTS-related SCD.
Sudden cardiac deaths in family members judged to be LQTS-related
according to established criteria25 were assumed to have occurred in
genotype-positive subjects and included, even in the absence of genotyping and ECG documentation. Appropriate shocks from an implanted
cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) were considered as major arrhythmic
events. Based on the history of cardiac events, mutation carriers were
classified as symptomatic or asymptomatic. Symptomatic subjects had
experienced at least one cardiac event irrespective of therapy and of age
at onset. Asymptomatic mutation carriers were further distinguished into
(i) 'possibly' asymptomatic, if they were younger than 18 years and had no
events in the absence of b-blockers or if they had no events and initiated
b-blockers before age 18 and (ii) 'truly' asymptomatic, if they were older
than age 18 and without any previous cardiac events off therapy. This categorization, already established,16 allows for a more stringent definition
of asymptomatic status while considering the natural risk exposure by
age and the protective effect of b-blocker therapy. In addition to the occurrence of any first cardiac event, and consistent with our previous
reports, we considered as markers of clinical severity a QTc >500 ms and
the prevalence of major arrhythmic events (ACA/appropriate ICD
shocks/SCD). We determined the efficacy of b-blockers by quantifying
the occurrence of events while on therapy in those mutation carriers
with precise information on treatment and outcome, with at least 1 year
of follow-up after the initiation of therapy and for those who started bblocker therapy before age 41 to avoid the confounding role of possible
comorbidities. With the exception of known long-standing withdrawals,
all the events occurring during sporadic omission of treatment were
considered.

Genetic testing
Genetic testing was conducted with standard genetic protocols through
either next-generation sequencing gene panels or Sanger sequencing. All
clinically relevant genetic variants identified were confirmed with Sanger
sequencing and were classified in accordance with the American College
of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association of Molecular
Pathology (ACMG) guidelines.26 Genetic variation was interrogated
across different population databases, mainly gnomAD, but also the 1000
Genomes project browser, ClinVar, and the Human Gene Mutation
Database, among others.
Subjects carrying multiple mutations were not included. KCNQ1 clinically relevant variants were also categorized according to location, with
topological domains assigned according to the UniProt knowledgebase27
(UniProtKB-P51787, KCNQ1_HUMAN), and type, i.e. being missense

prolongation by the overriding of inward currents, with exaggerated
regional dispersion of repolarization and premature ventricular beats
as culminating factors that precipitate torsades-de-pointes ventricular
tachycardia. These mechanisms link the genetic and biophysical characteristics of KCNQ1 mutations with sympathetically driven tachyarrhythmias in susceptible patients.
It has become evident that mutation type (missense vs. nonmissense, i.e. nonsense, frameshift, in-frame insertions/deletions and
splice-site mutations) and location (transmembrane and pore region,
cytoplasmic loop vs. N- or C-terminus13-15) are differently associated
with clinical severity but, in general, how and why remains poorly
understood. Similarly, dominant-negative mutations appear to be
more severe than those causing haploinsufficiency.14 We have previously identified the hotspot KCNQ1-p.A341V mutation as particularly
malignant, both in a South African LQTS founder population16,17 and
in worldwide patient cohorts from different ethnic backgrounds with
this mutation.18 Recent reports have also highlighted the importance
of loss of PKA-dependent IKs regulation conferred by the KCNQ1 S6
segment pathogenic variant p.A341V19 and several cytoplasmic loop
mutations.15 In these, the significant reduction of basal IKs is further
compromised by the loss of PKA-dependent IKs enhancement, contributing to a severe clinical phenotype.15,19 Conversely, KCNQ1
mutations causing either (i) dominant-negative IKs suppression, but
preserved enhancement,20 or (ii) only mild basal IKs reduction by haploinsufficiency but PKA insensitivity,21 may underlie LQT1 with a
lower probability of arrhythmic events.
On this background, we compared the clinical characteristics of
1316 LQT1 patients, with 166 unique KCNQ1 mutations. We specifically focused on p.A341V and the p.A341-neighbouring mutations in
the S6 segment of the channel protein and correlated clinical severity
with cellular electrophysiology data in the absence or presence of
cAMP to stimulate mutant IKs. We tested the hypothesis that, similarly to p.A341V, p.A341V-neighbouring mutations could also confer a
significant aggravation of the clinical phenotype and, if so, whether
this could be attributed to a concomitant reduction of basal IKs and
loss of PKA-dependent regulation, as per p.A341V.

or non-missense (splice site, in-frame insertions/deletions, nonsense, and
frameshift). We evaluated the arrhythmic risk associated within SEVEN
main genetic subgroups:

o missense p.A341V (S6, residue 341);
o missense p.A341-neighbouring mutations, i.e. mutations in the S6 segment (S6, residues 328-348), other than p.A341V;

o missense mutations in all transmembrane segments other than S6,

including the extracellular loops (S1-S5, residues 122-168, 197-248,
and 262-327);
missense cytoplasmic loop (C-loop) mutations (S2-S3 C-loop, residues 169-196 and S4-S5 C-loop, residues 249-261);
missense N-terminus mutations (residues 1-122);
missense C-terminus mutations (residues 349-676); and
non-missense mutations.

Among the non-missense variants, there were two well-established splicing variants (p.A344A and c.1032th1 G>A) and an in-frame deletion variant
(p.339delF) that all affect a portion of the nucleotide sequence of the channel that codes for the KCNQ1 S6 segment. For the sake of clarity, they were
also evaluated separately (see Results). Therefore, their association with
markers of clinical severity was specifically considered and evaluated in
comparison with both the missense p.A341-neighbouring mutations and
the other non-missense mutations mapping outside segment S6.

Imaging of membrane expression
Wild-type (WT) and mutant KCNQ1 were tagged with green fluorescent
protein (GFP) at the KCNQ1 C-terminus. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)
cells were grown on 8-well chamber slides and transfected using
LipofectamineTM LTX and PLUSTM reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For
transfection, 80 ng of WT KCNQ1-GFP or mutant KCNQ1-GFP cDNA and
160 ng of untagged KCNE1 cDNA were used. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cellular localization of KCNQ1 was determined by spinning-disc microscopy (see Supplementary material online, Methods Section).

Electrophysiological experiments
p.A341V and p.A341-neighbouring mutations p.S338C, p.F339S, p.L342F,
p.P343R, p.A344V, and p.G345R were tested. For patch-clamp recordings in WT or homozygous mutant experiments, KCNQ1 (0.25 mg; WT or
mutant) and KCNE1 (0.5 mg) cDNA were co-transfected in CHO cells
using FuGENEV 6 (Promega Corporation). In studies examining heterozygous conditions, 0.125 lg WT KCNQ1 and 0.125 lg mutant KCNQ1 were
transfected with 0.5 lg KCNE1. In addition, yotiao (1 mg) was cotransfected in cells employed for patch-clamp recordings. At 20-24 h
after transfection, CHO cells were harvested from the culture dish by a
brief trypsinization, washed twice with culture medium, and placed in a
perfusion chamber on an inverted microscope that was continuously perfused with an external Tyrode's solution containing the following (in
mmol/L): 132 NaCl, 4.8 KCl, 1.2 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, and 5 glucose
(pH = 7.4 with NaOH). Pipettes were filled with solution containing the
following (in mmol/L): 110 K-aspartate, 5 ATP-K2, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 11
EGTA, and 10 HEPES (pH = 7.3 with KOH). To mimic PKA-mediated badrenergic receptor stimulation, 200 mmol/L cAMP and 0.2 lmol/L okadaic acid were added to the pipette solution when appropriate.
Experiments were performed using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique at room temperature on the basis of group comparisons (absence
or presence of cAMP) for WT, and heterozygous p.A341V and named
p.A341-neighbouring variants. All measurements were completed within
5 min of establishing the whole-cell patch to minimize the influence of IKs
rundown.19 Pipette resistance ranged between 1.5 and 3 MX, access resistance was determined to be up to 8 MX, and the series resistance was
electronically compensated at 60-80%. Currents were sampled at 2 kHz
after low-pass filtering at 1 kHz. Current density was calculated by dividing current amplitude by cell capacity. Cells were kept at a holding potential of -80 mV. The I/V protocol consisted of 5-ms depolarizing pulses
from -50 to th60 mV in 10-mV steps. Tail currents were recorded on
repolarization to -40 mV. Voltage dependence of activation (evaluated
from normalized IKs-tail amplitudes) was fitted with a Boltzmann equation: I/Imax = 1/f1thexp[(V - V1/2)/k]g to determine the membrane potential for half-maximal activation (V1/2) and the slope factor (k).

Statistical analysis
Continuous data were reported as mean and standard deviation or as median and interquartile range (IQR 25th-75th percentile), as appropriate,
and analysed by one-way ANOVA or by Kruskal-Wallis test. Categorical
variables were presented as absolute and relative frequencies and compared among groups by v2 or Fisher's exact test. No Bonferroni adjustments for multiple tests were applied. Event-free survival was described by
Kaplan-Meier cumulative estimates, with comparisons performed by the
log-rank test. Time from birth to any first cardiac event (syncope, ACA,
SCD, whichever occurred first) through age 40 years was considered. To
estimate the independent risk of genetic factors of interest for a first cardiac event, a Cox regression analysis was used, stratified by sex to relax
the assumption of proportional hazards, and adjusted for QTc duration.
As correlation among data points can underestimate the standard error
used in significance testing, adjustment was made by using the robust sandwich variance estimator for family relatedness. Hazard ratios (HRs) were
presented along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
Calculations were performed using the statistical software SPSS
Statistics, version 23 (IBM Co, Armonk, NY, USA) and R, version 3.6.28
For statistical comparisons at the cellular level, unpaired two-sided
Student's t-test or one-way ANOVA were used as appropriate. P-value
<0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results
All KCNQ1 mutations identified in the study population are listed in
the Supplementary material online, Appendix Table S1, with their respective numbers of carriers and classification. Figure 1 shows their
topology along the KCNQ1 channel protein. Of a total of 166 distinct
nucleotide sequence variants, most (n = 148, 89%) were classified
according to ACMG as pathogenic (n = 79) or likely pathogenic
(n = 69), with a minority (n = 18, 11%) as variants of uncertain significance. Furthermore, 113 (68%) are expected to result in missense
and 53 (32%) in non-missense amino acid changes. Missense mutations were further subdivided according to location: N-terminus

.. loops (n = 20; 18%), S6 segment (p.A341V and p.A341-neighbouring

subsets (Table 2). Likewise, when only major arrhythmic events were
considered, this frequency in the p.A341-neighbouring mutations carriers (7.7%) was significantly lower than that in the p.A341V subset
(28%), but almost two-fold higher than in the other LQT1 patients
(4.6%). As expected for all LQT1 symptomatic patients,12 most (91%)
of the arrhythmic events among the p.A341-neighbouring mutations
carriers occurred during exercise (66%, of which 38% while swimming) or were associated with emotional arousal (25%). Only a few
cardiac events occurred at rest or in association with other conditions
(9%). Kaplan-Meier curves describing the cumulative survival to any
first cardiac event for the p.A341-neighbouring mutations, in comparison with p.A341V and all other pooled LQT1 mutation carriers, are
shown in Figure 3. A significant difference in survival was observed
(P < 0.001), with the p.A341-neighbouring mutations group confirming
its intermediate position among the other two subgroups. The 40-year
cumulative event-free survival of p.A341-neighbouring mutation carriers was 49% (95% CI 38-63) compared to 22% (95% CI 17-28) and
76% (95% CI 72-80), respectively. Indeed, they had a significantly
(P < 0.001) more favourable prognosis compared to the p.A341V
population but remained at a significantly (P < 0.001) higher risk compared to the rest of LQT1 patients. Consistently, at a multivariable
Cox model, both S6-segment mutation groups were at a significantly
higher risk of a first arrhythmic event compared to all the other missense LQT1 variants (p.A341 neighbouring: HR 2.3, 95% CI 1.6-3.2;
P < 0.001; A341V: HR 5.3, 95% CI 3.9-7.2; P < 0.001). A secondary univariate survival analysis performed only on probands to correct for the
potential effect of familial clustering on phenotype confirmed the
results (Figure 4).
Non-missense mutations mapping to S6
In 48 patients from 20 families, there were three non-missense mutations (the p.339delF in-frame deletion, and the well-known p.A344A
and c.1032th1 G>A splicing variants) that affect the nucleotide

sequence of the channel at a region that codes for part of the KCNQ1
S6 segment (Table 1). Although in general non-missense mutations are
largely expected to produce aberrant transcripts that will undergo
early degradation and will not reach the cell membrane to confer
dominant-negative effects on WT channels,14 available functional studies for p.339delF29 and p.A344A30 have previously shown that these
actually act through dominant-negative mechanisms and for this reason
they were also analysed separately (Table 2 and Figure 4). As within this
group the hot spot A344A pathogenetic splicing variant predominates
with 40 of 48 cases (83%), we looked at it in isolation. We found that 23
(57.5%) patients with this common mutation are symptomatic, an observation in agreement with what reported by a Japanese study.31
Interestingly, altogether the three non-missense mutations behaved

similarly to the 10 missense (p.A341-neighbouring) mutations for both
QTc (478 +/- 31 vs. 477 +/- 33 ms) and cardiac event rates, with a 40-year
cumulative event-free survival of 32% (95% CI 19-55) vs. 49% (95% CI
38-63) (log-rank P = 0.054). By contrast, compared to carriers of all
other non-missense variants located anywhere else, they carried a much
higher risk of arrhythmic events, with a 40-year cumulative survival of
32% (95% CI 19-55) vs. 83% (95% CI 78-88) (P < 0.001; Figure 5).

Mutations outside the S6 segment
Clinical outcome of S6 mutations vs. all other KCNQ1
mutations
Tables 2 and 3 summarize the clinical characteristics of the 900 carriers of all other (non-S6 segment) mutations. Missense mutations
involving membrane-spanning segments, including the pore region of
KCNQ1, carried the highest risk for arrhythmic events (31%), compared to N- and C-termini and non-missense mutations (5%, 13%,
and 13%, respectively). Interestingly, among the 20 different mutations identified in the C-loops S2-S3 and S4-S5, the 38 carriers of
three variants, i.e. p.G189R, p.R190Q, and p.V254M, which were previously associated with a defective PKA-dependent IKs stimulation,15
showed a significantly longer QTc (491 +/- 46 ms) compared to that of

..
.. the remaining 17 C-loop mutation carriers (470 +/- 43 ms), and also of
.. all other KCNQ1 genetic subgroups (Table 3; P < 0.01 for all compari..
.. sons). However, the difference in the proportion of symptomatic

other missense mutations elsewhere located along KCNQ1
(Supplementary material online, Appendix Table S3). Of the 80 missense p.A341 neighbouring mutation carriers analysed, 50 (62.5%)
were on b-blocker therapy and, during a follow-up time of 11 years
(IQR 4-24), 7 (14%) patients had at least one cardiac event, which in
four cases was lethal (SCD n = 3) or near-lethal (ACA n = 1). The incidence of breakthrough events despite b-blockers among these
p.A341-neighbouring mutations carriers was significantly lower compared to that among p.A341V carriers (14% vs. 52%, P < 0.001) and
higher compared to the remaining LQT1 patients (14% vs. 5%,
P = 0.03). Syncope on b-blockers, but not ACA, SCD, and ICD
shocks, was more frequent among carriers of non-missense than missense p.A341 neighbouring mutations (30% vs. 14%).

Cellular studies
In line with previous work by us19 and others,15 we investigated the
cellular underpinning of our clinical findings by assessing the PKA-dependent regulation of mutant IKs for the KCNQ1 S6 region of which
carriers exhibited the most severe clinical phenotype, p.A341V vs.
p.A341-neighbouring mutations. First, we determined the effect of
mutations on homozygous KCNQ1-membrane expression by confocal microscopy in CHO cells co-transfected with GFP-tagged
KCNQ1 mutant or WT and KCNE1 subunits. Our results show

(Supplementary material online, Appendix Figure S1) that p.A341V19
and p.A341-neighbouring mutations p.S338C, p.A344V, and p.G345R
had a clear fluorescent membrane expression, but not p.F339S,
p.L342F, and p.P343R. These results were grossly corroborated by
Western blot experiments in which the cytoplasmic (whole-lysate)
and membrane-fraction expressions of these KCNQ1 mutations were
compared with WT channels (Supplementary material online,
Appendix Figure S1B and C). Homozygous expression led to a measurable (although significantly reduced) IKs for p.A341V and all p.A341neighbouring mutations (Supplementary material online, Appendix
Figure S1D).
Mutant IKs was subsequently characterized in the absence or presence of cAMP stimulation (Figure 7). To this end, we mimicked the
heterozygous status of carriers by co-transfecting WT KCNQ1,
mutant KCNQ1 and KCNE1 subunits in a 1:1:3 molar ratio. Significant
suppression of unstimulated IKs was found for p.A341V and p.A341neighbouring mutations p.L342F, p.P343R, and p.G345R, at a variable
degree. Kinetic differences are indicated in Supplementary material
online, Appendix Table S3. To mimic b-adrenergic receptor stimulation in WT and mutant IKs, cAMP/okadaic acid was added to the pipette solution in a group comparison vs. unstimulated current. Unlike
what was reported for p.A341V,19 IKs tails increased significantly
upon cAMP/okadaic acid for all p.A341-neighbouring mutations
(Figure 7B and D), with a leftward shift of their activation curves in
most cases, indicating significant responsiveness to the b-adrenergic

material online, Appendix Table S3). Thus, among the p.A341-neighbouring mutations mapping to the S6 segment, impairment of cAMPdependent IKs stimulation was demonstrated only for p.A341V, the
most malignant mutation.

Discussion
The unprecedented size of our LQT1 population (>1300 patients)
provides a solid basis for our findings. We demonstrate that KCNQ1
p.A341-neighbouring mutations in the S6 segment of the channel are

associated with a more deleterious arrhythmia phenotype and a
poorer cumulative survival than mutations from any other region.
While the p.A341V mutation stands out in severity, as we have
reported,16-18 largely due to its loss of PKA-dependent IKs regulation,
all other p.A341-neighbouring mutations tested show an almost normal IKs enhancement. Nonetheless, they do correlate with a more severe phenotype compared to all other LQT1 mutations (although
not due to PKA insensitivity), thus providing definitive evidence for
the importance of mutation location in determining the specific genotype-phenotype correlation. This further refines risk stratification for
LQTS patients, representing another step towards precision
medicine.5,32

The present vs. previous studies
Studies aiming to correlate genotype and phenotype were already
attempted soon after the identification of the main LQTS genes in
1995-96. In 1997, Donger et al.33 were the first to introduce the
notion of 'forme fruste' LQTS due to a C-terminal KCNQ1 mutation, which was associated with a much milder phenotype (i.e. less
prolonged QTc, less symptoms, and less SCD events) in carrier
patients with respect to patients carrying mutations in the pore
and S6 segment, as well as the S4-S5 C-loop. The seed for the
concepts of 'mutation topology' or 'location' was thus planted.
The game-changer came 10 years later when Moss et al.14 subgrouped the 77 unique KCNQ1 mutations identified in 600 LQT1
patients based on location (transmembrane vs. N/C terminal),
coding type (missense vs. non-missense), and biophysical effect
(dominant-negative vs. haploinsufficient). They demonstrated that
patients with transmembrane, missense, or dominant-negative
mutations were at significantly increased risk compared to
patients carrying C-terminal, non-missense, or haploinsufficient

mutations, independently of traditional clinical risk factors and bblocker therapy.14
These results made sense from a biological standpoint. The mechanistic basis by which KCNQ1 mutations confer their effects and result in IKs reduction was initially broadly categorized under the
umbrella terms 'haploinsufficiency' and 'dominant-negative suppression'.14 Since the functional IKs channel is a tetrameric protein, these
two mechanisms could explain the potential contribution, or not, of
mutant subunits to the tetrameric channel complex, as well as the respective functional consequences. Haploinsufficient KCNQ1 mutations are those that do not interfere with the function of the WT
channel product, nor do their products form heterotetrameric channels and generally result in 50% of WT channels being available at the
plasma membrane and conducting IKs currents. This is a more favourable scenario than dominant-negative mutations, which may exert
their effects by either co-assembling and retaining WT subunits intracellularly, thus reducing dramatically IKs, or form heterotetrameric
channels at the cell membrane with much altered biophysical

properties.14,29,30,34 This implies that dominant-negative mutations
may introduce changes to the channel complex that are structurally
less disruptive, thus permitting their co-assembly with WT subunits,
while as the number of subunits in a complex increases to form the
functional complex, so does the potential of a dominant-negative effect.35 In either case, the overall effect is a >50% IKs reduction and,
depending on each particular mutation, this reduction may range
from mild (>50%) to significant (<_93.75%).14,34,35

While missense mutations may have diverse and unpredictable
functional consequences, non-missense mutations are considered
more likely to cause haploinsufficiency, since they result in aberrant
transcripts that may easily be subjected to early intracellular degradation due to nonsense mediated mRNA decay.14,34 However, there
are notable exceptions, such as a number of KCNQ1 non-missense
mutations resulting in mutant subunits that are nevertheless able to
form heterotetramers with their WT counterparts and cause

dominant-negative suppression of WT channels. This has been demonstrated by in vitro functional studies for diverse KCNQ1 nonmissense mutations, such as in-frame deletions29 and splicing30 and
frameshift36 mutations, two of which form part of the non-missense
mutations mapping to the S6 segment in this study. In addition, several missense mutations have been shown to act through more than
one mechanism.37,38 This highlights the complexities of accurately
portraying, and even more predicting, the biophysical effects of each
mutation in the complex cellular environment.
The KCNQ1-p.A341V pathogenic variant was first functionally
characterized in Xenopus oocytes in the late 1990s by Sanguinetti's
group.39 They showed that co-expression of A341V and WT KCNQ1
caused only a small, but statistically significant, rightward shift in the
voltage dependence of IKs activation and they concluded that the mutation conferred 'little or no dominant-negative effect'.39,40 Another
study concluded that p.A341V is a simple loss-of-function mutation
without dominant-negative effects.41 These in vitro results, surprisingly, did not correlate with the severity of the clinical phenotypes of the
respective p.A341V-positive patients, but this was attributed to other
unknown factors.39 When we identified the KCNQ1-p.A341V founder mutation in a South African population where we observed a
particularly malignant clinical expression of LQTS, we were also
puzzled by this lack of genotype-phenotype correlation.16
Consequently, we decided to reassess functionally the p.A341V variant in CHO cells, thus eliminating many of the confounding factors of
previously used assays,16 although we cannot completely exclude
that some cells selected for electrophysiological experiments did not
express one or more of the transfected plasmids.
We found that p.A341V exerts a dominant-negative effect on IKs,
albeit milder than that of a typical dominant-negative mutation, which
was more in line with the clinical phenotype.16-18 Still, the high arrhythmic potential of KCNQ1-p.A341V could not be solely explained
by being missense, transmembrane, and with a mild dominantnegative effect, especially when compared to other KCNQ1 mutations with similar features.18 In experiments similar to the present
ones, we mimicked the conditions of PKA-mediated b-adrenergic receptor stimulation and showed that p.A341V, beyond affecting basal
IKs, markedly cripples IKs under conditions of b-adrenergic stimulation,19 an experimental observation that was for the first time much
more in accordance with the ECG changes and the clinical features
observed in p.A341V-positive patients. The observation that this
pathogenic variant exerts its effects in a manner much more complex
than what could be explained by simply dichotomizing it as missense
or non-missense, transmembrane or N/C terminal, haploinsufficient,
or dominant-negative, led us to focus our attention on the region of
the S6 transmembrane channel segment where the p.A341V resides.
At variance with previous studies that have lumped together all
transmembrane mutations, we used p.A341V as a flag, to map a region possibly worth being explored and analysed separately, i.e. the
S6-transmembrane segment. By doing so, we have identified the
p.A341-neighbouring mutations as conferring a more severe arrhythmic phenotype compared to all other LQT1 mutations, albeit lower
than that conferred by p.A341V itself. Barsheshet et al.15 previously
reported a higher risk of life-threatening arrhythmic events among
carriers of C-loop mutations compared to other predefined KCNQ1
genetic subgroups. Our findings vary with those of that study.15
There are several factors that may account for this difference. First,

KCNQ1 S6 mutations and clinical severity in LQTS

Clinical and conceptual implications
Our data stress the importance of mutation location within the S6
transmembrane segment of the KCNQ1 channel protein. From a clinical point of view, this type of information should not be ignored and
should usefully complement a progressively more accurate risk stratification together with the implications of the presence/absence of
'modifier genes'.6,49-53 LQT1 carriers of a mutation located in the S6
segment should be now regarded as at higher risk and be treated
more aggressively (at the very least with full-dose b-blockade and frequent 12-lead Holter recordings to monitor repolarization changes).
From a conceptual point of view, the present study highlights the
growing importance of coupling carefully collected phenotypic information with comprehensive genetic analyses, advanced cellular electrophysiology, and eventually also insight from structure-function
relationships of normal channel function, as a critical way forward for
the implementation of precision medicine in channelopathies.5,32 In
addition, physiologically more relevant in vitro systems, such as
patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes, could be useful for validating previous findings as well as for
providing insight into the expression levels of transcripts resulting
from missense vs. non-missense mutations.32,54 Similarly, the recent
availability of refined three-dimensional structural models of
the human KCNQ1 channel protein may advance the understanding
of how mutations impair normal channel structure-function
relationships.42,46
Clinical cardiologists should become aware that a proper clinical
management of their LQTS patients can no longer ignore, as a minimum, a reasonable level of understanding of the implications of the
main characteristics of the disease-causing mutations, including their
type and location.

The S6 segment also plays a role in channel modulation through
its direct interaction or proximal contact with the channel's accessory subunits.47,48 Mutations p.S338C and p.F340C have been in
fact shown to alter KCNQ1 modulation by KCNE1 and KCNE3, respectively,47 while KCNE1 has been shown to naturally interact
with the KCNQ1 pore region through residues F339 and F340.48
More recently, transmembrane interactions of KCNE3 and KCNQ1
were specifically mapped within a cleft, partially formed by the
contribution of the S6 segment from one subunit.46 Here, under
what we have defined as p.A341-neighbouring mutations, 8 of the
10 unique missense mutations in 68 out of 86 carrier patients actually affect the specific residues of the above-mentioned motifs
(Supplementary material online, Table S1), thus supporting the importance of this segment for normal channel function, and further
justify the focus of our study.
