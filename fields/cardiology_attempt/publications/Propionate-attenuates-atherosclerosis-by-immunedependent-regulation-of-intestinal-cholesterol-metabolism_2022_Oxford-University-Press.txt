Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ACVD) is a major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide, and
increased low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) play a critical role in development and progression of atherosclerosis.
Here, we examined for the first time gut immunomodulatory effects of the microbiota-derived metabolite propionic acid (PA) on intestinal cholesterol metabolism.

(IL)-10 levels in the intestinal microenvironment, which in turn suppressed the expression of Niemann-Pick C1-like 1
(Npc1l1), a major intestinal cholesterol transporter. Blockade of IL-10 receptor signalling attenuated the PA-related
reduction in total and LDL cholesterol and augmented atherosclerotic lesion severity in the HFD-fed Apoe-/- mice.
To translate these preclinical findings to humans, we conducted a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled
human study (clinical trial no. NCT03590496). Oral supplementation with 500 mg of PA twice daily over the course
of 8 weeks significantly reduced LDL [-15.9 mg/dL (-8.1%) vs. -1.6 mg/dL (-0.5%), P = 0.016], total [-19.6 mg/dL
(-7.3%) vs. -5.3 mg/dL (-1.7%), P = 0.014] and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels [PA vs. placebo:

Graphical Abstract

The figure illustrates the proposed model of the cholesterol-lowering and atheroprotective properties of propionate. A high-fat high-cholesterol diet
causes a disbalance of immune cells in the small intestinal microenvironment, with reduced regulatory T cell frequencies and interleukin-10 concentrations.
Altered regulatory T cell levels are rescued upon exogenous propionate supplementation, with increased local levels. This in turn modulates NPC1L1 expression and membrane density, with a subsequent reduction in cholesterol absorption, ultimately leading to reduced atherogenesis. The illustration was

Translational perspective
Our study identifies a novel regulatory circuit that links the gut microbiota metabolite propionic acid (PA), a short-chain fatty acid, with
the gut immune system to control intestinal cholesterol homeostasis and prevent the development of atherosclerosis. This mechanism
involves PA-mediated increase in regulatory T-cell numbers and interleukin-10 levels in the intestinal microenvironment, which in turn
suppresses the expression of Niemann-Pick C1-like 1, a major intestinal cholesterol transporter. In a proof-of-concept clinical study,
we demonstrate that oral supplementation of PA over the course of 8 weeks significantly reduced low-density lipoprotein and nonhigh-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in subjects with hypercholesterolaemia.
Our findings suggest that supplementation of PA may improve cholesterol homeostasis and contribute to cardiovascular health.
Another translational outlook is the modulation of the gut microbiome, e.g. by dietary approaches or by prebiotics to sustainably increase the intestinal abundance of PA producing bacteria as a novel intrinsic concept of atheroprotection.

with a depleted gut microbiota that were fed either a standard chow
(SCD) or high-fat diet (HFD) for 6 weeks. In mice with a depleted gut
microbiota, we found increased levels of total, very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), and LDL cholesterol compared to those of
conventionally raised Apoe-/- mice under an SCD and an HFD (Figure
1A-F). These findings support a functional role of gut microbiotadependent metabolic pathways in the control of blood cholesterol
levels. The increase in cholesterol levels was accompanied by
increased atherosclerotic lesion size after 6 weeks of either diet
(Figure 1G and H). Next, we examined the effect of exogenous PA
administered via daily oral gavage on plasma lipids in hypercholesterolaemic Apoe-/- mice (Figure 2A). We observed that treatment with
PA (200 mg/kg) prevented HFD-induced increases in total, VLDL,
and LDL cholesterol (Figure 2B and F).
Importantly, the vehicle used for oral gavage (0.9% sodium chloride) did not have any relevant effects on blood lipids metabolism
(Supplementary material online, Figure S1). Moreover, HFD increased
several cholesteryl esters, some of which were reduced upon
treatment with PA (Supplementary material online, Figure S2).
Consequently, the HFD-induced increase in atherosclerotic lesion
size was attenuated by PA (Figure 2G and H).
Notably, PA treatment significantly lowered total, LDL and VLDL
cholesterol in antibiotic treated and HFD-fed Apoe-/- mice
(Supplementary material online, Figure S3A-E) demonstrating that PA
can compensate for the de-regulated intestinal cholesterol metabolism in gut microbiota-depleted mice. Treatment with PA also tended
to attenuate atherosclerotic lesion size in antibiotic treated and
HFD-fed Apoe-/- mice, although this effect did not reach statistical significance (Supplementary material online, Figure S3F and G) suggesting
that gut microbial-dependent anti-atherogenic mechanisms go beyond intestinal cholesterol regulation.

Propionate impacts intestinal
cholesterol metabolism by modulating
the expression of Niemann-Pick C1-like
protein 1
To further understand the mechanisms underlying PA-mediated lipid
regulation, we determined the expression of major genes involved in
hepatic cholesterol metabolism. We found up-regulated expression
of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (Srebp2) and cholesterol
7 alpha-hydroxylase (Cyp7a1) in hypercholesterolaemic Apoe-/- mice,
of which only the up-regulated expression of Srebp2 was reversed
upon PA treatment (Figure 3A and B). Other genes involved in hepatic
cholesterol and bile acid synthesis, including LDL receptor (Ldlr)
(Figure 3C), proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (Pcsk9), 3hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase
(Hmgcr), and farnesoid X receptor (Fxr), were not significantly altered
by HFD or additional PA treatment (Supplementary material online,
Figure S4A-C). Next, we sought to investigate whether PA impacts
the activity of HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-controlling enzyme of
cholesterol synthesis. However, the enzymatic activity of HMG-CoA
reductase was not affected by PA at increasing concentrations
(Supplementary material online, Figure S4D). These findings argue
against a relevant role of PA in hepatic regulation of cholesterol metabolism. Beside Hepatic cholesterol clearance and synthesis, intestinal cholesterol metabolism, particularly cholesterol trafficking and

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (ACVDs) are a major global
health care burden and a leading cause of mortality and morbidity
worldwide.1 Elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and
non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL) cholesterol are important
modifiable risk factors for ACVD, thus representing a major effective
target for ACVD prevention.2,3 In recent years, increasing attention
has been devoted to identifying gut microbial pathways affecting
metabolic pathways4 or atherogenesis.5-7 In particular, gut
microbiota-derived metabolites that are transported to the peripheral circulation in the host via the portal vein can act as signalling molecules and may impact atherogenesis by regulating host metabolism,8
immune homeostasis,9 and vascular function.10,11
Among detrimental metabolites, trimethylamine N-oxide, generated by gut microbial metabolism of trimethylamine-containing
nutrients such as choline and carnitine, has been shown to promote
the development of atherosclerosis in animal models5,6,12 with prognostic implications for patients with coronary heart disease,13 chronic
kidney disease,14 ischaemic stroke,15 and mortality.16 Short-chain
fatty acids (SCFAs; i.e. acetic, propionic, and butyric acids) derived by
gut microbial fermentation of dietary fibres, on the other hand, have
shown beneficial effects on host metabolism and cardiac health.17,18
Although SCFAs are primarily considered important energy sources
in intestinal epithelial cells, they also possess regulatory properties
and affect host metabolism, immune homeostasis, and cell proliferation.17 Propionic acid (PA) has been shown to critically regulate Tcell-mediated immunity and thereby modulate the disease course in
autoimmune diseases, particularly by promoting the differentiation
and functional capacity of CD25th Foxp3th regulatory T cells
(Tregs).19-21 PA also has been reported to promote beneficial effects
on cardiac remodelling in experimental hypertension by counteracting hypertension-induced imbalance between Tregs and effector T
cells.22 Epidemiological studies suggest that sufficient fibre intake may
contribute to preventing dyslipidaemia and atherosclerotic vascular
disease.23 However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.
Tregs have been reported to have the ability to modulate cholesterol
metabolism and subsequent atheroprotective effects,24 which raises
the question of whether SCFAs may regulate lipids in an immunedependent way.
Here, we examine for the first time pathways whereby the
microbiome-derived SCFA PA may regulate lipoprotein levels that
are causal for atherosclerotic lesion development in hypercholesterolaemic and atherosclerosis-prone apolipoprotein E (Apoe)-/- mice.
Moreover, in a proof-of-concept double-blind and placebocontrolled clinical study, the effect of PA on LDL and total cholesterol levels was evaluated in humans with hypercholesterolaemia.

absorption, are key components of cholesterol homeostasis.25 We
therefore investigated a potential regulatory role of PA on intestinal
expression of Niemann-Pick C1-like protein 1 (Npc1l1), a major
transmembrane transporter responsible for intestinal cholesterol absorption.26 We also examined the impact of PA on the expression of
apical sodium-bile acid transporter (Asbt), which mediates active uptake of conjugated bile acids27 to maintain their enterohepatic recirculation. While PA normalized the HFD-induced increase in Npc1l1
gene expression in the small intestine, it did not affect HFD-induced
Asbt expression (Figure 3D and E). Increased density of NPC1L1 was
also observed in histological sections of the small intestine from
Apoe-/- mice fed with HFD compared to mice fed with SCD and was
prevented in HFD-fed mice under PA treatment (Figure 3F and G).
Interestingly, we found no significant differences in the expression of
genes regulating the flux of lipids across small intestinal enterocytes,
including ATP-binding cassette subfamily G member 5 (Abcg5),
acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase (Acat2), and ATP-binding cassette
transporter 1 (Abca1), between PA-treated and -untreated mice
(Supplementary material online, Figure S5A-C). Next, we investigated the functional relevance of altered Npc1l1 expression and analysed plasma levels of the phytosterols stigmasterol and sitosterol in
Apoe-/- mice that were fed with SCD or HFD with or without PA.
Since the abundance of plasma phytosterol depends on dietary intake

of intestinal T cells in the control of systemic metabolism,31 we
hypothesized that modulation of the intestinal adaptive immune system at least partly mediates PA-related alterations in cholesterol metabolism. In line with previous reports20,30 we observed an increase
of CD25th Foxp3th Tregs in the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs)
and the peripheral circulation (Figure 4A-C) of HFD-fed Apoe-/- mice
in response to PA. Notably, the splenic Treg population was not
altered, suggesting that the small intestine was the primary source of
the increase in Tregs in response to PA in our model (Figure 4D).
Notably, we did not observe alterations in T helper 1 (Th1) or Th17
cell frequencies in the MLNs, peripheral circulation or spleen upon
PA treatment (Supplementary material online, Figure S8A-F). The increase in the Treg cell population in response to PA was accompanied by increased concentrations of interleukin (IL)-10, the major
Treg cytokine, in the small intestinal wall (Figure 4E). Other cytokines
related to Th1 or Th17 cells or monocytes, including tumour necrosis factor-alpha, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, IL-6, and interferon gamma, were not altered by PA (Figure 4F-I).

resulted in elevated phytosterol plasma levels (Figure 5L and M),
which is indicative of enhanced intestinal sterol absorption.
These findings support a regulatory circuit in which PA-induced
elevations of Treg cell frequency and local IL-10 concentrations in
the small intestine regulate the expression of the major sterol transporter NPC1L1. Thereby, PA indirectly regulates the absorption of
cholesterol, with subsequent implications for the development of
hyperlipidaemia-induced atherosclerosis in Apoe-/- mice.

Propionic acid reduces serum lowdensity lipoprotein and total cholesterol
in hypercholesterolaemic humans
To explore the clinical relevance of our findings, we performed a
randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled study in hypercholesterolaemic subjects evaluating the effect of oral supplementation
of PA on LDL cholesterol blood levels as a primary endpoint and
total, non-HDL and HDL cholesterol levels among the secondary
endpoints (trial profile shown in Supplementary material online,
Figure S9). A total of 62 individuals with baseline LDL cholesterol levels >115 mg/dL were enrolled and underwent 1:1 randomization to
receive either oral placebo (500 mg) twice daily or PA (500 mg) twice
daily for 8 weeks. The baseline clinical characteristics and biochemical
parameters did not differ between the two study groups (Table 1).

Study participants were advised to maintain their regular physical activity and dietary habits during the study period (dietary information
shown in Supplementary material online, Table S1).
After 8 weeks, PA lowered LDL cholesterol levels [PA vs. placebo:
-15.9 mg/dL (-8.1%) vs. -1.6 mg/dL (-0.5%), P = 0.016] and total cholesterol levels [PA vs. placebo -19.6 mg/dL (-7.3%) vs. -5.3 mg/dL
(-1.7%), P = 0.014] compared to placebo (Figure 6A-D). Moreover,
PA lowered non-HDL cholesterol levels [PA vs. placebo: -18.9 mg/dL
(-9.1%) vs. -0.6 mg/dL (-0.5%), P = 0.002], whereas no significant difference in the change in HDL cholesterol levels [PA vs. placebo:
-0.7 mg/dL (-0.9%) vs. -4.7 mg/dL (-6.0%), P = 0.078] was observed
between the groups (Figure 6E-H). Notably, since the majority of
study participant is represented by women (Table 1), in a subanalysis
we evaluated the change in LDL and total cholesterol levels in male
study participants and found a significant reduction in LDL

(Supplementary material online, Figure S10A) but did not affect gut
microbiota composition and diversity in a subset of participants for
whom faecal samples were available at baseline and at the end of the
study (Supplementary material online, Figure S10B and C). In line with
the finding from the experimental studies, phenotyping of peripheral
T cells displayed significant increase of Tregs in the PA group
(Supplementary material online, Figure S11A and B) without significant
alteration of Th17 or Th1 cell numbers (Supplementary material online, Figure S12A and B).
Moreover, we evaluated the effect of PA on plasma levels of two
distinct factors, fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4) and glucagon,
involved in the regulation of glucose metabolism, which were not significantly altered upon oral supplementation with PA (Supplementary
material online, Figure S13).

regulatory property of propionate to decrease intestinal cholesterol
absorbance via an immunomodulatory pathway. This pathway
involves a novel circuit in which increased IL-10 in the intestinal
microenvironment down-regulates NPC1l1, the major intestinal
cholesterol transporter. Moreover, the clinical relevance of the experimental observations is highlighted for the first time in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial evaluating the
cholesterol-lowering effect of propionate demonstrating the translational potential of our findings.
Bartolomaeus et al.22 showed vasoprotective effects of PA in a
mouse model of angiotensin II-induced hypertensive cardiovascular
damage, e.g. by preventing angiotensin II-induced local cardiac proinflammatory immune cell infiltration. Other vasoprotective properties
of propionate include blood pressure-lowering effects in mice via
endothelial G protein-coupled receptor by dilating resistance vessels
in an endothelium-dependent manner.10 While in these studies lipidindependent models of vascular pathologies were used, our study
focused on lipid-modulating properties of PA with subsequent protective effects on atherosclerosis development.
Gut microbial-generated metabolites are important modulators of
the host physiologic functions and metabolism.34 Short-chain fatty

Moreover, epidemiological studies have suggested that long-term
fibre intake may contribute to preventing dyslipidaemia and atherosclerotic vascular disease,23 although the underlying mechanisms are
only poorly understood.
The current study demonstrates a marked increase in total and
LDL cholesterol levels with an increased atherosclerotic lesion size in
Apoe-/- mice with antibiotic-induced depletion of the gut microbiota
as compared to conventionally raised Apoe-/- mice. These findings
support a functional role of gut microbiota-dependent metabolic
pathways in the control of blood cholesterol levels and atherogenesis. In particular, we show here that the SCFA propionate (PA) regulates intestinal expression of the intestinal cholesterol transporter of
Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) by increasing IL-10 levels in the

cholesterol levels and attenuates the development of atherosclerosis.
The clinical relevance of our experimental findings was demonstrated
in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept trial validating the LDL cholesterol-lowering effect of oral supplementation of
propionate in hypercholesterolaemic human subjects. Thus, lowering
LDL cholesterol with potential atheroprotective effects by supplementary PA treatment may represent a novel application of a
microbiota-derived metabolite. However, further studies are
required to evaluate long-term effects of PA on the development of
atherosclerosis in humans.
Atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases are a major global health
care burden and a leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide.1 Atherosclerosis starts frequently early in life35 and further progresses resulting in clinical ACVDs depending on lifetime exposure

to both genetic and environmental causal risk factors.36 Extensive evidence from epidemiologic, genetic, and clinical intervention studies
has shown that LDL is causal in this process.37 Thus, lowering LDL
cholesterol levels is a cornerstone in the prevention of the development and progression of ACVDs.2
In addition to traditional cardiovascular risk factors, in recent years,
distinct changes in gut microbial composition have been described in
the setting of atherosclerotic CVD in a number of case-controlled
studies.34 A large metagenome-wide association study on stools
from individuals with atherosclerotic CVD and healthy controls demonstrated an increased abundance of Enterobacteriaceae and
Streptococcus spp. and relatively depleted butyrate and propionateproducing bacteria in patients with atherosclerotic CVD, suggesting a
functional role of SCFAs in promoting cardiovascular health.38 In the
vasculature, propionate was demonstrated to mediate vasodilating
effects by activating the G protein-coupled receptor 41 in the vascular endothelium and thereby lower blood pressure.10
In recent experimental studies, PA was shown to promote the repair capacity after myocardial infarction39 and protect against hypertensive and ischaemic cardiac injury22 by maintaining immune
homeostasis. Although the underlying mechanisms are not fully
understood, intestinal and systemic immune modulation appear to
contribute to PA-related cardioprotection. Our observations expand
on the recently reported immunomodulatory effects of propionate
in the small intestine20,21 and link the immune-regulatory elements
with intestinal lipid control. Our findings reveal a novel regulatory circuit in which PA-induced increases in IL-10, the key Treg cytokine, in

the intestinal microenvironment suppress small intestinal NPC1L1
expression, which in turn decreases intestinal cholesterol absorption.
Consequently, the resulting decrease in circulatory LDL cholesterol
levels attenuates the progression of atherosclerosis in hypercholesterolaemic Apoe-/- mice. This hypothesis is further supported by the
reversal of the PA-induced effects on cholesterol control and atherosclerosis upon blockade of IL-10 receptor signalling, demonstrating
that the underlying mechanism relies on IL-10 signalling in intestinal
epithelial cells. Notably, the intestinal immune system, specifically distinct subsets (integrin b7th) of gut intraepithelial T lymphocytes, has
been recently recognized to modulate systemic metabolism, including circulating cholesterol levels.31 Our findings support the notion
that the intestinal immune cell compartment may serve as a novel target to control lipid metabolism.
Our observations align with previous studies showing an increase
in Treg number and function by supplementary PA treatment.21
Mechanistically, it was shown that PA augments the functional capacity of Tregs with increased IL-10 production by enhancing mitochondrial respiration. Moreover, ex vivo transcriptome and network
connectivity analyses in peripheral blood cells from PA-treated subjects revealed up-regulation of T-cell receptor-associated genes such
as CD3e and CD28 in combination with key cofactors in T-cell activation, such as IL-2 receptor alpha chain, with IL-10 as one of the
major gene interaction hubs.21
Importantly, a cholesterol-lowering effect has been attributed to
IL-10 in clinical studies testing recombinant human IL-10, e.g. in autoimmune and neoplastic diseases.40,41 However, the underlying pathway of IL-10-mediated regulation of lipid metabolism remains
unclear. Our findings reveal a novel regulatory role of IL-10 in intestinal cholesterol absorption by impacting the expression of NPC1L1.
Importantly, unlike systemic immunotherapy with recombinant IL-10,
local enrichment of IL-10 in the intestinal microenvironment by supplementary PA treatment may prevent adverse side effects while
promoting cardiovascular health and atheroprotection.
Notably, PA has been recently reported to stimulate glycogenolysis and hyperglycaemia by increasing plasma concentrations of glucagon and FABP4 through activation of the sympathetic nervous
system thereby increasing the risk of insulin resistance.42 Notably, in
our study, PA did affect neither plasma concentrations of glucagon
nor FABP4. These results together with unaltered fasting glucose and
HbA1C levels under PA treatment suggest that PA treatment with
the dosage and duration used in our study does not affect glucose
metabolism. The SCFAs PA and butyrate have also been shown in
previous studies to activate intestinal gluconeogenesis via a gut-brain
neural circuit involving the fatty acid receptor FFAR3.43 However,
this mechanism was suggested to rather promote metabolic benefits
in energy homeostasis with reduced adiposity and body weight and
better glucose control, including a decrease of hepatic glucose production. Taken together, PA may have diverse effects on glucose control depending on the site of action. Notably, in the current study,
many of the study participants from both groups were obese.
However, we did not observe any relevant weight alteration in
human study participants after 8 weeks PA treatment. This finding
may indicate that in humans the cholesterol-lowering property of PA,
at least in the short term, is not coupled with weight reduction.

Limitations of the study
A potential limitation of the clinical study is the rather short duration
of PA treatment of 8 weeks. Thus, it cannot be ruled out that PAmediated effects may be counteracted by potential negative feedback
mechanisms upon long-term application. This needs to be further
examined in future studies. Furthermore, the experimental findings
were obtained using female mice, and in the clinical trial, the majority
is represented by women. However, in a subanalysis of our study cohort, we observed a significant cholesterol-lowering effect also in
male study participants upon treatment with PA indicating that the
effects are sex-independent. Nevertheless, the sex-independent
cholesterol-lowering effects of PA remain to be further confirmed in
larger studies.
Although we did not find an alteration in the gut microbial profile
upon treatment with PA, it cannot be excluded that the metabolic activity and functional property of distinct bacterial species may be
altered in response to oral application of PA and, at least partly, contribute to the lipid-regulatory effects of PA, since distinct bacterial
strains, such as Lactobacillus strains, known to metabolize propionate, have also cholesterol-lowering properties.33

size from our previous work based on the effect of propionate on intestinal Tregs.20 The mice were maintained on a 12:12-h day: night
cycle with constant access to food and water. Adult (16 weeks of
age) female C57BL/6J, Apoe-/- (Charles River) were age-matched and
randomly assigned to either a SCD diet (n = 12) (crude fat 4.1%, cholesterol 14 mg/kg; Ssniff, Soest, Germany, E15000) or an HFD (n = 23)
(crude fat 34.6%, cholesterol 290 mg/kg; Ssniff, Soest, Germany,
E1574) for a total of 6 weeks. To study the effect of propionate (PA),
calcium propionate (150 mM, Sigma-Aldrich) was administered daily
via oral gavage for 4 weeks starting after 2 weeks of HFD (HFD th PA,
n = 13). Administration of SCFAs by oral gavage has been shown to
effectively increase plasma SCFA levels.44 The mice that were not
treated with PA received the vehicle (0.9% sodium chloride) alone
(n = 10). Inhibition of IL-10 receptor signalling during the period of
PA treatment was achieved by intraperitoneal injection of an anti-IL-

Thus, further long-term studies are warranted to address the longterm metabolic effects of supplementary PA treatment examining
glucose, cholesterol, and weight control.
Beyond the atheroprotective role of PA, future studies should
evaluate the effects of distinct SCFA on hepatic steatosis and broader
analyses of hepatic signalling involved in SCFA-dependent cholesterol
metabolism and synthesis should require more attention.
In conclusion, our observations suggest a novel mechanism linking
propionate-mediated effects on the gut immune system to intestinal
cholesterol regulation, through which exogenous propionate modulates intestinal cholesterol absorption, thereby lowering blood LDL
and total cholesterol levels. The clinical relevance of our experimental observations was demonstrated in a proof-of-concept clinical
study highlighting the gut immune system as a potential therapeutic
target for cardiovascular prevention in humans. Augmentation of intestinal propionate, e.g. by oral supplementation or diet-based strategies, may provide a novel approach to modulate the intestinal
immune system and thereby promote cardiovascular health and prevent atherosclerotic CVD. Further studies are needed to evaluate its
long-term metabolic effects and consequences on cardiovascular
outcome.

Generation of secondary abiotic mice
To generate secondary abiotic mice, quintuple antibiotic treatment
(thABS) was applied for 6 weeks. For this, mice were transferred to
sterile cages and treated with a mixture of ampicillin plus sulbactam
(1 g/L), vancomycin (500 mg/L), ciprofloxacin (200 mg/L), imipenem
(250 mg/L), and metronidazole (1 g/L) in the drinking water. The intestinal colonization status of the mice was controlled once a week
by highly sensitive cultural analysis of faecal samples. As early as
3 weeks after the start of broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment, quality controls indicated complete eradication of the intestinal microbiota, validated by negative results from both culture and molecular
detection of bacteria using real-time PCR targeting the bacterial 16S
rRNA genes. The mice were continuously kept in a sterile environment (autoclaved food and drinking water, sterile filtered antibiotic

Relative expression (triple determination) was examined by TaqMan
Gene Expression Master Mix (Applied BiosystemsTM; 4369542) following the manufacturer's instructions.

Reverse transcription-polymerase chain
reaction
Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used to detect
the expression of IL10 receptor 1 (IL10R1) in small intestinal organoids. The following gene-specific primer pairs for mouse IL-10R1 and
IL-10R2 were manufactured by TIB Molbiol (TIB MOLBIOL
Syntheselabor GmbH): IL-10R1: sense 50 AGG CAG AGG CAG
CAG GCC CAG CAG AAT GCT 30 , antisense 50 TGG AGC CTG
GCT AGC TGG TCA CAG TAG GTC 30 ; IL-10R2: sense, 50 GCC
AGC TCT AGG AAT GAT TC 30 , antisense 50 AAT GTT CTT CAA
GGT CCA C 30 .46 The mixture for each reaction was composed of
primers (sense and antisense, 10 mM each), BD (Rapidozym; GENOPTI-500), MgCl2th (25 mM; Rapidozym; GEN-OPTI-500), dNTPs
(10 mM; Rapidozym; GEN-009-250), and Taq polymerase (5 U/mL;
Rapidozym; GEN-OPTI-500) following the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA (2 mL) and RNase-free water were added to reach a volume of 20 mL per well. PCR was performed with an initial
denaturation at 95 C for 2 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation
at 95 C for 30 s, annealing at 64 C for 30 s and extension at 72 C for
1 min. After complete amplification, DNA loading buffer (TaKaRaTM;
639285) was added, and the PCR products were visualized by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel (Agarose; ServaTM; 11406.02)
(including 20 mL of ethidium bromide and 90 mL of 1 Tris-acetateEDTA-buffer). PeqGOLD DNA Ladder Mix (VWR Life ScienceTM;
25-2040) served as a molecular weight reference band following the
manufacturer's instructions.

Quantitative polymerase chain reaction
For quantitative polymerase chain reaction, total RNA from the liver
and ileum was isolated with TRIzol reagent (InvitrogenTM; 15596026)
following the manufacturer's instructions and quantified using absorbance measurements on a NanoDrop (Thermo ScientificTM; ND-2000).
Enzymatic DNA digestion was performed on total RNA from both tissues using RNase-free DNase I (1 U/mg; Thermo ScientificTM; EN0251).
Total RNA (1.0 mg) was used for the reverse transcription of hepatic
RNA using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit
(Applied BiosystemsTM; 4368814), and 0.7 mg of total RNA was used
for the reverse transcription of RNA from intestinal tissue using the
High-Capacity RNA-to-cDNA Kit (Applied BiosystemsTM; 4388950).
For intestinal organoids, cDNA synthesis and pre-amplification
were performed using the SMART-PCR approach.45 In brief, 100 ng
of total RNA was mixed with 1 mM dNTPs (Thermo Fisher) and
10 mM of oligo-dT primer (50 -AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGA
GTACT30VN-30 , where 'N' is any base and 'V' is either 'A', 'C', or
'G'; Biomers), denatured and placed on ice. Then, the first-strand synthesis for each sample was achieved using 5 U/lL Maxima H minus
reverse transcriptase (200 U/lL, Invitrogen), 1 U/lL Recombinant
RNasin Ribonuclease Inhibitor (PROMEGA), 1 SuperScript VI
Reverse Transcriptase (5, Thermo fisher), 1 M betaine (5 M,
Sigma), 10 mM MgCl2th (1 mM, Thermo fisher), 1 lM ISPCR-TSO
(Template Switching Oligos): 50 -AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCA
GAGTACATrGrGthG-30 ; two riboguanosines (rG) and one LNAmodified guanosine (thG), and nuclease-free water (Invitrogen).
Subsequently, the reverse transcriptase was inactivated, and an
adapter-based PCR pre-amplification was carried out using 1 KAPA
HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (2, KAPA ROCHE), 200 nM ISPCR primers (10 lM, 50 AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGT-30 , Biomers)
and nuclease-free water (Invitrogen). Finally, cDNA was treated with
Exonuclease I (NEB) following the manufacturer's instructions.
Relative mRNA expression of hepatic genes (Cyp7a1, Fxr, Hmgcr,
Ldlr, Srebp2, Pcsk9), intestinal genes (Abca1, Abcg5, Acat2, Asbt, Npc1l1,
and Srb1), and the reference gene Gapdh was analysed using TaqMan
Gene Expression Assays with the following primers (Applied
BiosystemsTM; 4351372):

performed by a two-tailed unpaired t-test and Mann-Whitney U test,
as appropriate. To compare >2 groups, one-way ANOVA followed
by post hoc Tukey's test was performed. Significance was assumed at
a two-sided *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, or ***P < 0.001.

Human study

Gut microbiota
The statistical analyses and graphical representations of the microbiota were performed using R v.3.5.147 with packages phyloseq
v.1.2649 and ggplot2 v.3. The compositional dissimilarity of the dataset was investigated using the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity metric calculated on proportion-normalized data using the vegdist function from
the vegan package. Principal Coordinate Analysis plots were created
using the made4 and ggplot2 packages. Permutational MANOVA
statistical tests on the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity were performed using
the adonis function from the vegan package with 1000 permutations;
significance was assumed for P-value <0.05. Changes in community
diversity were investigated using Shannon Diversity metrics using the
estimate_richness function in the phyloseq package.

Treatment groups were compared based on analyses of covariance,
with difference between measurement at T2 and T0 as the dependent variable, adjusting for measurement at T0. For safety endpoints,
we calculated univariate logistic regression models. A two-sided significance level of 5% was applied for all analyses. As we did not correct for multiple testing for secondary endpoints, P-values for
secondary endpoints have to be interpreted as exploratory analyses.
The primary approach to handle missing values was multiple imputation for all endpoints with <40% missing values. As a sensitivity analysis, we also performed a multiple imputation by treatment group
for the primary endpoint, and complete-case analyses for all
endpoints.
