Aims

This study aimed to assess the clinical characteristics and long-term survival outcome in patients with Takayasu's
arteritis-associated pulmonary hypertension (TA-PH).

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
We conducted a nationally representative cohort study of TA-PH using data from the National Rare Diseases
and results
Registry System of China. Patients with pulmonary artery involvement who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of
Takayasu's arteritis and pulmonary hypertension were included. The primary outcome was the time from diagnosis
of TA-PH to the occurrence of all-cause death. Between January 2007 and January 2019, a total of 140 patients
were included, with a mean age of 41.4 years at diagnosis, and a female predominance (81%). Patients with TA-PH
had severely haemodynamic and functional impairments at diagnosis. Significant improvements have been found in
N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and haemodynamic profiles in patients with TA-PH receiving drugs approved for pulmonary arterial hypertension. The overall 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates in TA-PH

were 94.0%, 83.2%, and 77.2%, respectively. Predictors associated with an increased risk of all-cause death were
syncope [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 5.38 (95% confidence interval 1.77-16.34), P = 0.003], NT-proBNP level
[adjusted HR 1.04 (1.03-1.06), P < 0.001], and mean right atrial pressure [adjusted HR 1.07 (1.01-1.13), P = 0.015].

Conclusion
Patients with TA-PH were predominantly female and had severely compromised haemodynamics. More than 80%

of patients in our cohort survived for at least 3 years. Medical treatment was based on investigators' personal opinions, and no clear risk-to-benefit ratio can be derived from the presented data.

Pulmonary artery involvement

Introduction
Takayasu's arteritis, which predominantly involves the aorta and its
major branches, is a primary and granulomatous vasculitis of unknown origin.1,2 It is characterized by infiltrative inflammation in the
vessel wall, resulting in varying lesions of wall thickening, stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm. The disorder is distributed worldwide, affecting
both genders, but it disproportionally affects young women and the
Asian population.3 The clinical manifestations of Takayasu's arteritis
are usually nonspecific and remarkably heterogeneous, depending on
the affected vessels and the severity of disease progression.4,5
In recent years, pulmonary Takayasu's arteritis has been recognized as pulmonary artery involvement in Takayasu's arteritis.6,7 The
occurrence of pulmonary artery involvement was not rare in patients
with Takayasu's arteritis.4,8-10 Approximately half of patients with
Takayasu's arteritis-associated pulmonary artery involvement suffer
from overt pulmonary hypertension (PH) during their courses, which
is mostly secondary to pulmonary artery stenosis or occlusion.11,12
Furthermore, the concomitant systemic artery involvement could

theoretically cause post-capillary PH in a subset of patients with
Takayasu's arteritis-associated pulmonary artery involvement.
Haemodynamic assessment based on right heart catheterization was,
therefore, essential for accurate diagnosis and subsequent classification
of PH. In the real world, patients with Takayasu's arteritis-associated
PH (TA-PH) always experience delayed diagnosis due to nonspecific
clinical manifestations and lack of attention regarding early symptoms
of impaired pulmonary circulation. Up to now, information on clinical
characteristics and long-term outcomes of patients with TA-PH is only
from case series and small cohort studies, with their determination of
PH commonly dependent on echocardiography.11-13 Clinical phenotyping, by invasive haemodynamics, of patients with TA-PH is still not
well established. The huge knowledge gap in the current international
guidelines and recommendations has largely impeded the clinical management of patients with TA-PH.14-16
Therefore, this multicentre cohort study was conducted to assess
the clinical features, especially the haemodynamic characteristics, of
patients with TA-PH, as well as to evaluate their long-term survival
outcomes and identify prognostic factors for all-cause death.

Methods
Study cohort

Data sources
Data on patient characteristics at first admission for TA-PH diagnosis
were collected, including demographic information, clinical symptoms,
medical history, World Health Organization (WHO) functional class, 6min walking distance, serological testing, vascular involvement, echocardiographic findings, invasive haemodynamics, and treatments. An elevated inflammatory marker was defined as C-reactive protein (CRP)
>5 mg/L or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) >20 mm/h at the diagnosis of TA-PH, after any causes other than arteritis were excluded. The
presence of left heart disease in patients with TA-PH was identified by
echocardiography measuring left atrial or ventricular enlargement, moderate or severe left heart valve disease, or a left ventricular ejection fraction of <50%. Multidisciplinary teams consisting of senior
rheumatologists, cardiologists, and radiologists were established to collectively make the decisions regarding Takayasu's arteritis related therapies, including the use, timing, and dosage of corticosteroids and
immunosuppressants. Drugs approved for PAH (endothelin receptor
antagonists, phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors, and prostacyclin derivatives) were given to patients according to the clinical judgement and discretion of the individual treating physicians.

Clinical assessment and follow-up
Follow-ups were conducted on all patients via clinic visits, phone calls, or
online interviews. The primary outcome was the time from the diagnosis of
TA-PH to the occurrence of all-cause death. The data from the first clinical
and haemodynamic assessments after enrolment were collected to analyse
the therapeutic effects of drugs approved for PAH on patients with TA-PH.

We conducted a multicentre cohort study using the clinical, functional,
and haemodynamic data from the National Rare Diseases Registry
System of China (https://nrdrs.org.cn). The system is a nationwide registration of rare diseases, created in 2016 at Peking Union Medical College
Hospital with contributions from other academic institutions.17 Patients
with rare types of PH, including but not limited to group one pulmonary
arterial hypertension (PAH), chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), and arteritis-associated PH, were routinely registered
(NCT03169010).
Patients with TA-PH who were registered for this study were geographically located in 13 PH referral centres and situated in 10 provinces or
municipalities of China. All patients were included between January 2007
and January 2019, based on the following procedures. First, the diagnosis
of Takayasu's arteritis was completed according to the Ishikawa criteria
modified by Sharma and/or the 1990 American College of Rheumatology
criteria.18,19 Second, pulmonary artery involvement was determined by either of the two imaging modalities, i.e. computed tomography pulmonary
angiography or transcatheter pulmonary angiography. Typical pulmonary
artery involvement included stenosis, occlusion, dilation, or aneurysm.
Representative images of pulmonary artery involvement in patients with
TA-PH are presented in Supplementary material online, Figure S1. We
excluded patients with pulmonary artery involvement caused by nonTakayasu's arteritis, such as other types of vasculitis (e.g. Behcet's disease,
giant cell arteritis and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody associatedvasculitis), CTEPH, pulmonary artery sarcoma, fibrosing mediastinitis, pulmonary sarcoidosis, or schistosomiasis. Finally, all patients received standard right heart catheterization in accordance with current guidelines.16 The
study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and
approved by the local ethics committee of each participating institution. All
patients gave their written informed consent.

..
.. (10.8 +/- 6.4 Wood U) (Table 1). According to the classification of PH,

(95% confidence interval 67.8-87.9), respectively.

Long-term survival
Eight out of the 140 patients (6%) were lost to follow-up. The median
follow-up time was 24 (IQR 9-56) months. Death was recorded in
20 patients, with overall 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates of 94.0%
(95% CI 90.0-98.4), 83.2% (95% CI 75.4-91.7), and 77.2% (95% CI
67.8-87.9), respectively (Figure 2). The causes of death were right
heart failure (n = 17), sudden cardiac death (n = 1), massive haemoptysis (n = 1), and lung infection (n = 1). We did not observe any significant differences in survival rates between patients with normal and
elevated inflammation markers (log-rank P = 0.310).

Risk factors for all-cause death
In univariate analyses, 12 baseline variables were associated with allcause death (Table 3). Three significant predictors were retained,

following backward-stepwise variable selection, in the final multivariate Cox regression model (Table 3). The factors associated with an
increased risk of all-cause death were the presence of syncope
[adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 5.38, 95% CI 1.77-16.34, P = 0.003],
increased NT-proBNP level (adjusted HR per 100 pg/mL 1.04, 95%
CI 1.03-1.06, P < 0.001), and elevated mean right atrial pressure
(adjusted HR per 1 mm Hg 1.07, 95% CI 1.01-1.13, P = 0.015). The
Cox model, with the three significant predictors, was also estimated
as a sensitivity analysis, based on the complete cases, and similar
results were observed (see Supplementary material online, Table S2).

Discussion
As far as we know, this is the first multicentre cohort study with a
large enough sample size to establish clinical features and long-term
prognosis of patients with TA-PH, based on diagnostic right heart
catheterization. We found that patients with TA-PH presented with
a severely compromised function status and haemodynamics at diagnosis. In a subset of 92 patients who completed the first clinical
assessments, significant improvements were found in NT-proBNP,
mean pulmonary artery pressure, cardiac index, and pulmonary vascular resistance after treatment of PAH medications. Patients with
TA-PH had an estimated 3-year survival rate of 83.2%, and most of
them died due to right heart failure. Furthermore, the syncope symptom, NT-proBNP, and mean right atrial pressure were found to be
significantly associated with all-cause death (Graphical Abstract ).
Takayasu's arteritis has been known to mainly affect young females
at their second and third decades of life. In our cohort, female predominance in patients with TA-PH was consistent with that in
Takayasu's arteritis populations.2,5 However, the onset time of first
PH-associated symptom seems to be 5-10 years later than the occurrence of Takayasu's arteritis.20,21 Given that the symptoms of patients
with TA-PH are usually insidious and nonspecific, diagnosis delay was
common, with a median of 2 years in our study.8 Tuberculosis

infection was found in 19% of patients with TA-PH, which was largely
in parallel with a previous study.22 Observational data have shown
that tuberculosis is related to more frequent pulmonary artery involvement and more chest discomfort in patients with Takayasu's arteritis,23 but there is still little known about the role of tuberculosis
infection in the development and progression of Takayasu's arteritis
and TA-PH.
The prevalence of haemoptysis in patients with TA-PH (36%) is
relatively high, and in accordance with a previous report.13 The
suspected causes for haemoptysis are inconclusive, but potentially
include the rupture of collateral vessels or micro-aneurysms,
hypertensive response, or pulmonary infarction.24 Moreover, frequent anticoagulant usage in this study may have facilitated the
high rate of haemoptysis. In clinical practice, anticoagulants have
been empirically used for the prophylaxis of in situ thrombosis,
which was not rare in patients with TA-PH.12 However, the risk-
benefit analysis for anticoagulation treatment should be further
investigated.
Despite notable divergences in underlying causes of pulmonary
vascular obstruction, TA-PH, and CTEPH might share similar pathophysiological mechanisms in pre-capillary PH development, such as
pulmonary vascular bed loss by mechanical obstruction and secondary remodelling of unobstructed vessels.25 In addition, elevated pulmonary artery wedge pressure was also identified in some patients
with TA-PH, which could possibly be attributed to the impairments
of systolic or diastolic left ventricular function due to hypertension
secondary to extensive systemic artery stenosis. However, in view of
the fact that left heart disease only existed in a fraction of patients
with elevated pulmonary artery wedge pressure, most if not all cases
of elevated pulmonary artery wedge pressure were probably due to
false measurement caused by central pulmonary artery involvement.
Moreover, elevated CRP and ESR levels were observed separately
in 31% and 24% of patients with TA-PH. We also found that patients

with a normal level of inflammatory makers had a higher mean pulmonary artery pressure. The active inflammation was commonly
seen in the early stages of Takayasu's arteritis and tapered with frequent relapse in the late stages. Patients with Takayasu's arteritisassociated pulmonary artery involvement but not PH were indicated
at the early and active inflammatory stage, suggesting a shorter disease course, a higher level of ESR, and a higher incidence of subpleural wedge-shaped shadows, compared to those with TA-PH.8 We
hence assumed that patients with normal inflammatory markers
might have a longer clinical course of Takayasu's arteritis and present
with more severe pulmonary vascular remodelling in comparison to
those with elevated inflammatory markers.
Despite limited data, a number of "real-world" patients with precapillary PH have been prescribed drugs approved for PAH. In the
current study, we found significant post-treatment improvements in
NT-proBNP level and pulmonary haemodynamics in patients with
TA-PH receiving drugs approved for PAH. Nevertheless, these findings should be interpreted with caution especially considering that
the study design and sample size could not provide sufficient evidence. The dispensing of drugs approved for PAH based on investigators' personal opinions also made the interpretation of results
difficult. Future prospective, controlled trials are warranted to identify the risk-to-benefit ratio of drugs approved for PAH for patients
with TA-PH. In addition, the established treatment strategies for
CTEPH, i.e. pulmonary endarterectomy and balloon pulmonary
angioplasty, might also be treatment options that need to be further
explored for patients with TA-PH.
In this study, we observed that the 3-year survival rate of TA-PH
was 83.2%, which was poorer than the overall survival rate in the
Takayasu's arteritis cohort.26 PH-associated right heart failure was
the main cause of death in patients with TA-PH, differing from left
heart failure and vascular complications which substantially contributed to death in patients with Takayasu's arteritis. In the multivariate

Cox model, we identified syncope symptoms, NT-proBNP, and
mean right atrial pressure as factors independently associated with
all-cause death in patients with TA-PH. These markers presented a
strong relationship with PH phenotype, and their prognostic value
has been reported in current PH guidelines.16 Furthermore, these
findings suggest that PH per se, instead of Takayasu's arteritis related
factors like systemic artery involvement or inflammatory markers,
was the key factor for long-term prognosis of TA-PH.

Some limitations of our study need to be acknowledged. First, this
study was limited by its small number of patients. Given the sample
size and number of events, the study may fail to reach statistical
power, therefore, the findings should be considered as hypothesisgenerating rather than as definitive evidence. However, patient
recruitment for such rare diseases is difficult, and the current study
performed in 13 referral centres of China represents the largest cohort of TA-PH to date. Second, we included Takayasu's arteritis
patients with well-defined pulmonary artery involvement and PH
phenotypes; therefore, the generalization of our findings to patients
with only Takayasu's arteritis-associated pulmonary artery involvement should be considered with caution. Third, it should be noted
that pulmonary artery wedge pressure in some patients was possibly
overestimated due to the presence of stenosis/obstruction in the
proximal pulmonary arteries. Last but not least, limited by treatment
heterogeneity of drugs approved for PAH and potential confounding
factors, this study could not provide sufficient information on the
risk-to-benefit ratio of drugs approved for PAH in patients with TAPH.

Conclusions
In this first multicentre cohort study of TA-PH with invasive
haemodynamic diagnoses, we found that patients with TA-PH
were predominantly female and had severely compromised
haemodynamics. We further found that >80% of patients were
able to survive for 3 years from diagnosis. Medical treatment was
based on investigators' personal opinions and no clear risk-tobenefit ratio can be derived from the presented data. These findings provide new insights into this specific PH entity and call for
future therapeutic trials to improve the prognosis of patients with
TA-PH.
