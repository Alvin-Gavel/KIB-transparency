Aims

Patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE) at low risk for short-term death are candidates for home treatment or
short-hospital stay. We aimed at determining whether the assessment of right ventricle dysfunction (RVD) or elevated
troponin improves identification of low-risk patients over clinical models alone.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
Individual patient data meta-analysis of studies assessing the relationship between RVD or elevated troponin and shortand results

term mortality in patients with acute PE at low risk for death based on clinical models (Pulmonary Embolism Severity
Index, simplified Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index or Hestia). The primary study outcome was short-term death
defined as death occurring in hospital or within 30 days. Individual data of 5010 low-risk patients from 18 studies were
pooled. Short-term mortality was 0.7% [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.4-1.3]. RVD at echocardiography, computed
tomography or B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)/N-terminal pro BNP (NT-proBNP) was associated with increased risk
for short-term death (1.5 vs. 0.3%; OR 4.81, 95% CI 1.98-11.68), death within 3 months (1.6 vs. 0.4%; OR 4.03, 95% CI
2.01-8.08), and PE-related death (1.1 vs. 0.04%; OR 22.9, 95% CI 2.89-181). Elevated troponin was associated with
short-term death (OR 2.78, 95% CI 1.06-7.26) and death within 3 months (OR 3.68, 95% CI 1.75-7.74).

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
RVD assessed by echocardiography, computed tomography, or elevated BNP/NT-proBNP levels and increased troponin are associated with short-term death in patients with acute PE at low risk based on clinical models. RVD assessment, mainly by BNP/NT-proBNP or echocardiography, should be considered to improve identification of low-risk
patients that may be candidates for outpatient management or short hospital stay.

Introduction
Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a potentially life-threatening disease.1
The presentation of acute PE varies from acute shock or cardiac arrest (about 5-10% of patients) to a stable condition with mild symptoms and absence of relevant comorbidities (about 30-40% of
patients), through hemodynamically stable disease with some evidence of right ventricle dysfunction (RVD) or elevated troponin
(about 50-60% of patients).2,3 Current guidelines from the European
Society of Cardiology classify these three groups as patients with
acute PE at high, low, or intermediate risk for short-term death.4
In recent years, several efforts were made to identify PE patients at
low risk of death, also to inform decisions on home treatment or
short hospital stay and on acute treatment strategies. Several clinical
prognostic models, mostly based on clinical variables, were developed to identify PE patients at low risk of death.5,6 The Pulmonary
Embolism Severity Index (PESI) and its simplified version (sPESI) are
the most validated and currently used models (Supplementary material online, Table S1). The expected 30-day mortality in patients classified as low risk according to the PESI or sPESI is about 1% (upper
95% confidence limit 1.6% for PESI class I and 3.5% for PESI class II;
upper 95% confidence limit 2.1% for sPESI).5 In recent years, a more
pragmatic approach using the Hestia criteria has been proposed and
validated in prospective studies on home treatment in patients with
acute PE (Supplementary material online, Table S2).7 In patients with
none of the Hestia criteria who were managed as outpatients, the 90day mortality was 1% (upper confidence limit 2.9%).

More than 30% of patients at low risk for death according to clinic..

We conducted an individual patient data meta-analysis (IPDMA)

online.

Study selection

Study outcomes
The primary study outcome is the point incidence of short-term all-cause
mortality. Short term is defined as death occurring in hospital or within
30 days following the diagnosis of acute PE, as reported in the individual
studies. The secondary outcomes are the point incidence of death and of
PE-related death occurring up to 3 months.

Data extraction and quality assessment
Corresponding authors or first author of eligible studies were invited
to participate in this collaborative project. Study-level information
was sought on: setting of patients' accrual (emergency department vs.
hospitalized patients), strategy for definition of low risk for death
(PESI, sPESI, or Hestia criteria), prospective or retrospective design,
observational or management study, strategy for right ventricle assessment (imaging or biomarkers), duration of follow-up (in-hospital,
30 days, or 90 days), and study outcome (all-cause death or PE-related
death). For studies reporting mortality occurring both during in-hospital stay and at 30 days, 30-day mortality was considered for the primary outcome analysis.
The following patient-level data were requested: demographics
(age in years, sex); clinical features at presentation [systolic blood

.. pressure (sBP) in mmHg, heart rate (HR) in b.p.m., respiratory rate
..
.. (RR) in breaths/min, oxygen saturation, temperature in  C, altered
.. mental status (defined as disorientation, lethargy, stupor, or coma)];
..
.. comorbidities (cancer, heart failure, chronic lung disease); results of
.. assessment by PESI, sPESI, or Hestia criteria, imaging of the right ven.. tricle (performed or not performed, performed by CT and/or echo..
.. cardiography, RVD present or absent); biomarkers (tested or not
.. tested, elevated or normal); and clinical outcome (dead or alive, PE..
.. related death).
..
Individual databases were merged in a pooled electronic database that
..
.. was housed at the University of Perugia. PESI and sPESI assessments were
.. recalculated for each patient. Variables were identified, measurements
..
.. verified, and comparisons with individual reports were made.
.. Discrepancies with the published data were resolved by contacting the
..
.. principal investigators.
..
All studies had been approved by the institutional review boards of
..
.. participating centres.
..
Risk of bias was assessed by the use of the QUIPS tool.13
..
..
..
..
.. Data synthesis and analysis
.. IPDMA was carried out preserving the clustering of individual participant
..
.. data of patients within studies. Summary probability estimates were cal.. culated by one-stage meta-analysis using a generalized linear mixed..
.. effects model, in which a study-specific random effect was included to ac.. count for the clustering of patients within studies.14 The overall effect es..
.. timate of presence vs. absence of RVD or elevated troponin was
.. calculated.
..
Subgroup differences were analysed with an indicator variable as a
..
.. fixed effect.
..
To illustrate heterogeneity across the studies, 95% prediction intervals
..
.. were calculated around the point estimates on the basis of the standard
..
.. error of the fixed effect and the variance of the random effect. Forest
.. plots were generated to visualize potential heterogeneity. The I-squared
..
.. statistic and Chi-square test were used to assess heterogeneity among in.. dividual odds ratios (ORs) for each included study.
..
We performed predefined sensitivity analyses for the primary study out..
.. come and the secondary study outcomes in order to assess the effect of:
..
.. (1) Study characteristics: timing of short-term death (in-hospital or 30
..
days), prospective vs. retrospective design;
..
.. (2) Patient characteristics: (i) age either as a continuous variable and by
..
groups (<50, 50-70, and >70 years), (ii) cancer, (iii) HR either as a
..
..
continuous variable and by groups (<100, 100-110, and >_110
..
b.p.m.), (iv) sBP either as a continuous variable and by groups (<100
..
..
and >_100 mmHg), (v) RR either as a continuous variable and by
..
groups (<20 and 20-30 breaths/min);
..
.. (3) Tests characteristics: PESI, sPESI, Hestia, CT angiography, echocar..
diography, troponin, and natriuretic peptides.
..
..
A confirmatory analysis of the study outcomes was also carried out via
..
.. a two-stage IPDMA and results are reported in the Supplementary ma..
.. terial online.
..
All analyses were performed in SPSS (version 25.0) and R [version
.. 3.3.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing), by using the lme4 package,
..
.. version 1.1-23, meta (version 4.11-0), and metafor (version 2.4-0)
.. packages].

Two investigators (G.M. and C.B.) independently screened all titles and
abstracts of identified records, according to the inclusion criteria.
Subsequently, the two authors independently assessed full-text publications of selected articles. Reference lists of eligible articles were handsearched. Disagreement was resolved by discussion or by consulting a
third author (D.J.) when necessary. For duplicate publications, the most
recent was considered.
The study protocol was registered in PROSPERO 2020
(CRD42020197900).
Studies were considered eligible for this analysis if they fulfilled all
the following criteria: (i) inclusion of patients with confirmed acute PE
categorized as at 'low risk' by means of clinical models (PESI class I or
II, sPESI <1 or absence of Hestia criteria) regardless of the presence/
absence of RVD at imaging [echocardiography or computed tomography (CT) angiography] or elevated biomarkers [N-terminal pro Btype natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), B-type natriuretic peptide
(BNP)], or troponin; (ii) assessment of RVD at imaging (echocardiography or CT angiography) or NT-proBNP, BNP or troponin; and (iii)
reporting on death (either all-cause or PE-related) occurring during
the hospital stay, at 30 or 90 days in patients with or without RVD
and/or elevated or normal troponin.
Studies were excluded from the analysis in case of: (i) inclusion of <30
patients and (ii) unavailability of individual patient data after a request was
made to the authors.
RVD at presentation was defined according to the criteria used in
the original studies either at echocardiography or CT angiography.
Elevated plasma levels of NT-proBNP or BNP or cardiac troponins
[troponin I (TnI) or T (TnT), by standard or high-sensitivity (hs)
assays] were defined according to assays and cut-off levels adopted in
the original studies.

Our search identified 5370 papers. After study selection, 36 studies
were identified as fulfilling the inclusion criteria (Figure 1). After direct
contact with authors, individual patient data from 18 studies (8948
patients) were made available, merged in a pooled database, and
included in the study.8,15-31 Eighteen eligible studies were not
included because the data were not made available,32-49 leading to
the inclusion in the analysis of about 70% of the potentially eligible
patients.
The main characteristics and RVD definitions of the 18 included
studies are described in Supplementary material online, Table S3. The
main features of studies included or not included in the IPDMA are
reported in Supplementary material online, Table S4.
Among the 18 included studies, PESI, sPESI and Hestia were used
to identify low-risk patients in seven, nine and one studies, respectively. In one study, assessment of low risk was based on either PESI,
sPESI, or Hestia.30 RVD assessment was reported by imaging in 15
studies (by echocardiography in seven, by CT angiography in two and
either echocardiography or CT angiography in six).8,15-18,20-23,25-31
BNP or NT-proBNP was determined in seven studies18,23-25,27,29,31
and troponin in 12 studies.8,15,16,18-20,22,23,25,27,29,31 Funnel plot inspection revealed no publication bias.
Among 8948 patients from 18 studies,8,15-31 5010 patients
were classified at low risk for death according to the recalculated
sPESI (3830 patients) or PESI (3483 patients) scores and were
included in the IPDMA. The main features of the included
patients are reported in Table 1. Main patient features by study
are reported in Supplementary material online, Table S5.
Notably, the mean age was 55 +/- 16 years and the prevalence of
comorbidities was low.

Sensitivity analyses
The role of sequential test for RV assessment is reported in Table 4.
No improvement in risk stratification for short-term death was
observed by the assessment of BNP/NT-proBNP in patients without
RVD on echocardiography. BNP/NT-proBNP assessment seems to
improve identification of low-risk patients when used with CT angiography or troponin. Similarly, echocardiography seems to improve
risk stratification when used in patients with no RVD at CT angiography or normal troponin levels.
The associations between RVD assessments and death occurring
within 3 months either in patients at low risk according to sPESI or in
patients at low risk according to PESI are reported in Table 5.
Presence of RVD at echocardiography, CT or BNP/NT-proBNP was
associated with increased risk for death in both patients at low risk
according to PESI and patients at low risk according to sPESI
(Supplementary material online, Table S6). RVD at CT angiography
was not associated with death occurring within 3 months in either
group.

Further sensitivity analyses in patients with RVD assessment available either by imaging or biomarkers are reported in Table 5. The
prospective or retrospective design did not influence the associations
between RVD or elevated troponin and death. The association between RVD and death was confirmed after exclusion of studies with
<50 patients.
No association was found between patient characteristics such as
age, gender, heart rate below or above 110 b.p.m. or respiratory rate

Our IPDMA, which included >5000 patients with acute PE at low risk
for death as determined by clinical scores, showed a short-term mortality of <1% (with an upper limit of the 95% CI of 1.3%) and a PErelated mortality of 0.4% (upper limit of the 95% CI of 1.5%). In these
patients, both all-cause mortality and PE-related mortality were

Identification of patients with acute PE at very low risk for death
has several clinical implications and among these are the options for
home treatment directly from the emergency department or after a
short hospital stay. In fact, our IPDMA did not assess the issue of
home treatment or short hospital stay, rather the accuracy of different methods for RV assessment in identifying a very low-risk population of patients with acute PE. By reinforcing the evidence on optimal
methods for identification of a group of patients with acute PE and
very low risk for death, and providing rates of short-term deaths and
PE-related deaths, our study can help clinicians on decision making

concerning patient disposition and drive further studies on home
treatment/short hospital stay. Indeed, recent studies have shown that
home treatment or short-term hospital stay are feasible in patients
with acute PE at low risk for death.7,50 However, home treatment is
underused in clinical practice as concerns still remain among physicians regarding the risk of adverse outcomes in the short course after
discharge. In this view, increased accuracy of risk stratification and
increased safety of the clinical course of patients may lessen concerns
about home treatment or short hospital stay.
Risk stratification, based on RVD by imaging or cardiac biomarkers
and troponin assessment, was consistently proven to be effective in
the general population of patients with PE,51-54 but its value in
patients with acute PE at low risk for death based on PESI or sPESI
remains unclear. Based on our IPDMA, it appears that identification
of patients with acute PE at low risk based on current clinical risk
scores could be further refined by RVD or troponin assessment. In

the present analysis of low-risk patients, those without RVD or with
normal troponin had a risk for death that was <0.5%. This risk
appears to be lower than that derived in low-risk patients by clinical
models based on clinical evaluation alone (1%).
In our IPDMA in low-risk PE patients based on clinical models, we
found a non-negligible prevalence of RVD of 30% if assessed by
echocardiography, CT angiography, or BNP/NT-proBNP and a
prevalence of elevated troponin of 20%. These prevalences translate to a proportion of >65% of patients without RVD that can still

safe candidates for management by home treatment or short hospital
stay. In the remaining patients with RVD or elevated troponin such
management strategies should probably be avoided or used with caution. In fact, in our study in patients with low-risk PE according to clinical models, short-term mortality in the presence of RVD or elevated
troponin may reach 5%. Based on these results, RVD assessment in
patients at low risk according to clinical models is able to identify a
subgroup of patients that, despite an apparent low risk for death, may
require attention and a subgroup at very low risk for death.50

low number of study outcome events. In fact, no deaths were
observed in some of the predefined subgroups. Moreover, these
results suggest that most of the clinical prognostic information is already captured by clinical prognostic scores. Whether risk stratification of low-risk patients can be further improved by better clinical
evaluation remains undefined. Concerning the potential role of sequential combination of tests for RV assessment, the association of
echocardiography or BNP/NT-proBNP can be useful in combination
with CT angiography or troponin; in this view, troponin seems to improve risk stratification obtained by echocardiography and vice versa.
However, absolute mortality rates seem quite low in almost all subgroups with a first negative test.
Our study had death as primary and secondary study outcomes.
Several recent studies also assessed clinical deterioration or treatment upgrading as undesirable clinical events. However, the definition
of clinical deterioration varies across studies and probably across
physicians. In this view, death is the hardest clinical event with no
chance for overestimation.
Recently, a study-level meta-analysis reported an association between RVD in patients with acute PE at low risk for death.9 In this
context, the IPDMA design used in our study allows adjustments for
confounding factors in observational studies.60 In our study, availability of individual patient data allowed the use of consistent criteria for
the definition of PE patients at low risk for death. Moreover, PESI and
sPESI were recalculated for each patient and disagreements with the
original assessment were resolved with the corresponding authors.
Missing data were accounted for at the individual level. IPDMA also
allows adjustment of estimates for baseline (prognostic) factors in
subgroup analyses. Finally, the IPDMA approach increases the power
of analyses in populations with low rates of study outcome events.
Our IPDMA was performed according to a one-stage method and
results were confirmed by a two-stage method. One-stage is by far
the most recommended methodology for IPDMA as it allows the use
of individual patient data while the two-stage method is still based on
aggregate comparisons.
Our study has some limitations. We were not able to obtain all the
available data for our IPDMA. Although this can be an issue in
IPDMA, the main features of included and excluded studies and their
results were comparable. More specifically, as reported in
Supplementary material online, Table S4, the provision of studies' individual patient data was unlikely to be associated with the significance of its results. Moreover, the rates of events in unavailable
studies seem to be comparable to those of the included studies
(Supplementary material online, Table S3). This could reduce the possibility of an availability bias. In regard to the prognostic assessment of
some individual methods for RV assessment, the low prevalence of
abnormal findings together with low rates of mortality would have
limited the power of the analyses to identify robust associations. This
limit is also reflected by the wideness of some CIs of individual estimates. However, as our IPDMA deals with patients at low risk for
death, our results largely improve estimates from individual studies.
Moreover, the relative sensitivity and specificity of echocardiography
and CT parameters of RV dysfunction, and of cut-off levels (e.g. 1.0
for the RV/LV ratio) are still controversial. Similarly, assays for troponin assessment varied across studies, some reporting on hs and some
on standard troponin. The observational nature of the included studies is an additional limit. However, observational cohorts are the

As death in patients with acute PE is related to acute RV overload,
it is clinically plausible that the assessment of RVD could have a role
in the risk stratification of these patients.
In terms of resource utilization, the issue remains whether a population with an expected all-cause mortality <1% requires further risk
stratification taking into account that use of clinical models such as
PESI or sPESI makes risk assessment rapid and feasible around the
clock. The number needed to test could be informative in this specific
issue and would lead to select echocardiography or BNP/NTproBNP for clinical practice. However, these numbers may have
been affected by differences among populations assessed with different tools for RVD.
Mortality was shown to be low in all groups of patients without
RVD, whatever the strategy used for the assessment. However, differences were found between different methodologies for RVD assessment. While CT angiography allows assessment only of RV
dilatation, echocardiography also allows functional assessments and
estimate of pulmonary artery pressure. BNP and NT-proBNP offer
indirect estimate of functional overload.
In our study, RVD at echocardiography and BNP or NT-proBNP
levels were the most reliable predictors of death. Although the definition of RVD at echocardiography varied across studies-and probably across individual patients in each study-the association with
death was consistent across all the analyses and no heterogeneity
was shown. Similarly, we pooled BNP and NT-proBNP to avoid small
groups' effect and almost all the analyses revealed an association between these biomarkers and death with no evidence for heterogeneity. The non-significant association observed for CT-assessed RVD
and death might be due to less defined criteria for RVD at CT angiography as well as the limited number of patients included in the analysis
and their particularly low death rates. In fact, the prognostic value of
CT-assessed RVD is based on studies in the overall population of
patients with acute PE or in those haemodynamically stable. This is
the first study specifically assessing the prognostic role of CTassessed RVD in a large sample of patients with acute PE at low risk
for death. It should be considered that a good correlation has been
shown between CT and echo assessment of RVD.55,56 It is conceivable that the low mortality rates reported in the low-risk population
according to clinical models reduce the power of CT-assessed RVD.
The results on the predictive value of RVD at echocardiography
are reassuring. In fact, in our era of portable point-of-care ultrasound,
the feasibility of RVD assessment has much improved, also thanks to
the improved skill of physicians in emergency departments, critical
care, and intensive care units that are trained and familiar with the
use of this technology.57-59
PESI and sPESI have shown a high accuracy in identifying patients at
low risk for death. Limited data are currently available on comparison
between clinical scores or clinical gestalt for risk assessment in
patients with acute PE. By including assessment of vital parameters,
clinical scores represent a snapshot of the patient's situation in a specific time point that may completely change over time. It is coinceivable that RV assessment by echo or biomarkers is a more stable
parameter. In this view, PESI and sPESI should not be intended as substitutes for reasonable clinical judgement that is mandatory to make
any decision on patient management.
Sensitivity analyses showed no association between patients' features and short-term death. These results could be related to the

usual setting for identification of outcome predictors. Finally, timing
of assessment may impact on findings of RVD. Unfortunately, we do
not have timing of examinations in the individual patients.
Our study has also some strengths. By including >5000 patients,
ours is by far the largest study on risk assessment of patients with PE
at low risk for death based on clinical models. As in all IPDMAs, it
increases the precision of study results by increasing the sample size,
and enables the development of more robust subgroup analyses.61
Our IPDMA offered the possibility of standardizing the assessment of
low-risk groups by recalculating clinical models (PESI and sPESI) and
establishing uniform outcome definitions.
In conclusion, our study shows that echocardiography and cardiac
biomarkers can improve the selection of patients with acute PE at
low risk for death based on clinical models. RVD assessment, mainly
by BNP/NT-proBNP or echocardiography, should be considered to
improve identification of low-risk patients that may be candidates for
outpatient management or short hospital stay, thus reducing the burden on the health systems and harm to patients.
