A substantial number of chronic coronary syndrome (CCS) patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) experience
periprocedural myocardial injury or infarction. Accurate diagnosis of these PCI-related complications is required to guide further management given that their occurrence may be associated with increased risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE). Due to lack of scientific
data, the cut-off thresholds of post-PCI cardiac troponin (cTn) elevation used for defining periprocedural myocardial injury and infarction,
have been selected based on expert consensus opinions, and their prognostic relevance remains unclear. In this Consensus Document
from the ESC Working Group on Cellular Biology of the Heart and European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions
(EAPCI), we recommend, whenever possible, the measurement of baseline (pre-PCI) cTn and post-PCI cTn values in all CCS patients
undergoing PCI. We confirm the prognostic relevance of the post-PCI cTn elevation >5 99th percentile URL threshold used to define
type 4a myocardial infarction (MI). In the absence of periprocedural angiographic flow-limiting complications or electrocardiogram (ECG)
and imaging evidence of new myocardial ischaemia, we propose the same post-PCI cTn cut-off threshold (>5 99th percentile URL) be
used to define prognostically relevant 'major' periprocedural myocardial injury. As both type 4a MI and major periprocedural myocardial
injury are strong independent predictors of all-cause mortality at 1 year post-PCI, they may be used as quality metrics and surrogate endpoints for clinical trials. Further research is needed to evaluate treatment strategies for reducing the risk of major periprocedural myocardial injury, type 4a MI, and MACE in CCS patients undergoing PCI.

Introduction

Defining periprocedural
myocardial infarction and injury
A number of different diagnostic criteria have been proposed to define periprocedural MI (Table 1, Supplementary material online, Table
S1).6,7,16-20 Whereas the Universal Definition of Myocardial
Infarction (UDMI) task force has based the definition of type 4a MI on

Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) remains the major revascularization strategy for patients with obstructive coronary artery
disease (CAD), with an estimated 5 million procedures performed
worldwide each year.1 In a substantial number of PCI cases for acute
coronary syndrome (ACS) and chronic coronary syndrome (CCS),2
periprocedural myocardial injury or myocardial infarction (MI)
occurs,3 the actual incidences of which depend on the cardiac biomarker measured and the definitions used. Both these PCI-related
complications may be associated with an increased risk of future
major adverse cardiovascular events (such as death, re-infarction, and
revascularization).3,4 Due to lack of scientific data, the cut-off thresholds of post-PCI elevations of cardiac troponin (cTn) values used for
defining periprocedural myocardial injury and MI have been based on
expert consensus opinions.5-7 As such, evidence-based cut-off
thresholds of post-PCI cTn elevations for defining prognostically relevant periprocedural myocardial injury and MI need to be established.
This is particularly important given the use of periprocedural MI as
part of the primary composite endpoint in recent clinical trials of
CCS patients undergoing PCI.8-11 Furthermore, the choice of periprocedural MI definition has been shown to influence the outcomes
in recent clinical trials including ISCHEMIA,12,13 SYNTAXES,14 and
EXCEL.15
In this Consensus Document by the European Society of
Cardiology (ESC) Working Group on Cellular Biology of the Heart
and the European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular
Interventions (EAPCI), we review the latest scientific data evaluating
the prognostic relevance of post-PCI cTn elevations. We have
restricted our focus to CCS patients undergoing PCI with normal
baseline or elevated but stable baseline (pre-PCI) cTn values, although periprocedural myocardial injury and type 4a MI are of course
also relevant to ACS patients undergoing urgent PCI. The aims of our
Consensus Document are as follows: (i) establish the cut-off thresholds of post-PCI cTn elevations for defining prognostically relevant
periprocedural myocardial injury and type 4a MI; (ii) determine the
incidences of periprocedural myocardial injury and type 4a MI;
(iii) identify the patient features, lesion characteristics, and periprocedural factors, which independently predict future major adverse cardiac events (MACE); and (iv) provide recommendations for the
diagnosis of periprocedural myocardial injury or type 4a MI.

.. relatively low thresholds of cardiac biomarker elevations together

..

.. MI. More centres are changing from conventional cTn to high-sensi..
.. tivity cTn (hs-cTn) assays, and the latter have been used to define
.. periprocedural MI.6,7 As expected, the incidence of periprocedural
..
.. MI in CCS patients varies according to the definition and cardiac bio.. marker used. For type 4a MI (3rd UDMI), the incidence was 7% with

.. the definition and cardiac biomarker used from as low as 2.9%

are significantly better than conventional cTnI/T,30 and abundant

can be present in up to 30% of patients, due to comorbidities and risk

periprocedural myocardial injury and type 4a MI is not known, and
they are less sensitive than hs-cTnT/I and cMyC.39

o In summary, hs-cTn is the cardiac biomarker of choice for detecting periprocedural myocardial injury and type 4a MI in CCS
patients undergoing PCI.

Role of the ECG
Compared with a pre-procedural ECG, new ischaemic ECG changes
such as new ST-elevation at the J-point or new horizontal or downsloping ST-depression in two contiguous leads or new pathological Q
waves are one of the requirements to define type 4a MI according to
the 4th UDMI.7 It should be noted that isolated post-PCI development
of new pathological Q waves meets the type 4a MI criteria even if cTn
values are elevated and rising but <_5 99th percentile URL.7 The presence of pre-existing left bundle branch block (LBBB) makes the diagnosis of new ischaemic changes challenging. However, in patients with
LBBB, ST-elevation >_1 mm concordant with the QRS complex in any
lead may be an indicator of acute myocardial ischaemia.7

o In summary, new ischaemic ST-segment changes and/or pathological Q waves on ECG are one of the key criteria for defining
type 4a MI in CCS patients undergoing PCI.

Role of cardiac imaging
Transthoracic echocardiography is the most accessible and available
imaging modality for detecting new loss of viable myocardium or new
regional wall motion abnormality (RWMA) as one of the diagnostic
imaging criteria for defining type 4a MI. However, its comparative
lack of sensitivity makes it challenging to detect type 4a MI. Sensitivity
may be improved with use of contrast agents that enhance endocardial visualization,40 and with advanced echocardiography imaging
modalities, such as tissue Doppler imaging or speckle tracking, which
may detect more subtle RWMAs.41 Due to limitations in spatial
image resolution, it may be challenging to detect type 4a MI using
myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (SPECT or PET), unless the area of
irreversible myocardial injury is comparatively large. Although

.. contrast-enhanced computed tomography can detect irreversible
..
.. myocardial injury in ACS patients,42,43 its role in imaging type 4a MI
..
.. following PCI in CCS patients has not been tested.
..
Late gadolinium enhancement cardiovascular magnetic resonance
..
.. (LGE-CMR) is the gold-standard imaging technique for detection and

..

.. elevations of CK-MB48 and cTn.49 It occurs in two distinct pat..
.. terns47-51-new LGE immediately adjacent to the stent, due to
.. minor incidental side-branch occlusion (SBO), and new LGE distal to
..
.. the stent due to distal coronary embolization of atheromatous ma.. terial. New LGE on CMR is associated with a 3.1-fold increase in
..
.. MACE at a median follow-up of 2.9 years,45 although only modest
.. correlations have been shown with type 4a MI (according to 2nd
..
.. UDMI).44 Late gadolinium enhancement cardiovascular magnetic res.. onance imaging may, however, miss the occurrence of periproce..

periprocedural flow-limiting complications, such as coronary dissection, occlusion of a major epicardial artery, SBO/thrombus, disruption of collateral flow, or distal embolization. Academic Research
Consortium-26 has provided detailed criteria for defining flow-limiting coronary angiographic complications in PCI patients with suspected periprocedural MI. Interestingly, PCI complications detected
on angiography may not always be associated with cardiac biomarker
elevations, and minor elevations in cardiac biomarkers may occur
due to plaque disruption and local vessel injury without any obvious
coronary angiographic complications. Intravascular imaging modalities may be used to complement coronary angiography findings in
understanding the pathophysiology of PCI complications.

o In summary, periprocedural flow-limiting complications on coronary angiography are one of the key criteria for diagnosing type 4a
MI in CCS patients undergoing PCI.

Aetiology of periprocedural
myocardial injury and type 4a
myocardial infarction
The aetiology of periprocedural myocardial injury and type 4a MI is
multifactorial and may result from PCI-related events or complications, alone or in combination (Figure 1). The pathophysiology underlying periprocedural myocardial injury and type 4a MI is inherently
very different from type 1 MI. The former is related to the PCI procedure and occurs in the controlled setting of a catheter laboratory,
whereas the latter often occurs as an emergency outside the hospital
and is characterized by spontaneous coronary plaque rupture and
thrombosis and an associated systemic inflammatory response.7 Sidebranch occlusion is considered to be the most common cause of
type 4a MI in CCS patients undergoing PCI,53,54 but it is likely that its
impact on outcome depends on the size of the occluded side
branches. The incidence of SBO may be associated with the choice of
stent type, but also with the type of procedure [such as chronic total
occlusion (CTO), rotational atherectomy, etc.] and the target segment, with the mid-left anterior descending coronary artery having
the highest density of side branches.55-57 Irreversible myocardial injury due to SBO following PCI can be imaged by CMR as new LGE
adjacent to the stent (Role of cardiac imaging section).48-50 Distal
coronary embolization of intracoronary thrombus and atheromatous
material can result in no-reflow/slow-flow during PCI in CCS
patients. Embolization may not be preventable, despite current anticoagulant and antiplatelet adjunctive therapy and use of aspiration or
protection devices. Irreversible myocardial injury due to coronary
embolization following PCI can be imaged by CMR as new LGE
downstream of the stent (Role of cardiac imaging section).48-50
Thrombosis and neuro-hormonal activation may induce coronary
vasospasm during PCI in the epicardial arteries distal to the intervention site and may result in no-reflow/slow-reflow and periprocedural
myocardial injury.58 Moreover, coronary microcirculatory vasospasm
may arise as a consequence of potent vasoconstrictors, such as serotonin and endothelin, released from activated platelets and endothelium.59 A neural mechanism of vasoconstriction may also be involved,
as a-adrenoreceptor blockade has been shown to attenuate coronary vasoconstriction and increase coronary flow reserve during
PCI.60 Percutaneous coronary intervention-related factors, such as
pre-dilation, partially occlusive devices (such as catheter extension
devices, retrograde CTO procedures, atherectomy devices), which
are needed for optimal stent placement, can result in prolonged total
vessel occlusion times and induce periprocedural myocardial injury.
Abrupt vessel closure during PCI is usually caused by dissection proximal or distal to the stent or acute stent thrombosis. Other potential
rare periprocedural causes of myocardial injury include coronary artery wire perforation, air embolization, and arrhythmias. Even transient occlusions of the coronary artery during balloon angioplasty
inflations have been reported to increase cTn values during PCI in
CCS patients.61

o In summary, the aetiology of periprocedural myocardial injury and
type 4a MI is multifactorial, with SBO and distal embolization being
the major causes.

Independent predictors of major
adverse cardiac events following
percutaneous coronary
intervention
A variety of patient features, lesion characteristics, and periprocedural factors have been shown to be independent predictors of periprocedural myocardial injury, type 4a MI, and MACE, in CCS patients
undergoing PCI (Table 2, Supplementary material online, Table S2A
and B).3,23-28,34,35,62-68 Identification of these factors prior to the PCI
procedure may help to identify patients at higher risk of experiencing
these periprocedural complications and allow the implementation of
preventive measures (Table 3).69-88 Accordingly, these factors should
be adjusted for using multivariate logistic regression in studies evaluating the prognostic relevance of post-PCI elevations in cTn. Several
studies have shown elevated baseline (pre-PCI) cTn values (present
in up to 30% of patients), to be strong independent predictors of
MACE in CCS patients undergoing PCI.28,34,35,67 This likely reflects a

higher risk patient population in terms of patient risk factors, coronary plaque burden, and procedure complexity. Accordingly, studies
evaluating whether post-PCI cTn elevation is an independent predictor of MACE should either exclude patients with elevated baseline
cTn values or adjust for this factor.

Prognostic relevance of
periprocedural myocardial injury
and type 4a myocardial infarction
Although studies have demonstrated post-PCI elevations of either
CK-MB or cTn to be associated with future risk of MACE, cTn (and
hs-cTn) have replaced the use of CK-MB at most centres. A number
of clinical studies and meta-analyses, but not all, have reported associations between post-PCI elevation of cTn values and increased risk of
MACE (Supplementary material online, Tables 3A-D). Although several pooled meta-analyses have reported associations between postPCI elevations of cTn values and clinical outcomes, they did not adjust
for factors that are known to impact on the risk of periprocedural
myocardial injury, type 4a MI, and MACE4,89-91 (Supplementary material online, Table S3D). A recently published large patient-level
pooled analysis demonstrated that post-PCI elevations of both CKMB and cTn values were independently associated with all-cause

mortality at 1 year with the following combinations of fold elevations
being predictive of outcome: CK-MB >_5 and cTn >_35, CK-MB >_10
and cTn <70, and CK-MB >_5 and cTn >_7023 (Supplementary material
online, Table S3D). However, this study did not evaluate whether
post-PCI cTn elevation as a continuous variable was predictive of allcause mortality at 1 year.23 Silvain et al.62 have recently performed a
patient-level pooled analysis focused on post-PCI cTn elevations
(analysing a different set of studies to that by Garcia-Garcia et al.23)
comprising 9081 CCS patients undergoing PCI (Supplementary material online, Table S3d). In this study, care was taken to evaluate the
baseline (pre-PCI) cTn value to ensure that the appropriate 99th percentile URL for the assay was used, and if it was not, the study was
excluded. The incidence of type 4a MI in a subset of 2316 CCS
patients undergoing PCI with normal baseline cTn values was 12.7%,
and its occurrence was a strong independent predictor of all-cause
mortality at 1 year [adjusted odds ratio (AdjOR) 3.21, 95% confidence interval (1.42-7.27), P = 0.005]. These findings confirm the
prognostic relevance of the >5 99th percentile URL cut-off threshold of post-PCI cTn elevation selected by the 4th UDMI for defining
type 4a MI. The incidence of periprocedural myocardial injury
(defined as post-PCI cTn elevation >1 99th percentile URL by the
4th UDMI) in CCS patients with normal baseline cTn values was

52.8% (79.8% if the analysis was restricted to hs-cTn), but periprocedural myocardial injury was not associated with all-cause mortality at
1 year (Supplementary material online, Table S3D).62 These findings
suggest that the 4th UDMI definition of periprocedural myocardial injury might be too sensitive, as it is not an independent predictor of
all-cause mortality at 1 year. However, the study by Silvain et al.62 did
find that post-PCI cTn elevations >3 99th percentile URL independently predicted all-cause mortality at 1 year in CCS patients
undergoing PCI, suggesting that even relatively low post-PCI elevations of cTn are prognostically relevant (Supplementary material online, Table S3D). The analysis may have been underpowered to detect
the prognostic relevance of even smaller changes in cTn values.
Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis identified a post-PCI
cTn cut-off elevation of >5 99th percentile URL to be the optimum
threshold for independently predicting all-cause mortality at 1 year in
terms of sensitivity and specificity. Prognostically relevant or 'major'
periprocedural myocardial injury (defined in this Consensus
Document as a post-PCI cTn elevation of >5 99th percentile URL)
occurred in 18.2% of patients with normal baseline cTn values and
was an independent predictor of all-cause mortality at 1 year [AdjOR
2.29, 95% CI (1.32-3.97), P = 0.004]. Importantly, this post-PCI cTn
threshold is identical to that used in the 4th UDMI definition of type

Management of periprocedural
myocardial injury and type 4a
myocardial infarction
Current practice guidelines do not provide specific recommendations for diagnosing and managing periprocedural myocardial injury
or type 4a MI in CCS patients undergoing PCI.2,92 Based on a review
of current scientific data, and the results of a recent individual-level
pooled analysis,62 we propose a diagnostic algorithm for periprocedural myocardial injury and type 4a MI in CCS patients with normal
(pre-PCI) baseline cTn values undergoing PCI (Figure 3). For CCS
patients with baseline (pre-PCI) cTn values, which are elevated, stable, or falling, the post-PCI cTn must rise by >20%, and the absolute
post-PCI value must still be >5 99th percentile URL for both major
periprocedural myocardial injury and type 4a MI7 (Figure 3).

Before the percutaneous coronary
intervention procedure
Whether all CCS patients undergoing PCI should undergo routine
baseline (pre-PCI) and post-PCI measurements of cTn has been discussed in past guidelines. The ACC/AHA/SCAI 2005 guideline update
for PCI93 had originally made a class IIa recommendation for routine
measurement of cardiac biomarker levels (CK-MB and/or cTn) in all
patients undergoing PCI, and at 8-12 h after the procedure, but these
recommendations were not included in the ESC/EACTS 2018 guidelines on myocardial revascularization.92 In the 4th UDMI, it was recommended that baseline (pre-PCI) and post-PCI cTn values should
be routinely measured to detect the occurrence of periprocedural
myocardial injury.7 In order to make an accurate diagnosis of either
major periprocedural myocardial injury or type 4a MI following PCI,
prior knowledge of the baseline (pre-PCI) cTn level is required to
correctly interpret post-PCI elevations of cTn values.
In this Consensus Document, we recommend that, whenever possible, baseline (pre-PCI) cTn values should be measured in all CCS
patients undergoing PCI. For CCS patients undergoing a planned PCI
procedure, the blood sample may be undertaken in the cardiac catheterization laboratory from the arterial sheath prior to PCI, and for

.. those CCS patients undergoing initial diagnostic coronary angiog..
.. raphy, the blood sample may be taken via the arterial sheath from
.. only those patients proceeding to PCI. It is appreciated that in some
..
.. centres, routine measurement of baseline (pre-PCI) cTn values may
.. not be possible in all CCS patients undergoing PCI. In this case, one
..
.. may consider measurement of baseline (pre-PCI) cTn values in only
.. those with patient features, lesion characteristics, and periprocedural
..
.. factors that have been shown to independently predict major peri..
.. procedural myocardial injury, type 4a MI, and MACE following PCI
.. (see Table 2).
..
The 2017 ESC focused update on dual anti-platelet therapy
..
.. (DAPT) in CAD recommends clopidogrel (600 mg loading dose,
..
.. 75 mg daily dose) in addition to aspirin in CCS patients undergoing
.. planned PCI (IA recommendation).94 This is supported by recent
..
.. studies in CCS patients undergoing PCI reporting that pre-treatment
.. with the potent platelet P2Y12 inhibitors ticagrelor (pre-PCI and daily
..
.. for 30 days)95 or prasugrel (pre-PCI only),96 did not reduce peripro.. cedural myocardial injury or MI, with ticagrelor being associated with
..
.. an increased risk of minor bleeding at 30 days, when compared with
.. clopidogrel. For DAPT-naive CCS patients who require PCI following
..
.. diagnostic coronary angiography, it is probably advisable to delay PCI
.. by >2 h or even to the next day, given that a 600 mg loading dose of
..
.. clopidogrel acts in 2 h. However, in those rare instances where ad.. hoc PCI is urgently required in DAPT-naive CCS patients, oral loading
..
.. with soluble aspirin and ticagrelor or crushed prasugrel may be con.. sidered given their faster onset of action (30 min), with clopidogrel
..
.. given thereafter (600 mg loading dose, 75 mg daily dose). In cases of
.. urgent complex ad-hoc PCI in DAPT-naive CCS patients, one may
..
.. also consider intravenous fast-acting cangrelor to achieve rapid plate.. let inhibition at time of PCI, based on the results of the CHAMPION
..
.. PHOENIX trial.79
..
Several other therapeutic strategies have been evaluated for their
..
.. ability to prevent periprocedural myocardial injury and type 4a MI in
..
.. CCS patients when given prior to PCI (Table 3). Of these, there is
.. substantial evidence to show that high-dose statins (e.g. atorvastatin
..
.. 80 mg or rosuvastatin 40 mg) administered prior to PCI can reduce
.. the risk of periprocedural myocardial injury, type 4a MI, and MACE in
..
.. CCS patients.75 Low-dose treatment with the anti-inflammatory
.. agent, colchicine, has been reported to reduce mainly ischaemia..
.. driven clinical events in patients with recent MI97 and in CCS
.. patients.98 However, pre-treatment of CCS with high-dose colchi..
.. cine prior to PCI failed to reduce the incidence of periprocedural
.. myocardial injury (as defined by the 4th UDMI), type 4a MI, or SCAI..
.. defined periprocedural MI, when compared with placebo.99
.. Whether post-PCI treatment with low-dose colchicine can reduce
..
.. MACE in CCS patients experiencing type 4a MI post-PCI is not
.. known.

4a MI, simplifying the diagnosis of major periprocedural myocardial
injury and type 4a MI. As expected the prognostic implications of
type 4a MI are greater than major periprocedural myocardial injury
following PCI, with the risk of 1-year all-cause mortality being higher
in patients with type 4a MI (AdjOR 3.21) when compared with those
patients with major periprocedural myocardial injury (AdjOR 2.29).62
These findings confirm that the presence of new ischaemic changes
on ECG or angiographic evidence of a flow-limiting complication, as
required for type 4a MI, do provide additional prognostic information. In this Consensus Document, we define patients with post-PCI
cTn elevations >1 but <_5 99th percentile URL as having 'minor'
periprocedural myocardial injury.
Figure 2 provides a summary of the definitions, incidence, and impact on clinical outcomes of periprocedural myocardial injury as
defined by the 4th UDMI, major periprocedural myocardial injury,
and type 4a MI in CCS patients undergoing PCI.

identify and correct mechanical factors that might contribute to coronary dissection or stent thrombosis.92 Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors may be considered in specific 'bail-out' situations including high
intraprocedural thrombus burden, slow-flow, or no-flow with closure of the stented coronary vessel (ESC class IIa level C recommendation).92 In cases of vasospasm or no-reflow, the use of
intracoronary vasodilators, such as calcium channel blockers, nitroglycerine, nitroprusside, or adenosine, may be helpful, but there are
no data to recommend one drug over the other. Chronic coronary
syndrome patients with these periprocedural complications will of
course be at a greater risk of experiencing periprocedural myocardial
injury and type 4a MI and should have post-PCI cTn values measured
(Figure 3).

Figure 3 Diagnostic algorithm for periprocedural myocardial injury and type 4a myocardial infarction in chronic coronary syndrome patients
undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. In this Consensus Document, we propose a diagnostic algorithm for periprocedural myocardial injury and type 4a myocardial infarction in chronic coronary syndrome patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, which is based on
post-percutaneous coronary intervention elevation of cardiac troponin values, and the presence of ECG/imaging/angiographic evidence of new myocardial ischaemia as stipulated in the 4th Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction. Patients with suspected major periprocedural myocardial injury, based on post-percutaneous coronary intervention cardiac troponin elevation of >5 99th percentile URL, the ECG and coronary angiogram
should be carefully reviewed, and cardiac imaging (e.g. echocardiography) performed to actively exclude the diagnosis of type 4a myocardial infarction. The presence of either major periprocedural myocardial injury or type 4a myocardial infarction in chronic coronary syndrome patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention is prognostically relevant, as both have been shown to be independent predictors of mortality at 1 year
post-percutaneous coronary intervention. In patients with elevated baseline (pre-percutaneous coronary intervention) cardiac troponin in whom
the cardiac troponin values are stable (<_20% variation) or falling, the post-percutaneous coronary intervention cardiac troponin values must rise by
>20%. However, the absolute post-percutaneous coronary intervention value must still be >5 99th percentile URL to diagnose major periprocedural myocardial injury or type 4a myocardial infarction. CCS, chronic coronary syndrome; PCI, percutaneous coronary intervention; URL, upper reference limit.

to be evaluated in further studies.
Patients with no periprocedural myocardial injury (post-PCI cTn
elevation <_1 99th percentile URL) or only 'minor' periprocedural
myocardial injury (post-PCI cTn elevation >1 99th percentile URL

guidelines.2,92

Future research directions

PCI, and further research is needed to address this.

(pre-PCI) and post-PCI cTn levels in all CCS patients undergoing
PCI are justified because it may provide important registry data
and enable future research to confirm the prognostic relevance of
cTn levels on clinical outcomes, and inform future recommendations in terms of management strategies and new treatments in
CCS patients experiencing major periprocedural myocardial injury
and type 4a MI following PCI.
Further studies are needed to evaluate the prognostic relevance
of post-PCI elevations of hs-cTn in CCS patients undergoing PCI,
given that the majority of clinical studies have used conventional
cTn.
The optimal time-point(s) for measuring post-PCI cTn values to
predict future MACE is not known, and the choice of this timescale will need to recognize that in some centres, CCS patients
undergoing uncomplicated PCI are discharged on the same day.
Clinical studies are needed to validate the diagnostic criteria for
defining prognostically relevant major periprocedural myocardial
injury and type 4a MI in CCS patients with elevated baseline (prePCI) cTn values-this is currently defined in the 4th UDMI as a
>20% increase in post-PCI cTn.7
The focus of this Consensus Document has been on the prognostic relevance of periprocedural myocardial injury and type 4a MI in
CCS patients undergoing PCI. Further studies are needed to evaluate the prognostic relevance of post-PCI cTn elevations in ACS
patients, in whom baseline (pre-PCI) cTn values are elevated and
rising.
Further research is needed to discover novel treatments that can
be administered to CCS patients prior to PCI to reduce the risk
of periprocedural myocardial injury and type 4a MI. In this regard,
the incidence of major periprocedural myocardial injury and type
4a MI may serve as prognostically relevant surrogate clinical endpoints for assessing the efficacy of future cardioprotective
therapies.
Further studies are needed to evaluate new treatments for reducing the future risk of MACE, which can be administered following
PCI to patients who experience major periprocedural myocardial
injury or type 4a MI. In this regard, whether patients who are not
already on ACE-inhibitors (for heart failure, hypertension, or diabetes) or beta-blockers (for left ventricular dysfunction or systolic
heart failure), would benefit from the addition of these pharmacotherapies to reduce the risk of future MACE is not known and
remains to be tested.
Periprocedural MI has been used as a primary composite endpoint
in recent clinical trials of CCS patients undergoing PCI,12-15 and

periprocedural myocardial injury.7 Therefore, in this consensus document, we recommend that, whenever possible, all CCS patients
undergoing PCI, should have post-PCI cTn values measured at 3-6 h
post-PCI, and where cTn values are rising, further blood sampling
may be considered to document the peak cTn value at 12-24 h postprocedure (Figure 3).7,100 This is mandatory in those patients who experience periprocedural complications associated with reduced coronary blood flow or have ECG changes indicative of new myocardial
ischaemia, so that a diagnosis of type 4a MI can be made. For those
patients who are kept in overnight for observation by their treating
physician due to periprocedural complications, it may be feasible to
measure cTn values at 3-6 h with repeat testing at 12-24 h.
However, for those patients with uncomplicated PCI who may be
discharged on the same day, the measurement of post-PCI cTn values
may only be possible at the 3-6 h time-point. It is appreciated that in
some centres, routine measurement of post-PCI cTn values may not
be possible in all CCS patients undergoing PCI. In this case, one may
consider measurement of post-PCI cTn values in only those with patient features, lesion characteristics, and procedural factors, which
have been shown to be independent predictors of major periprocedural myocardial injury, type 4a MI, and MACE following PCI (see
Table 2).
Chronic coronary syndrome patients diagnosed with type 4a MI
following PCI, based on post-PCI cTn elevations of >5 99th percentile URL within 48 h, and evidence of new myocardial ischaemia
(ECG changes or angiography evidence of a flow-limiting complication) should undergo echocardiography or other cardiac imaging to
detect the presence of new loss of viable myocardium or new
RWMA and assess left ventricular ejection fraction. Chronic coronary syndrome patients diagnosed with type 4a MI are at increased
risk of all-cause 1 year of mortality (AdjOR 3.21),62 and pharmacotherapy should be optimized to reduce risk of future MACE, as recommended in current ESC revascularization and CCS guidelines.2,92
Whether CCS patients with type 4a MI, who are not already on
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (for heart failure,
hypertension, or diabetes) or beta-blockers (for left ventricular dysfunction or systolic heart failure), would benefit from the addition of
these pharmacotherapies to reduce the risk of future MACE is not
known, and needs to be evaluated in future studies.
In the absence of new myocardial ischaemia (new ischaemic
changes on ECG or angiographic evidence of a flow-limiting complication), a post-PCI cTn elevation of >5 99th percentile URL within
48 h post-procedure indicates the occurrence of prognostically relevant major periprocedural myocardial injury (Figure 3).62 In these
patients, a type 4a MI should be actively excluded by careful review
of the ECG (for new ischaemic changes) and coronary angiogram
(for any subtle periprocedural flow-limiting complication), and an
echocardiogram or other cardiac imaging should be performed to
exclude an RWMA and to assess left ventricular ejection fraction.7
Chronic coronary syndrome patients diagnosed with major periprocedural myocardial injury are at increased risk of 1 year of all-cause
mortality (AdjOR 2.29),62 and pharmacotherapy should be optimized
to reduce risk of future MACE, as recommended in ESC revascularization and CCS guidelines.2,92 Whether CCS patients with prognostically relevant major periprocedural myocardial injury, who are not

Consensus recommendations
o Baseline (pre-PCI) cTn values: Baseline (pre-PCI) cTn values should
be measured, whenever possible, in all CCS patients undergoing
PCI, as knowledge of this information is essential to correctly interpret post-PCI elevations in cTn values,28,34,35,67 and to diagnose
major periprocedural myocardial injury and type 4a MI following
PCI (Figure 3; Graphical abstract).
o Post-PCI cTn values: Post-PCI cTn values should be measured,
whenever possible, at 3-6 h post-procedure, and if the values are
rising, further sampling may be considered at 12-24 h post-procedure in all CCS patients undergoing PCI. For those with concurrent ECG, imaging or angiographic evidence of new myocardial
ischaemia, the diagnosis of type 4a MI may apply (Figure 3).7 For
those without concurrent ECG, imaging or angiographic evidence
of new myocardial ischaemia, the diagnosis of major periprocedural myocardial injury may apply (Figure 3).62
o Type 4a MI: In CCS patients with normal baseline (pre-PCI) cTn
values (<_1 99th percentile URL) or elevated but stable baseline
cTn values undergoing PCI who experience a type 4a MI, pharmacotherapy should be optimized to reduce risk of future MACE as
recommended in current ESC revascularization and CCS guidelines.2,92 Whether CCS patients with type 4a MI, who are not already on ACE-inhibitors (for heart failure, hypertension, or

for reducing the risk of future MACE is not known, and needs to

..
..
..
..
.. Summary
..
.. The prognostic relevance of post-PCI elevations in cardiac bio..
.. markers in CCS patients undergoing PCI has long been debated in
.. the literature, and due to lack of scientific data, the cut-off thresholds
..
.. of post-PCI cTn elevation used for defining periprocedural myocar.. dial injury and infarction, have been selected based on consensus ex..
.. pert opinions.5-7 With respect to type 4a MI in CCS patients with
.. normal baseline (pre-PCI) cTn or elevated but stable baseline cTn
..
.. values, published studies3,65 and a recent patient-level pooled ana.. lysis62 have validated the post-PCI cut-off threshold of cTn >5 99th
..
.. percentile URL, and have shown it to be a strong independent pre.. dictor of all-cause mortality at 1 year. The major issue has been with
..
... periprocedural myocardial injury, which has been defined by the 4th
.. UDMI, as any post-PCI elevation in cTn >1 99th percentile URL in
..
.. CCS patients with normal baseline (pre-PCI) cTn values. This cut-off
.. value for post-PCI cTn elevation might be too low given that up to
..
.. 80% (using hs-cTn) of patients experience periprocedural myocardial
.. injury according to this definition, and the fact that its occurrence
..
.. does not independently predict all-cause mortality at 1 year.62
.. However, a post-PCI elevation in cTn of >3 99th percentile URL
..
.. was found to be independently associated with an increased risk of
.. all-cause mortality at 1 year, suggesting that even relatively low levels
..
.. of post-PCI cTn elevation are prognostically relevant. It has been
.. reported that the optimum threshold for independently predicting
..
.. all-cause mortality at 1 year post-PCI in CCS patients with normal
.. baseline (pre-PCI) cTn values was >5 99th percentile URL.62
..
.. Therefore, in this Consensus Document, we have defined this cut-off
.. to signify the occurrence of prognostically relevant major periproce..
.. dural myocardial injury. Importantly, this cut-off threshold is identical
.. to that used to define type 4a MI, thereby simplifying the diagnoses of

the choice of periprocedural MI definition (protocol-specific vs.
type 4a MI vs. SCAI) has been shown to impact on the outcomes
of these trials.12-15,101 As such, further research is needed to better define periprocedural MI when used as a primary composite
endpoint in clinical trials. We would recommend that the type 4a
MI definition is used in this situation, given its known prognostic
impact on mortality.3,62 Whether modest isolated post-PCI elevations of cTn >5 99th percentile URL (indicative of periprocedural major myocardial injury) should be used as a primary
composite endpoint as well needs to be evaluated in future research studies.101
o The digital innovation in healthcare has increased the quantity and
quality of patient-generated health data. Machine learning algorithms have been used to enhance risk prediction of post-PCI
acute kidney injury,102 bleeding,103,104 and clinical outcomes,105
thereby improving clinical decision-making before and during PCI
in CCS patients. Whether they can also be used to improve risk
prediction of post-PCI complications such as periprocedural myocardial injury and type 4a MI is not known, and warrants further
investigation.

major periprocedural myocardial injury and type 4a MI. In this
Consensus Document, we present a diagnostic algorithm for minor
and major periprocedural myocardial injury and type 4a MI in CCS
patients undergoing PCI, based on post-PCI cTn values and ECG/
imaging/angiographic evidence of new myocardial ischaemia
(Figure 3). Further research is needed to evaluate novel treatments
for reducing the risk of type 4a MI and major periprocedural myocardial injury in CCS patients undergoing PCI, and further studies are
needed to evaluate pharmacotherapies for reducing the risk of future
MACE in those CCS patients who experience these PCI-related
complications.
