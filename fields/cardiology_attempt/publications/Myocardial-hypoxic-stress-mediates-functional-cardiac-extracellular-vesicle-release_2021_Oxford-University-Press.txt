Aims

Increased shedding of extracellular vesicles (EVs)-small, lipid bilayer-delimited particles with a role in paracrine signalling-
has been associated with human pathologies, e.g. atherosclerosis, but whether this is true for cardiac diseases is unknown.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
Here, we used the surface antigen CD172a as a specific marker of cardiomyocyte (CM)-derived EVs; the CM origin of
and results
CD172ath EVs was supported by their content of cardiac-specific proteins and heart-enriched microRNAs. We found
that patients with aortic stenosis, ischaemic heart disease, or cardiomyopathy had higher circulating CD172ath cardiac EV
counts than did healthy subjects. Cellular stress was a major determinant of EV release from CMs, with hypoxia increasing
shedding in in vitro and in vivo experiments. At the functional level, EVs isolated from the supernatant of CMs derived from
human-induced pluripotent stem cells and cultured in a hypoxic atmosphere elicited a positive inotropic response in unstressed CMs, an effect we found to be dependent on an increase in the number of EVs expressing ceramide on their surface. Of potential clinical relevance, aortic stenosis patients with the highest counts of circulating cardiac CD172ath EVs
had a more favourable prognosis for transcatheter aortic valve replacement than those with lower counts.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
We identified circulating CD172ath EVs as cardiac derived, showing their release and function and providing evidence for their prognostic potential in aortic stenosis patients.

Translational Perspective
Developing improved approaches for the prognosis of cardiovascular pathologies is a continuing challenge. We identified CD172ath
extracellular vesicles (EVs) as of myocardial origin and found that when under hypoxic stress, cardiomyocytes (CMs) shed more EVs,
promoting a positive inotropic response in unstressed CMs. At a clinical level, aortic stenosis patients with a higher level of circulating
cardiac-derived CD172ath EVs had better survival than those with a lower one when undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement.
In conclusion, circulating cardiac-derived CD172ath EVs are a promising prognostic biomarker for myocardial diseases.

Introduction
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are lipid bilayer-delimited, nonreplicating
particles released from different subcellular compartments.1 They
can be classified on the basis of a physical characteristic, such density
or size-for example small EVs denoting particles <100-200 nm and
medium/large EVs denoting those >200 nm-or the cell/condition of
origin-for example, platelet EVs, hypoxic EVs, or apoptotic bodies
(ABs).1 Moreover, because EVs originate from various cell types,2,3
they acquire specific antigens expressed by the cell of origin, in addition to negatively charged phospholipids and membrane-associated
glycoproteins, mainly phosphatidylserine (PS) and lactadherin.1,4-7
Therefore, they can also be classified on the basis of their biochemical
composition.1
EVs play a role in the intercellular communication pathways occurring among cells of the same as well as of different cell types. EVs, together with proteins, peptides, lipids, and noncoding RNAs, are part
of the cellular secretome. Once released, EVs influence the surrounding environment through their cargo of active biomolecules,
such as proteins,8,9 mRNAs,10,11 microRNAs (miRNAs),11,12 and lipids.9,13 In particular, a role for sphingolipids in EV biogenesis, release,
and activity has been identified.13-16 Of note, two sphingolipids,
ceramides (Cer) and sphingosine-1-phosphate, act as signalling molecules that modify processes such as cell activation,17-20 growth,21,22
and death.23

EV shedding has been reported to increase upon inflammation,
hypoxia, and mechanical stress.24-26 EVs have been described as
interesting new biomarkers in various disease settings, including inflammatory diseases, metabolic syndrome, cancer, and cardiovascular
diseases (CVDs).27-31 Indeed, in atherosclerosis, EVs have been
reported to accumulate in plaques and affect biological pathways
such as inflammation, proliferation, thrombosis, calcification, and
vasoactive responses26,32,33; increased circulating levels of EVs originating from different cell types have been suggested to have potential
diagnostic and/or prognostic value in various CVDs.33-42 However,
their identification, characterization, and quantification is challenging
on account of their diversity. Thus, a specific analysis of cardiacderived EVs as biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of heart
diseases is hindered by the absence or non-selectivity of cardiomyocyte (CM)-specific surface antigens.
Signal-regulatory protein alpha (SIRPa; CD172a)-which is
expressed by subsets of leukocytes (i.e. monocytes and lymphocytes)43-has recently been reported to be also a unique surface
marker identifying progenitors of the CM lineage differentiated from
human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs).44 We therefore
sought to set up a method for the identification of CM EVs based on
the surface expression of SIRPa. Using this method, we demonstrate
here that hypoxia elicits increased shedding of CD172ath EVs from
CMs in vitro and in vivo. Of note, CD172ath EVs released under hypoxic conditions were functionally linked to a positive inotropic response

in unstressed CMs, an effect we ascribe to an enrichment of Cer-
sphingolipids that increase during hypoxia45-on the surface of these
EVs (see Graphical Abstract). Of potential clinical importance, we provide evidence that the assessment of circulating cardiac CD172ath
EVs can be used for the prognosis of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in patients with aortic stenosis, an age-associated
disease secondary to aortic sclerosis that induces myocardial hypertrophy and stress.

Detection of CM-derived EVs in human
plasma
Since human plasma contains a wide repertoire of circulating tissuederived EVs, we adapted the above method for the detection of EVs
released specifically by CMs into the bloodstream. We thus used a
multicolour flow cytometry-based method with a back-gating strategy (Figure 2A), in which we first excluded cell fragments (R2), ABs
(R3), erythroid-derived EVs (CD235ath events; R5), endotheliumand platelet-derived EVs (CD144th and CD61th events, respectively;
R7 and R8), and leucocyte/lymphocyte- and monocyte-derived EVs
(CD45/CD3th and CD14th events, respectively; R10 and R11); then,
CM-derived EVs were positively selected for on the basis of surface
expression of CD172a (R13). Of note, CD172a expression was strategically placed as the last parameter, enabling us to accurately discriminate cardiac-derived CD172ath EVs from those possibly shed by
other cell types: indeed, as indicated by a 6x6 antibody matrix

..
.. (Supplementary material online, Figure S7), the antibodies used in the
.. flow cytometry panel had high specificity, with only low numbers of
..
.. erythroid-, endothelium-, platelet-, leucocyte-, and monocyte.. derived EVs expressing CD172a.
..
Advanced hopping probe scanning ion conductance microscopy
..
.. was performed to study freshly isolated and sorted EVs to an ex..
.. tremely high spatial resolution (50-100 nm) and allow us to measure
.. the real EV volume in mm3. We found no significant differences in vol..
.. ume between CD172ath EVs and the other phenotyped EV fractions
.. (Supplementary material online, Figure S8).
..
..
The vesicular origin of CD172ath events was supported by con.. firming the high expression of flotillin 1 and caveolin 1-both mem..
.. brane-binding cytoplasmic proteins-and the virtual absence of any
..
.. specific antibody interaction with albumin, a possible co-isolated,
.. non-EV element (Supplementary material online, Figure S9A). As
..
.. expected, there was heterogeneous expression of PS, assessed
.. through indirect staining for the PS-binding protein annexin V
..
.. (Supplementary material online, Figure S9A). Moreover, a strong re.. duction in CD172ath events upon Triton X-100-produced mem..
.. brane lysis lent further support to them being derived bioactively
.. from the cell membrane (Supplementary material online, Figure S9B).
..
..
To confirm the cardiac origin of CD172ath EVs obtained from
.. human plasma, their internal content was assessed for the presence
..
.. of cTnT as well as miR-1 and miR-133a, two of the most highly
..
.. expressed miRNAs in the myocardium that are also tissue selective.
.. In the EVs harvested from three analysed patients, we found that
..
.. over 70% of CD172ath EVs were cTnTth, as opposed to only 4% of
.. CD61th EVs (internal negative control) (Figure 2B); however, we
..
.. could not exclude that cTnT- CD172ath EVs were also released from
.. the heart. In addition, CD172ath EVs expressed the two cardiac..
.. enriched miRNAs miR-1 and miR-133a (absolute quantification of
.. miR-1 and miR-133a in sorted CD172ath EVs given in Supplementary
..
.. material online, Figure S10), whereas CD14th EVs (internal negative
.. control) did not, though they still expressed the ubiquitous miRNA
..
.. miR-21 (Figure 2C). Because miRNA analysis was performed upon the
..
.. sorting of only up to 1000 plasma-derived CD172ath or CD14th EVs,
.. the low levels of miRNAs found could be ascribed to the low num..
.. bers of sorted EVs analysed.
..
To obtain further, albeit indirect, evidence of the cardiac origin of
..
.. EVs, we then determined the CD172ath EV count in blood samples
.. taken from the coronary sinus (CS) and the aortic arch (AA), other
..
.. than from the peripheral circulation, of four aortic stenosis (AS)
.. patients. Cardiac CD172ath EV count dropped significantly from the
..
.. CS to the AA and the periphery, lending further support to the no.. tion that the production and release of these EVs occurred in the
..
.. myocardium (Figure 2D).

myocardium (Supplementary material online, Figure S3B), we proceeded with a flow cytometry approach to analyse EVs shed by
hiPSC-CMs into the culture medium (see Supplementary material
online, Table S1 for a list of antibodies and probes used in the study).
To this end, we first isolated EVs by centrifugation and then performed flow cytometry for the identification and characterization of
CD172ath EVs (Figure 1A). Specificity of the antibody targeting
CD172a was confirmed using isotype control (Supplementary material online, Figure S4).
Of note, CD172ath EVs were characterized by a high internal content of the cardiac-specific protein troponin T (cTnT) and sarcomeric
actinin. The presence of CD172a on hiPSC-CM EVs was corroborated with a flow cytometry technology integrated with image analysis (Amnis Image Stream MK II), which allows clear distinction of
single annexin Vth/- CD172ath EVs from free antibodies and particle
aggregates (Figure 1B). Moreover, phenotypization of hiPSC-CM EVs
through western blot analysis for luminal and surface vesicular antigens (namely, CD63, CD9, Alix, TSG101, and AGO2) supported a
vesicular origin for our samples (Supplementary material online,
Figure S5).
We then morphologically characterized EV-like particles, AB-like
particles, and membrane fragments by comparing them to
Megamix Plus FSC beads.46 As expected, EVs mainly ranged in size
from 0.1 to 0.5 lm, whereas ABs and membrane fragments were
larger (Supplementary material online, Figure S6A). Size of the EVlike particles was confirmed through Nanosight analysis, which
revealed peaks at 135, 250, and 400, suggestive of a heterogeneous
EV population (Supplementary material online, Figure S6B). We
then verified the morphology and integrity of isolated EVs through
cryo-electron microscopy analysis. Most vesicles were intact and
had a round shape (Supplementary material online, Figure S6C).
More in detail, single-, double-, and multi-layer vesicles, doublemembrane vesicles, and vesicles with electron-dense cargo in the
lumen were visualized in samples of hiPSC-CM EVs, confirming the
presence of a heterogeneous EV population. Immuno-gold transmission electron microscopy analysis also revealed a high EV heterogeneity, with no differences in size observed between
CD172ath EVs and CD172a- EVs (Supplementary material online,
Figure S6D).

Hypoxia induces cardiac CD172ath EV
shedding
In an effort to determine the mechanism of CD172ath EV shedding by
CMs, we performed in vitro experiments in which hiPSC-CMs were cultured for 24 h under either a normoxic (20% O2) or a hypoxic (3% O2)
atmosphere before supernatants being collected for flow cytometry.
Shedding was increased significantly after 1 day of hypoxia (Figure 4A)
and remained constantly high for at least four days (Supplementary material online, Figure S12). Of note, when hypoxic cells were cultured for
a subsequent 24 h period under normoxia, the count of cardiac
CD172ath EVs decreased significantly, reaching a value comparable with
that of the pre-hypoxic condition (Figure 4A). Quantitative polymerase
chain reaction and western blot analyses for CD172a on hiPSC-CMs
conducted after 6 and 24 h of hypoxia revealed that CD172a mRNA
and protein were decreased in the presence of hypoxia (Supplementary
material online, Figure S13), a finding indicative of low oxygen having a
role in inducing cardiac CD172ath EV release but not in stimulating
CD172a neosynthesis.
To determine if findings held true also in vivo, we utilized a porcine
model of percutaneous transverse aortic constriction (pTAC), in
which maladaptive cardiac hypertrophy-and, hence, a hypoxic myocardial milieu-is induced via reduction of the aortic lumen, increasing systolic blood pressure to an average of 40 mmHg over the first
8 weeks.47 Fifty-six days after pTAC, the count of circulating
CD172ath EVs in pigs was significantly increased vs. pre-intervention
(Figure 4B).
This result led us to study cardiac CD172ath EVs in human heart
disease. To this end, we studied 109 patients obtained from a larger
cohort of AS patients enrolled at University Hospital SchleswigHolstein, Campus Kiel, Germany. AS causes pressure overloadinduced hypertrophy and a stressed myocardium and eventually leads
to the development of heart failure; when not treated with drugs, severe AS is clinically managed with either surgical aortic valve replacement or the minimally invasive TAVR procedure. We found that
cardiac CD172ath EV count was significantly reduced one-year postTAVR (Figure 4C). Data from another group of eight AS patients

The HD cohort had absolute counts of circulating total EVs (R5 th
R7 th R8 th R10 th R11 th R13) and cardiac CD172ath EVs of
4456 +/- 681 and 4.06 +/- 3.5/mL, respectively, the latter showing no significant age- or gender-related differences (Supplementary material
online, Figure S11). In all CVD cohorts, cardiac CD172ath EV count
was significantly increased vs. HDs (Figure 3). Moreover, within all
CVD patient groups, the relationships between potential confounders and cardiac CD172ath EV counts were small in absolute value
(Spearman correlation coefficient) and not significantly different from
zero (Supplementary material online, Table S8), with the exception of
diastolic blood pressure in the large AS cohort (n = 312; P = 0.004),
which nonetheless still had only poor correlation (Spearman, r =
-0.16). Thus, shedding of cardiac CD172ath EVs from the myocardium seems to be increased under conditions of pathologic stress.

performed a dose-response assay to test the effect of different
mCM-to-hypoxia-derived cardiac CD172ath EV ratios (1:2; 1:5, and
1:10). A significantly positive inotropic effect was elicited at the highest mCM-to-CD172ath EV ratio, a finding suggesting that we had performed our experiments with the minimum effective dose for cardiac
CD172ath EVs (Supplementary material online, Figure S15).
To assess whether EVs from non-cardiac cells could similarly elicit
a positive inotropic effect, we incubated mCMs for 20 min with total
non-cardiac EVs (ratio, 1 mCM:10 CD172ath EVs) harvested from
the supernatant of peripheral blood mononuclear cells cultured
under either normoxic or hypoxic conditions. Neither the normoxianor the hypoxia-derived non-cardiac EVs evoked any modification of
cell shortening (Supplementary material online, Figure S16), a result
coherent with the notion of an inotropic function being specific for
EVs released from the heart.
We then assessed whether cardiac CD172ath EVs sorted from AS
patients produced a similar effect on mCMs as those from hiPSC-CM
cultures. As expected, cardiac CD172ath EVs harvested from a pool
of AS patients induced a significant increase in cell shortening
(Figure 5B), even at the reduced mCM-to-CD172ath EV ratio (1:4).
This finding was strongly indicative of positive inotropic factor(s)
being enriched in the circulating cardiac CD172ath EVs of AS patients.

Ceramide mediates the effect of stressevoked cardiac CD172ath EVs
Reports of selective enrichment of Cer in EVs determined through
lipidomic analysis9 and of a time-dependent effect of Cer exposure
on ventricular CM inotropism20 prompted us to hypothesize a role
for this lipid in the biological activity of cardiac CD172ath EVs
released under hypoxic conditions. In support of this hypothesis, we
found a significantly higher level of Cer (monomeric or self-clusterized) in cardiac CD172ath EVs harvested from the supernatant of
iPSC-CMs cultured in hypoxic vs. normoxic conditions (Figure 6A).

..
.. This finding was corroborated in vivo since we observed a significant.. ly higher level of Cer (monomeric and self-clusterized) in circulating
..
.. cardiac CD172ath EVs from pre-TAVR AS patients vs. HDs
.. (Figure 6B). Of note, there was significantly greater Cer cluster for..
.. mation in cardiac CD172ath EVs from AS patients vs. hypoxia.. treated hiPSC-CMs (%, mean +/- SD: aggregates, 59.4 +/- 16.5 and
..
.. 34.0 +/- 6.8, respectively, P = 0.006; monomers, 60.2 +/- 17.5 and
.. 56.5 +/- 3.3, respectively, P = 0.36). This finding might explain why the
..
.. lower CM-to-EV ratio used for cell shortening experiments with the
.. former (Figure 5) was sufficient to evoke a positive inotropic effect.
..
..
To assess whether EV-carried Cer had a direct role in promoting CM
..
shortening,
we exposed hiPSC-CMs to zoleodronic acid (ZA)-which
..
... inhibits acid sphingomyelinase, an enzyme that catalyses the conversion
.. of sphingomyelin to Cer49-and then cultured the cells under hypoxia
..
.. before harvesting EVs. First, we verified whether ZA might influence EV
.. release through the induction of apoptosis, by assessing the frequency of
..
.. annexin V-positive cells. Because there was no difference in annexin V
.. positivity between hypoxia-cultured hiPSC-CMs exposed or not to ZA
..
.. (%, mean +/- SD: 17.6 +/- 2.9 and 19.6 +/- 0.9, respectively. P = 0.25, n = 4),
.. we concluded that ZA did not promote apoptosis-mediated EV release.
..
.. Of note, ZA led to a partial depletion of Cer on cardiac CD172ath EVs
.. (by ffi18% for Cer monomers and ffi35% for self-clusterized aggregates
..
.. after 24 h), whereas no Cer depletion was observed on cardiac
.. CD172a- EVs (Figure 6C and Supplementary material online, Figure S17).
..
.. When we assessed the inotropic effect of Cer-depleted EVs (obtained
.. from ZA-exposed hypoxic hiPSC-CM cultures), we found a significant
..
.. decrease in mCM shortening vs. mCMs cultured in the presence of Cer.. enriched EVs (obtained from hypoxic cultures not exposed to ZA)
..
.. (Figure 6D). This result suggested that the co-expression of CD172a and
.. Cer is important for the inotropic function of cardiac EVs.
..
..
Finally, since there is evidence for a direct role of Cer in promoting
..
intracellular
Ca2th transients by increasing Ca2th release from the
..
.. sarcoplasmic reticulum and Ca2th re-uptake in CMs,20,50 we asked
..
.. whether the enhanced CM contraction mediated by Cer-enriched
.. EVs could be ascribed to Ca2th release mechanisms. Of note, mCMs
..
.. showed significantly increased intracellular Ca2th transients upon
.. acute exposure to hypoxia-released cardiac EVs (Supplementary ma..
.. terial online, Figure S18), a finding confirming the previous reports on
.. Cer-mediated calcium activation on the sarcoplasmic reticulum.
..
Altogether, these findings suggest that hypoxia-released cardiac
..
.. CD172ath EVs exert a positive inotropic effect on CMs through a

cardiac CD172ath EV counts in patients vs. HDs (Figure 7A). We then
assessed by receiver operating characteristic analysis the capacity of
cardiac CD172ath EVs to discriminate between pathologic and
healthy subjects (Figure 7B). To evaluate any prognostic significance
of circulating cardiac CD172ath EVs, we analysed survival data of the
cohort one year post-TAVR, dichotomizing the pre-TAVR cardiac
CD172ath EV count with respect to the upper quartile (Figure 8A and
Supplementary material online, Figure S19). Of note, an elevated preTAVR cardiac CD172ath EV count was positively associated with
post-TAVR survival (hazard ratio 0.27; 95% confidence interval 0.12-
0.56; P < 0.001). Drug therapy was not associated with CD172ath EV
shedding (Supplementary material online, Table S10, all P-values
>0.06), but treatment with beta-blockers/non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers was associated with longer survival in the first
year (P = 0.001; P > 0.1 for all other drug classes).
As expected, high-sensitivity troponin T (hsTnT)51 and N-terminal
prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP)52 also had significant prognostic value; however, conversely to the cardiac CD172ath

EV count, both those biomarkers were higher in patients with poor
prognosis (Figure 8B and C). Of note, an elevated cardiac CD172ath EV
count was associated with a more favourable prognosis even in the
presence of elevated hsTnT or NT-proBNP. A multiple Cox model
revealed that elevated cardiac CD172ath EVs remained independently
associated with better survival after one year (Supplementary material
online, Table S11). These findings indicated that AS patients with higher
pre-procedural circulating cardiac CD172ath EV counts had a more favourable prognosis than those with lower ones.

Discussion
EVs are receiving increased interest as biomarkers for several multifactorial pathologies.27-31 As shown in the flow chart of our study design (Supplementary material online, Figure S1), we used the
membrane antigen SIRPa/CD172a44 to isolate CM-specific EVs, demonstrating the presence in them of cardiac-specific and/or -enriched

.. response in vitro, our data do not clarify in the intact animal whether
.. cardiac CD172ath EVs transduce signals to nearby cells or to distant
..
.. tissues, or at which concentration they might do so. Nonetheless, the
.. phenomenon we see is suggestive of a paracrine effect, and it is
..
.. tempting to speculate that the release of cardiac CD172ath EVs from
.. hypoxic portions of the myocardium increases inotropism in non-is..
.. chaemic areas of the heart as part of a compensatory mechanism
.. aimed at overcoming the decreased functionality of the negatively
..
.. affected district.
..
Finally, we give evidence that the level of cardiac CD172ath EV
..
.. shedding could represent a good prognostic index: indeed, AS
..
.. patients with a more elevated cardiac CD172ath EV count before
.. TAVR had better prognosis vs. those with a lower one. In TAVR
..
.. patients, we and others have found that adverse outcome can be pre.. dicted by several biomarkers, including hsTnT,51 NT-proBNP,52 and
..
.. growth differentiation factor 15.62 Here, we confirm the relevance of
.. the two most commonly used circulating biomarkers, NT-pro-BNP
..
... and hsTnT, both of which had independent prognostic value. Of
.. note, in the context of TAVR, all biomarkers except cardiac
.. CD172ath EVs predicted adverse outcome when upregulated. The
..
.. best scenario was represented by high cardiac CD172ath EV count
.. plus low hsTnT, whereas the worst was represented by low cardiac
..
.. CD172ath EVs plus high hsTNT. In addition to CD172ath EVs, it
.. would be reasonable to speculate that the levels of other circulating
..
.. EVs might also represent good prognostic indices for AS.
..
In light of these findings, cardiac CD172ath EVs could represent a
..
.. new class of biomarker for myocardial diseases. Further study of
..
.. these circulating cardiac-derived EVs could improve our understand.. ing of cardiovascular pathophysiology, disease staging, and respon..

molecules (i.e. cTnT, miR-1, and miR-133a). We also show that the
shedding of cardiac CD172ath EVs increases in ischaemic, mainly nonnecrotic, stress conditions since we found higher counts in the
plasma of patients with myocardial diseases characterized by subendocardial hypoxia, namely hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, stable ischaemic heart disease, and AS. This indicates that myocardium sheds
CD172ath EVs actively and to a greater extent when stressed than
when under basal conditions. It should be noted that our data do not
exclude the occurrence of active release of CD172a- cardiac EVs.
It has already been reported that cells injured by hypoxia release
EVs.53,54 In the present study, we used in vitro and in vivo experimental
models to confirm the hypothesis that hypoxia is a player also in the
shedding of CD172ath EVs from CMs: indeed, in hiPSC-derived CMs
cultured under a hypoxic atmosphere, as well as in pigs subjected to
transverse aortic constriction, the shedding of cardiac CD172ath EVs
was increased; this phenomenon decreased to a baseline level in
hiPSC-CMs upon restoring cultures to normoxia. Coherently, also
two different cohorts of AS patients presented with decreased circulating cardiac CD172ath EVs after TAVR.
The functional relevance of EVs in hypoxic diseases is controversial: there is evidence of adverse effects of EVs, mainly due to pro-oxidative and pro-apoptotic activities on different cell types, including
CMs,55-57 but some studies have reported a protective effect against
CM apoptosis.58,59 Our findings suggest the existence of a hitherto
unknown response evoked by cardiac EVs: positive inotropy. In our
effort to understand the mechanism of cardiac CD172ath EV-induced
enhancement of inotropy, we found that Cer-which are known to
possess positive inotropic properties45 and which have recently been
reported to be increased in total circulating EVs after myocardial ischaemia60-were enriched on CD172ath EVs from hypoxic CM cultures and AS patients. It has already been shown that EVs shed from
hypoxia-injured cells can transfer to adjacent normal cells a cargo
that is qualitatively different from that released by normoxic cells.61
In the present study, we demonstrate a direct link between increased
Cer expression in CD172ath EVs shed from hypoxic CMs and the enhancement of inotropy in normoxic cells via the amplification of intracellular calcium transients. Of note, mCM contraction was not
modulated by CD172ath EVs with a low Cer content-a condition
observed in normoxia-released EVs-a finding suggestive of the presence of CD172a not being sufficient to alter the inotropic state of the
CMs. Moreover, since non-cardiac CD172ath EVs did not alter CM
inotropy when shed after hypoxia, we cannot formally exclude that
other molecules carried specifically by cardiac CD172ath EVs might
support the positive inotropic effect we ascribe to Cer in the in vitro
experiments or might have other cardioprotective functions.
In the current study, we did not address the turnover rate of cardiac CD172ath EVs, their half-life, or the mechanism of clearance
(whether through glomerular filtration or by the liver). Moreover,
the low amounts of cardiac CD172th EVs obtainable limited the number of replicates of some in vitro experiments, and also did not permit
us to characterize in vivo the lipid and protein profiles, so we cannot
completely exclude that CD172th events were solely cardiac in origin, even if the gating strategy used was devised to decrease this possibility to the utmost. In addition, although we demonstrate that
hypoxia-released EVs have the potential to evoke a positive inotropic
