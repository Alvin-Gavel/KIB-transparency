Aims

While greater physical activity (PA) is associated with improved health outcomes, the direct links between distinct
components of PA, their changes over time, and cardiorespiratory fitness are incompletely understood.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
Maximum effort cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) and objective PA measures [sedentary time (SED),
steps/day, and moderate-vigorous PA (MVPA)] via accelerometers worn for 1 week concurrent with CPET and
and results
7.8 years prior were obtained in 2070 Framingham Heart Study participants [age 54 +/- 9 years, 51% women, SED
810 +/- 83 min/day, steps/day 7737 +/- 3520, MVPA 22.3 +/- 20.3 min/day, peak oxygen uptake (VO2) 23.6 +/- 6.9 mL/kg/
min]. Adjusted for clinical risk factors, increases in steps/day and MVPA and reduced SED between the two assessments were associated with distinct aspects of cardiorespiratory fitness (measured by VO2) during initiation, earlymoderate level, peak exercise, and recovery, with the highest effect estimates for MVPA (false discovery rate <5%
for all). Findings were largely consistent across categories of age, sex, obesity, and cardiovascular risk. Increases of
17 min of MVPA/day [95% confidence interval (CI) 14-21] or 4312 steps/day (95% CI 3439-5781; 54 min at 80
steps/min), or reductions of 249 min of SED per day (95% CI 149-777) between the two exam cycles corresponded to a 5% (1.2 mL/kg/min) higher peak VO2. Individuals with high (above-mean) steps or MVPA demonstrated above average peak VO2 values regardless of whether they had high or low SED.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusions
Our findings provide a detailed assessment of relations of different types of PA with multidimensional cardio-

respiratory fitness measures and suggest favourable longitudinal changes in PA (and MVPA in particular) are associated with greater objective fitness.

Introduction
Greater routine physical activity (PA) is associated with lower cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk1-6 and improved longevity.7-13 PA promotes cardiovascular health partly through positive effects on clinical
CVD risk factors (e.g. weight, blood pressure, dysglycemia, and blood
cholesterol14,15). However, the physiological and metabolic benefits
of PA extend beyond its impact on standard risk factors16,17 with favourable effects on multiple organ systems including the heart and
vasculature, brain, muscle, bones, and kidneys.18-21
The 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans encourage
several types of PA, including dedicated exercise [i.e. moderatevigorous PA (MVPA)], lower-level activity (e.g. steps during routine
ambulation), and minimization of sedentary time (SED), in accordance with growing evidence that each form of PA is associated with
improved long-term health outcomes.1-13,22 However, for individuals
across the age, sex, and cardiovascular risk status spectrum, the relative impact of PA intensity and duration on physical fitness remains
unclear. Cardiorespiratory fitness, as assessed by peak oxygen uptake
(VO2) during cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), integrates
global physiological function and is, therefore, ideally suited to investigate the relations of PA and metabolic health. CPET also provides

.. measures of central cardiac and vascular function and VO kinetics
2
..
.. during different phases of exercise (including initiation, low-moderate
.. intensity, peak exercise, and recovery), which may help to map how
..
.. each component of habitual PA relates to changes in metabolic
..
.. responses to exercise.
..
In the present investigation, we related different types of PA with
..
.. components of cardiorespiratory fitness in 2070 predominantly
.. middle-aged community-dwelling Framingham Heart Study (FHS) par..
.. ticipants. One week of accelerometry-derived PA measures (SED,

.. relatively large sample size permitted assessment of how various com.. binations of SED, steps/day, and MVPA were related to cardiorespira..

have been described.23,24 At their third examination cycle (exam 3;
2016-2019), all participants were offered participation in the CPET
study, and information on their metabolic responses to exercise and
ventilatory efficiency has been reported previously.25-27 Accelerometry
data were obtained during both the second (exam 2; 2008-2011) and
the third (exam 3) examination cycles. At both examinations, participants were asked to wear the accelerometer for 8 days after their
study visit. From a total of 3521 exam 3 participants, 3486 attended
the research centre (n = 35 were home visits), and 3117 completed
CPET, of whom 2408 individuals provided accelerometry data.
Characteristics of individuals with and without accelerometry data at
exam 3 were similar with slightly worse cardiometabolic risk profiles
noted in those who did not provide accelerometry data
(Supplementary material online, Table S1). The majority of participants
resided in New England (84%). We excluded individuals with inadequate volitional effort during exercise (peak respiratory exchange
ratio <1.0; n = 41), insufficient accelerometer wear time (fewer than 3

by-breath gas exchange data were obtained by metabolic cart
(Medgraphics, St. Paul, MN, USA) during four stages of exercise: (i) 2 min
of rest, (ii) 3 min of unloaded ('freewheel') exercise, (iii) a maximum incremental ramp (15 or 25 W/min), and (iv) recovery with 3 min of unloaded
cycling followed by 1 min of rest. The measurement approach for each
CPET variable is detailed in Table 1.

Accelerometry assessment of physical
activity
Participants attending exam 2 and exam 3 were asked to wear an omnidirectional accelerometer (Actical model no. 198-0200-00; Philips
Respironics) for all hours (except when bathing) for 8 days on a belt
worn around the waist.16 Given difficulty in discriminating sleep from
waking wear time, participants at exam 3 were asked to remove the device during sleep. Signals within 0.5-3 Hz and accelerations/decelerations
of 0.05-2 g were grouped into 'counts' or 'steps' at 30-s intervals and
averaged over 1 min. Processing of the data and quality control were performed using the SAS programming language and the first day of wear
was removed from the dataset.28 Non-wear time periods were removed

.. and were defined by the Choi algorithm, as periods of consecutive zero
..
.. counts lasting for at least 90 min with allowance of non-zero counts last.. ing up to 2 min as long as they were surrounded by 30 min intervals of
..
.. consecutive zero counts.29 We further removed 6 consecutive hours of
.. wear with the lowest accumulated counts to exclude potential sleep time
.. that was not removed through application of the Choi algorithm and to
..
.. account for differences in wear time between the two examinations.
.. 'SED' was defined as <100 counts per minute30 and reported as a percent
..
.. of wear time and then standardized to an 18-hour wear day. 'MVPA' was

Statistical analysis
After reviewing variable distributions for normality, peak VO2, VO2 at the
ventilatory anaerobic threshold (VAT), and MVPA were naturallogarithmically transformed and VO2 recovery delay was square root
transformed prior to analysis to reduce the skewness of these variables.
All CPET and PA variables were mean centred and standardized prior to
analysis.
We evaluated the cross-sectional associations of CPET (dependent)
variables with PA measures at exam 3 (independent variables) using multivariable linear regression models adjusted for age, sex, cohort, season of
activity monitor wear (fall: September-November; winter: December-
February; spring: March-May; Summer: June-August), location (New
England vs. others, to account for geographic weather differences that
may affect PA), average minutes of activity monitor wear (for steps and
MVPA), body mass index (BMI), resting systolic blood pressure, hypertension medication use, smoking, diabetes, and prevalent CVD. We evaluated for the evidence of effect modification by clinical variables on the
associations of PA measures and CPET variables using multiplicative interaction terms and the following categorical variables: age (> or <_ the median age of 54 years), sex, BMI (three level categorical variable: <25, 25 to
<30, and >_30 kg/m2), prevalent CVD or diabetes vs. those without prevalent CVD or diabetes, and CVD risk score (three-level categorical

Associations of physical activity
measures with multi-domain measures
of cardiorespiratory fitness
Each PA measure demonstrated a modest linear relation with peak
cardiorespiratory fitness (peak VO2) in unadjusted analyses
(Supplementary material online, Figure S1). In multivariable models
adjusted for clinical risk factors, statistically significant associations for
PA measures with different domains of fitness were observed (Table
3). Each of the PA measures was associated with VO2 responses
reflecting different components of exercise: initiation-moderate level,
late exercise, peak exercise, and recovery (FDR <5% for all, Table 3).
Notably, while steps/day was associated with numerous VO2 measures, it was not significantly associated with heart rate or blood pressure exercise responses. The effect size for a 1-SD higher MVPA was
greater for each of the fitness responses compared with SED and
steps. A 5% higher peak VO2 (corresponding to 1.18 mL/kg/min relative to the mean) was associated with daily averages of 96% higher
MVPA [95% confidence interval (CI) 82-113%; e.g. 22 min more relative to the sample mean], 3458 more steps (95% CI 2942-4193;
expected to take 40 min, assuming an average cadence of 80 steps/
min33), and 182 min less SED (95% CI 131-301) (Figure 1). We did

We then evaluated whether PA measures were complementary

.. VO was estimated for individuals with high vs. low values (in relation
2

.. high SED.
..
Finally, to assess whether the associations of PA and fitness meas..

..
.. clinical categories (Supplementary material online, Table S2 and

Physical activity and components of fitness

Discussion
The principal findings of our study are three-fold. First, in a large sample of community-dwelling individuals, we defined relative associations between three measures of routine PA (MVPA, steps, SED) and
multiple dimensions of cardiorespiratory fitness. MVPA had the highest effect size for exercise response patterns throughout exercise
relative to total steps/day and SED. Specifically, for each minute of increase in average MVPA, >3 min of intermediate cadence walking and
>14 min less SED would be required for the equivalent changes in fitness. Second, we observed linearity in associations of PA measures
and peak VO2 and broad consistency of the associations among categories of age, sex, obesity, and CVD status. Third, the relation of
steps and MVPA with peak VO2 was additive, such that the highest
peak VO2 was observed in individuals with higher values for both
MVPA and steps/day. Interestingly, higher activity levels (both
moderate-to-vigorous and total activity by steps/day) were associated with greater than average fitness levels regardless of the amount

of SED, and above average PA at 8 years prior to CPET and at the
time of CPET similarly influenced fitness. Collectively, these findings
not only provide a detailed assessment of the relation of PA to precise measures of fitness but are also consistent with the notion that
antecedent PA and maintenance of PA over time (specifically MVPA)
may preserve cardiorespiratory fitness.
Greater PA has been associated with higher levels of cardiorespiratory fitness,34,35 but prior reports were mostly limited by relatively narrow inclusion criteria, small sample sizes, and lack of
objective measurement of both PA and fitness. Detailed physiologic
studies have demonstrated that physical inactivity (modeled as prolonged bedrest leading to both high SED and minimal PA) has a
powerful deleterious effect on cardiovascular function and fitness.36
Conversely, in sedentary middle-aged individuals, supervised exercise
training can result in significant benefits in fitness.37 Recently, investigators demonstrated that higher self-reported MVPA was associated
with attenuation of age-related declines in peak VO2 in 1500
middle-aged, community-dwelling individuals.38 By relating different

Estimated beta coefficients represent the change in standardized CPET fitness measure for a 1-SD change in sedentary time (80.1 min/day standardized to an 18-h day), steps/
day (4044 steps), or moderate-vigorous PA (20.7 min/day). Models were adjusted for age, sex, exam 2 PA measure, interval between exams, cohort, season of device wear, location (New England vs. others), discordant season, average minutes of device wear (for steps and moderate-vigorous PA), body mass index, resting systolic blood pressure,
hypertension medication use, smoking (current/former/never), diabetes, and prevalent cardiovascular disease.

forms of objectively measured PA (SED, steps/day, MVPA) to multiple domains of VO2 during exercise, our study builds on these prior
reports and demonstrates that routine PA modalities (as opposed to
dedicated exercise training, per se) are important in building and
maintaining cardiorespiratory fitness throughout the life course.
Peak VO2 is considered the gold standard measure of cardiorespiratory fitness and is closely related to health outcomes
across the entire spectrum of health and disease.39 In our sample,
relative amounts of MVPA, moderate walking, and reduction in
SED were associated with a clinically meaningful difference in fitness (>1-1.2 mL/kg/min of VO2 relative to the mean peak VO2 of
23.6 mL/kg/min) among community-dwelling middle-aged adults.
Importantly, MVPA was linearly related to peak VO2, indicating
that while the guideline-recommended thresholds (>_150 min/week
of MVPA22,40) may be a reasonable benchmark (and closely
approximated mean MVPA levels of 156 min/week observed in
our cohort), higher levels of MVPA would be expected to result
in continued improvements in physical fitness with >3- and >14fold greater efficiency in achieving higher fitness levels than moderate walking or reducing sedentary time. These associations were
consistent among categories of age, sex, BMI, and CVD status,

reinforcing the message that PA is associated with higher levels of
fitness across age and health status.
A unique aspect of this study is the availability of PA measures
across two times over nearly a decade, necessary to understand the
benefits of maintenance of activity over time on cardiorespiratory fitness. Individuals with persistently low activity levels (or high SED) had
lower cardiorespiratory fitness relative to individuals who displayed
an improvement in activity levels over time, though we did not observe differences in peak VO2 in those individuals with discordant
MVPA at the two exam cycles (e.g. high MVPA at exam 2/low MVPA
at exam 3 vs. low MVPA at exam 2/high MVPA at exam 3). Our findings suggest that cumulative exposure to PA may be related to longterm fitness levels.41
In addition to peak VO2, we observed associations of PA measures
with numerous CPET variables reflecting VO2 during initiationmoderate level exercise, late exercise, peak exercise, and recovery.
While MVPA would be expected to promote adaptation to highintensity peak exercise (e.g. peak VO2), we found higher relative effect sizes for MVPA compared to steps or SED in relation to CPET
variables reflecting VO2 throughout exercise, suggesting that MVPA
may promote global adaptation to all intensity levels of exercise. Each

form of PA was associated with CPET measures of VO2 kinetics, but
were less reliably associated with simple hemodynamic measures
such as heart rate and blood pressure responses. While peak global
cardiorespiratory fitness (peak VO2) is closely related to changes in
PA over time, it requires peak volitional effort for accurate ascertainment. Submaximal measures of VO2 kinetics may therefore serve as
sensitive measures (i.e. biomarkers) of the physiologic benefits of discrete PA interventions.
Our study has several limitations. The cross-sectional associations
of PA with fitness measures may be affected by reverse causation.
For example, individuals with lower fitness levels may be less likely
(or unable) to perform PA. By investigating the associations of

changes in PA over 8 years with fitness measures, the issue of reverse
causation is partially addressed, but we still cannot exclude the potential for residual confounding by other determinants of health status that may simultaneously impact cardiorespiratory fitness and the
propensity for PA. Our findings should be interpreted as crosssectional associations; the precise mechanisms explaining the relations of greater PA and higher fitness should be assessed using different study designs and may include formal mediation analysis. Our
sample was mostly middle-aged. Therefore, while we tested for effect
modification by age, we cannot exclude that the associations of PA
with fitness differ at the extremes of age. Moreover, our sample comprised community-dwelling, middle-aged individuals who displayed,

on average, lower than expected fitness levels; whether these relations differ in more fit individuals should be explored in future studies.
One potential explanation for the lower-than-expected peak VO2
values is the use of cycle exercise, which is recognized to result in
lower peak VO2 measures compared to treadmill exercise.42 Finally,
our sample was primarily of European descent and generalizability to
other populations is therefore unknown.
In conclusion, lower SED, and greater steps/day and MVPA (and
their changes over time) were each associated with better cardiorespiratory fitness measures. The highest effect estimate was
observed for MVPA, which was associated with favourable CPET fitness measures throughout various intensity levels of incremental exercise (i.e. from initiation to recovery). These findings are consistent
with the notion that different forms of PA (especially MVPA) are
associated with cardiorespiratory fitness in the general public regardless of one's age, sex, BMI, or CVD status. In addition, our data provide information regarding the relative modifiability of specific
exercise responses and permit scaling of relative changes in SED,
steps/day, and MVPA required to improve fitness.
