Aims

The aim of this study was to understand the impact of optical coherence tomography (OCT)-detected thin-cap
fibroatheroma (TCFA) on clinical outcomes of diabetes mellitus (DM) patients with fractional flow reserve (FFR)negative lesions.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
COMBINE OCT-FFR study was a prospective, double-blind, international, natural history study. After FFR assessment, and revascularization of FFR-positive lesions, patients with >_1 FFR-negative lesions (target lesions) were clasand results

sified in two groups based on the presence or absence of >_1 TCFA lesion. The primary endpoint compared
FFR-negative TCFA-positive patients with FFR-negative TCFA-negative patients for a composite of cardiac mortality, target vessel myocardial infarction, clinically driven target lesion revascularization or unstable angina requiring
hospitalization at 18 months. Among 550 patients enrolled, 390 (81%) patients had >_1 FFR-negative lesions. Among
FFR-negative patients, 98 (25%) were TCFA positive and 292 (75%) were TCFA negative. The incidence of the primary endpoint was 13.3% and 3.1% in TCFA-positive vs. TCFA-negative groups, respectively (hazard ratio 4.65;
95% confidence interval, 1.99-10.89; P < 0.001). The Cox regression multivariable analysis identified TCFA as the
strongest predictor of major adverse clinical events (MACE) (hazard ratio 5.12; 95% confidence interval 2.12-
12.34; P < 0.001).

Thin-cap fibroatheroma predicts clinical events
in diabetic patients with normal fractional flow
reserve: the COMBINE OCT-FFR trial

4672
Conclusions

E. Kedhi et al.

Among DM patients with >_1 FFR-negative lesions, TCFA-positive patients represented 25% of this population and
were associated with a five-fold higher rate of MACE despite the absence of ischaemia. This discrepancy between
the impact of vulnerable plaque and ischaemia on future adverse events may represent a paradigm shift for coronary artery disease risk stratification in DM patients.

Introduction
Fractional flow reserve (FFR) is the most widely used intracoronary
physiology index to guide coronary revascularization strategy in the
catheterization laboratory. The safety of FFR as a decision-making
tool is based upon multiple large randomized trials showing that coronary revascularization can be safely deferred in lesions with
non-ischaemic FFR values (i.e. >0.80), while it is indicated in those
with ischaemic FFR values (i.e. <_0.80).1,2 Notwithstanding the documented safety of FFR in those trials, evidence suggests that in some
patient categories, such as those with diabetes mellitus (DM) and/or
acute coronary syndromes (ACS), decision-making on revascularization based on FFR is associated with an excess of cardiovascular
events, compared to patients without such clinical features.3,4 It has
been proposed that atherosclerosis progression and destabilization
of angiographically intermediate medically treated lesions is considerable in DM patients and responsible for the majority of the adverse
events during the follow-up.5 Particularly, lesions where a thin-cap

fibroatheroma (TCFA) morphology on intravascular ultrasound
(IVUS) assessment was suspected were related to an excess of cardiovascular events.6 Therefore, a tentative hypothesis is that in DM
patients, identification of TCFAs may be more important than ruling
out the presence of flow-limiting lesions in predicting future cardiovascular events. Understanding the impact of TCFAs on the clinical
outcomes of non-flow-limiting lesions finds new opportunities in the
use of optical coherence tomography (OCT), an imaging modality
which, differently from IVUS, has an extremely high-resolution (i.e.
10-20 lm) capable of providing very accurate qualitative information
on plaque composition.7,8 To date, the natural history of OCTdetected TCFA lesions in patients with fast progressing atherosclerosis has not been studied in a prospective and properly powered
fashion. To distinguish between the impact of plaque vulnerability and
ischaemia, we performed a natural history study, focusing on the impact of OCT-detected TCFA on clinical outcome of DM patients
with medically treated, angiographically intermediate but otherwise
non-ischaemic (i.e. FFR-negative) lesions.

Methods
Study design and oversight
The COMBINE FFR-OCT (NCT02989740) is a prospective, doubleblind, international, natural history study that was conducted in 14 sites
across 7 countries. The rationale and design of the COMBINE study has
been published previously.9 This investigator-initiated study was sponsored by Isala Hartcentrum, Zwolle, the Netherlands, and supported
from an unrestricted institutional grant from St Jude Medical/Abbott
Vascular. The principal investigator in collaboration with the steering and
executive committees (see Supplementary material online, Appendix)
was responsible for study design, conduction, and data integrity and
reporting. The study protocol (see the Supplementary material online)
was approved from the national regulatory agencies and the institutional
review boards of all the participating centres.
The first three authors vouched for the accuracy of the reported data.
The trial was conducted from the Diagram BV, an ISO-9-certified CRO
Zwolle, the Netherlands, while the statistical analysis was performed by
the KCRI, Krakow, Poland. St Jude Medical/Abbott Vascular had no role
in the study design, conduction, or reporting of the study results.

Study population
Diabetic mellitus patients undergoing coronary angiography for either
stable coronary disease or ACS were eligible for enrollment if they had at
least one de novo native coronary lesion with a diameter of stenosis between 40% and 80% by visual assessment. In patients who presented with
ACS the culprit-lesion was revascularized first. Lesions that were deemed
by the operator to be clearly severe (>80% diameter stenosis) and/or
had a thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (MI) flow <3 were also eligible for revascularization without physiological assessment. All remaining
intermediate lesions underwent FFR assessment in accordance with
guideline-adherent best practice and represent the target lesions for this

.. study. Patients who had a least one target lesion represent the population
..
.. of this study.
..
Revascularization of the target lesions was guided by the FFR findings.
..
.. Patients with exclusively FFR-positive lesions (i.e. FFR <_0.80) underwent
.. mandatory revascularization. Patients with at least one FFR-negative tar..
.. get lesion (i.e. FFR >0.80) underwent OCT assessment and were further
.. treated by guideline-recommended optimal medical therapy. Following
.. core lab analysis of the OCT findings, patients with FFR-negative lesions
..
.. were further classified as 'TCFA-positive' or 'TCFA-negative' depending
.. on presence or absence of at least one TCFA lesion. The final trial popu..
.. lation was composed of three groups: group A, patients with at least one
.. FFR-negative/TCFA-negative lesion; group B, patients with at least one
..
.. FFR-negative/TCFA-positive lesion; and group C, patients with exclusively
.. FFR-positive lesions, who underwent revascularization (Supplementary
.. material online, Figure S1). The full inclusion and exclusion criteria are pre..
.. sented in the Supplementary Appendix. Patients who after enrollment
.. did not undergo the treatment mandated by the protocol and therefore
..
.. could not be assigned to one of the three groups were excluded from
.. the study (Figure 1). To assure for blinding, the operators were not
... required to perform any OCT analysis during the procedure. In the pro.. cedure report only, the results of the FFR but not of the OCT were
..
.. shared with the treating physicians. The assignment into TCFA-negative
.. or TCFA-positive groups was performed in the core lab and OCT find..
.. ings were blinded to patients, operators as well as the team that per.. formed the clinical follow-up. The current manuscript reports the
..
.. outcomes of the FFR-negative patients, based on the presence or absence
.. of TCFA.
..
..
.. Endpoints and definitions
..
.. The primary endpoint was the incidence of the target lesion-related com.. posite major adverse clinical event (MACE) which was defined as: cardiac
.. death, target vessel MI, clinically driven target lesion revascularization or

OCT analysis
A detailed summary of OCT definitions and analysis methodology is
shown in the Supplementary material online. The OCT analysis was
based on the 'Consensus standards for acquisition, measurement, and
reporting of intravascular optical coherence tomography studies' document from Tearney et al.10 OCT image analysis scrutinized serial crosssectional images of the vessel in every frame of OCT pullback starting
5 mm distal to 5 mm proximal of the OCT-defined lesion border. Signalrich homogeneous plaques were classified as fibrous, signal-poor regions
with diffuse borders were classified as lipidic plaques, and signal-poor
regions with well-defined borders were classified as calcified plaques.
TCFA was defined as any lesion with predominantly lipid-rich plaque
which in the thinnest part of the atheroma cap measures <_65 lm and
lipid arc of >90 on OCT assessment. The OCT analysis was performed
from two investigators (BB and TR), and a third investigator (EK) supervised the analysis. The inter-rater agreement analysis for OCT-defined
TCFA identification revealed kappa = 0.81 (95% confidence interval 0.70-
0.97) and the intra-rater agreement revealed kappa = 0.78 (95% confidence interval 0.61-0.92). The analysis was performed using the CAAS
Intravascular 2.0 software (Pie Medical BV, the Netherlands).

Statistical analysis
The study was powered for superiority for the primary endpoint at
18 months. Assuming a primary endpoint rate in groups A and B of 5%
and 20%, respectively, taking into account a patient distribution between
groups A and B from 70%/30% to 30%/70%, and assuming the number of
patients in group C not to exceed one-third of the entire study population, a total of 500 patients, of whom 334 in groups A and B, was projected to provide a 80% power to reject the null hypothesis with a type I
error rate of 0.05. This sample size calculation took into account a loss to
follow-up up to 7%.
The cumulative incidence of the primary and secondary endpoints was
estimated by using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. Patients
were censured at 546 days or their last known contact. Cox
proportional-hazards models were used to calculate the hazard ratios
and respective 95% confidence intervals. The primary analysis for the primary endpoint was the per-protocol analysis, which was dictated from
the non-randomized nature of this study where the division in FFRnegative, TCFA-positive, or TCFA-negative groups was dependent on
the availability of FFR and OCT data. Enrolled patients who could not be
allocated in any of these groups were excluded from the analysis. A Cox
multivariable regression analysis was performed for the primary endpoint.
P-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Statistical analysis
was performed using JMP 15.1 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC, USA).

.. groups A and B (Table 1).
..
..
Supplementary material online, Table S1 shows the medication at

.. group while the use of P2Y12 inhibitors was higher in the TCFA..
.. positive group. The rest of the cardiac or DM medications was simi.. larly distributed between groups.
..
Per definition, all patients with at least one TCFA lesion were clas..

Lesion level quantitative and qualitative OCT data for TCFA..

..
.. are presented in Table 2. Quantitative and qualitative OCT data of
.. non-TCFA lesions from group B are shown in Supplementary mater..
.. ial online, Table S2. The quantitative analysis showed similar proximal
.. and distal reference lumen diameters between TCFA-positive and
..
.. TCFA-negative lesions.
..
Both the baseline transstenotic pressure index and the FFR were
..
.. similar in both arms (resting distal coronary pressure to aortic pres.. sure ratio 0.95 +/- 0.04 vs. 0.95 +/- 0.04, P = 0.74, FFR 0.88 +/- 0.05 vs.
..
.. 0.88 +/- 0.05, P = 0.66, in group B vs. A); however, TCFA-positive
.. lesions tended to be somewhat longer and have a slightly smaller min..
.. imum lumen area (MLA) as compared to TCFA-negative lesions. The
..
.. qualitative analysis showed that both groups had a similar prevalence
.. of lesion calcification; however, the overall span of the calcium arc
..
.. was larger and the presence of protruding calcification more frequent
.. in TCFA-negative lesions. As may be expected from the TCFA defin..
.. ition, a predominantly lipidic plaque was present in all patients of
.. TCFA-positive lesions. Notably, a lipidic plaque also was the most
..
.. frequent plaque type in TCFA-negative lesions; however, TCFA
.. lesions were characterized by wider lipid arc and significantly higher

hospitalization due to unstable or progressive angina at 18 months in the
FFR-negative and TCFA-positive patients (group B) as compared to the
FFR-negative and TCFA-negative patients (group A). Cardiac death and
unstable angina events that could not clearly be related to events originating from non-target lesions were considered as target lesion-related. A
complete list of definitions can be found in the Supplementary material
online, Appendix. All adverse events were adjudicated by an independent
clinical event committee, with members who were unaware of the patient group allocation.
Patients were considered as suffering from DM if they required medical treatment with insulin or an oral hypoglycaemic agent.

based solely on FFR interrogation and support the use of image-based
methods for more accurate risk profiling in patients with DM.
In our population of DM patients, the MACE rate in the TCFApositive patients was mainly driven by target vessel MI, which

occurred only in this group, and target lesion revascularization, which
occurred 8 times more often in TCFA-positive patients (as compared
to TCFA-negative patients). Interestingly, any-MI rate was also higher
in TCFA-positive patients, a finding that may suggest that presence of
TCFA might be a sign of a more aggressive atherosclerosis disease in
these patients.
Furthermore, the higher rate of clinically driven non-MI-related
target lesion revascularizations might point that TCFA is not only a

predictor of MI but also plaque progression and MLA reduction leading to angina. In fact, a clear trend for a smaller MLA, MLA stenosis
percentage, and longer lesion length was present already at baseline
in TCFA-positive lesions, a finding that is in line with the results from
the COMPLETE-OCT sub study,11 where angiographically obstructive lesions had a higher prevalence of TCFA. Altogether these findings suggest that a similar prevalence of TCFA in patients with or
without ACS at presentation, as was the case in our study, might not
be surprising considering that these syndromes may be different presentations of the same underlying disease, at least in the early phase
of atherosclerosis progression.
Moreover, the incidence of unstable angina was significantly higher
in the TCFA-positive group, although this did not contribute substantially to the primary endpoint outcome as patients who developed
unstable angina generally also underwent a target vessel revascularization. Nevertheless, this finding further supports that the vast majority of repeat revascularizations were truly clinically driven.

Vulnerable plaque, OCT-detected TCFA,
and risk of future adverse events
Thin-cap fibroatheromas originally described as lipid-rich plaques
covered by a fibrous cap of <65 lm, frequently infiltrated by macrophages,12 have been identified from histopathological studies as a substrate for ACS including MI and sudden cardiac death.13 Due to their
frequent association with compensatory vessel remodelling, 90% of
TCFAs are located in large plaques with intermediate or severe
cross-sectional stenosis area of >50%.14 Therefore, future adverse
events are likely to originate from TCFA lesions with at least intermediate degree of stenosis as is the case in our study. As predicted
from aforementioned histopathology work, our study demonstrated

..
.. that the adverse clinical events were clearly clustered in the TCFA.. positive patients.
..
..
The prevalence of TCFA in our study was very similar to that
.. reported in previous studies.15,16 Furthermore, CLIMA, a large pro..
.. spective study by Prati et al.,17 identified TCFA as the strongest
..
.. predictor of adverse cardiovascular events in a patient with angio.. graphically non-obstructive lesions. The current study confirms those
..
.. findings and even expands that message by confirming the impact of
.. TCFA in future MACE in FFR- negative lesions.
..
..
We found a significantly higher prevalence of macrophage infiltra.. tion and neovascularization in the TCFA-positive lesions as com..
.. pared to TCFA-negative lesions, suggesting a higher inflammation
.. level that might eventually lead to fibrous cap destabilization and pla..
.. que rupture.13,18,19
..
Interestingly, while a lipid-rich plaque was also the predominant
..
.. plaque phenotype (about 60%) in the TCFA-negative group, the pri..
.. mary endpoint event rate in this group was very low, suggesting that
.. presence of lipid-rich plaque alone, in the absence of TCFA features
..
.. like thin fibrous cap, macrophage infiltration, and neovascularization,
.. is associated with a low rate of future adverse events and as such a

Clinical relevance of our findings
The main important lesson derived from this study is that at the lesion level the absence of myocardial ischaemia does not predict a low
risk of future events in diabetic patients. The present study shows for
the first time that these OCT-detected vulnerable plaques represent
up to 25% of these angiographically intermediate FFR-negative lesions
but are responsible for >80% of future adverse events despite optimal medical treatment, alternatively the remaining 75% of FFRnegative lesions which do not show vulnerability features are truly at
low risk of future adverse events. Therefore, for the treatment of isolated non-ischaemic but vulnerable coronary lesions, alternative future treatment options need to be explored. Whether plaque
passivation, and/or more potent lipid-lowering drugs provides the future, requires further investigation. Current revascularization guidelines28,29 focus exclusively on the importance of ischaemia and do
not mention once the term 'vulnerable plaque'. Our study and other
recently published studies11,17 have provided important insights by
showing that ischaemia is not the only predictor of future adverse
events, and therefore, intravascular imaging and vulnerable plaque detection merits further attention in future guideline drafting.
Our study has limitations. The results of this study cannot be generalized to all patients with FFR-negative lesions; however, DM
patients represent more than one-third of all patients undergoing
coronary angiography. Baseline differences, arising from the nonrandomized nature of this study, may partly persist despite statistical
adjustment. The statin usage at discharge was higher in the TCFA
negative group; however, it did not significantly impact future MACE.
Conversely, a higher rate of events was observed in the TCFA group
despite a higher use of P2Y12 inhibitors in this group. MI at presentation was found a predictor of future MACE; therefore, whether these
results apply also to stable angina patients requires further investigation. The follow-up window for the primary endpoint had a margin of
+/-3 weeks; therefore in some patients the follow-up might have taken
place 1-3 weeks before the 18-month timeframe. The impact of a
stricter glycaemic or lipidic control on future adverse events is not
deductible from our study and whether an improvement could be
achieved, especially with newer lipid and glycaemic lowering drugs,

..
.. needs to be studied in dedicated trials. The study was underpowered
.. for the detection of differences in low incidence endpoints (e.g. car..
.. diac mortality). Plaque burden, a strong predictor of future adverse
.. events, cannot be well evaluated by OCT; however, a diameter sten..
.. osis >_40-80%, and a MLA of <3 mm2 as was the case in our study
.. may suggest that these patients have also a high plaque burden.
..
.. Plaque assessment by OCT may result in overestimation of the
.. TCFA prevalence; however, OCT remains the most sensitive tool to
..
.. detect TCFA to date.30
..
..
..
.. Conclusions
..
..
.. In conclusion, in DM patients, OCT-detected TCFA is associated
.. with a five-fold higher rate of adverse events despite the absence of
..
.. ischaemia. The clinical demonstration of such discrepancy between
.. the impact of vulnerable plaque and ischaemia on future adverse
..
.. events may represent a paradigm shift for coronary artery disease
.. risk stratification and paves the way for novel therapeutic strategies.

Revascularization deferral of nonculprit stenoses on the basis of fractional flow

between the presence of TCFAs and ischaemic FFR values.22-24
Based on that observation, it was proposed that the safety of deferring revascularization in FFR-negative lesions stems from the twofold benefit of identifying lesions that are non-flow limiting and with a
low risk of triggering acute ischaemic events. Our prospective study
demonstrates that such hypothesis is not correct, at least in patients
with DM and that the presence of TCFAs hosted in non-ischaemic
lesions constitutes an important predictor of future vessel-related
cardiovascular events in these patients. Interestingly, only one-third
of these high or intermediate stenotic lesions that are at high risk of
future adverse events can be detected by FFR1,25 and subsequently
addressed by revascularization. Our findings may explain why an ischaemia-guided revascularization approach can significantly reduce
angina but fails to reduce future adverse events, as was recently
shown by the ISCHEMIA trial.26 Similarly our findings may also explain why surgical revascularization, which by-passes the proximal
epicardial segments where vulnerable lesions are frequently hosted,
has a superior outcome compared to percutaneous coronary intervention in DM patients, as has been shown by the FREEDOM trial.27
