Aims

Risk stratification algorithms for sudden cardiac death (SCD) in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and regional
differences in clinical practice have evolved over time. We sought to compare primary prevention implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implantation rates and associated clinical outcomes in US vs. non-US tertiary HCM
centres within the international Sarcomeric Human Cardiomyopathy Registry.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
We included patients with HCM enrolled from eight US sites (n = 2650) and five non-US (n = 2660) sites and used
and results
multivariable Cox-proportional hazards models to compare outcomes between sites. Primary prevention ICD im-

plantation rates in US sites were two-fold higher than non-US sites (hazard ratio (HR) 2.27 [1.89-2.74]), including in
individuals deemed at high 5-year SCD risk (>_6%) based on the HCM risk-SCD score (HR 3.27 [1.76-6.05]). US ICD
recipients also had fewer traditional SCD risk factors. Among ICD recipients, rates of appropriate ICD therapy were
significantly lower in US vs. non-US sites (HR 0.52 [0.28-0.97]). No significant difference was identified in the incidence of SCD/resuscitated cardiac arrest among non-recipients of ICDs in US vs. non-US sites (HR 1.21 [0.74-1.97]).

Primary Prevention ICD in HCM

Conclusion

Primary prevention ICDs are implanted more frequently in patients with HCM in US vs. non-US sites across the
spectrum of SCD risk. There was a lower rate of appropriate ICD therapy in US sites, consistent with a lower-risk
population, and no significant difference in SCD in US vs. non-US patients who did not receive an ICD. Further
studies are needed to understand what drives malignant arrhythmias, optimize ICD allocation, and examine the impact of different ICD utilization strategies on long-term outcomes in HCM.

Introduction
Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is a grave complication of hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy (HCM), disproportionately affecting young adults.1
Primary prevention implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD) effectively decrease the incidence of SCD;2 however, because many
patients with HCM are relatively young at ICD implantation, they
bear a higher life-time risk of ICD-related complications including device malfunction, infection, and inappropriate ICD therapy.3 Accurate
assessment of risk is essential to ensure the optimal allocation of ICD
devices to patients who stand to benefit the most.4 Risk stratification
algorithms for SCD in HCM have evolved over time with notable

differences in current US and European guidelines.5-8 Whereas the
most recent 2014 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines
endorse a summative approach to risk assessment focusing on a
quantitative predicted risk of SCD using the HCM risk-SCD calculator,7,9 the 2020 American Heart Association (AHA)/American
College of Cardiology (ACC) guidelines emphasize identifying individual risk factors associated with SCD and recommend considering
primary prevention ICD implantation if a single major risk factor is
present.8 These differing approaches emphasize ongoing challenges
of accurate risk stratification and uncertainty about best practice.10 In
this study, we sought to leverage the international Sarcomeric
Human Cardiomyopathy Registry (SHaRe) to compare primary

Methods

Study design and patient population
This study is a retrospective observational study comparing primary prevention ICD utilization and outcomes in US vs. non-US sites within the
SHaRe registry from January 2000 through June 2020. Patients were
included if they were adults, 18 years or older, at the time of initial visit at
a SHaRe site. Only patients diagnosed with HCM after the year 2000, at
which time contemporary ICDs were readily clinically available, were
included in this study. Patients who had secondary prevention ICDs
implanted prior to their first SHaRe site visit were excluded. The study
population included patients with HCM enrolled from eight US sites
(n = 2650) [Brigham and Women's Hospital, MA (n = 486); Boston
Children's Hospital, MA (n = 19); University of Michigan, MI (n = 791);
Cincinnati Children's Hospital, OH (n = 70); University of Pennsylvania,
PA (n = 41), Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, PA (n = 2); Yale-New
Haven Hospital, CT (n = 462); Stanford University, CA (n = 779)] and five
non-US sites (n = 2660) [Cardiomyopathy Unit, University of Florence,
Florence, Italy (n = 1220); Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, the
Netherlands (n = 777); Royal Brompton Hospital, London, United
Kingdom (n = 57); University of S~ao Paulo, Brazil (n = 180); Royal Prince
Alfred Hospital, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia (n = 426)]
(Supplementary material online, Figure S1).

Exposures
Clinical covariates were modelled as time-varying covariates to capture
change in exposure status over time and to allow for accurate adjustment
for risk profile at time of primary prevention ICD implantation. For instance, patients who developed syncope during follow-up were considered free of syncope until the time of event occurrence and carried
forward thereafter. Detailed echocardiographic data were available in a
subset of the study population (n = 4743, 89.3%). Baseline echocardiographic data were carried forward and updated when new echocardiographic data were clinically obtained. Definitions of traditional risk factors
for SCD were harmonized across sites in accordance with guidelines.6-8
Unexplained syncope was defined as one or more recent (within
<6 months) episodes of acute transient loss of consciousness deemed

.. not secondary to neurocardiogenic syncope or attributable to left ven..
.. tricular outflow tract obstruction. Family history of SCD was defined as
.. SCD in >_1 first degree relative under the age of 40 or in a first degree
..
.. relative with confirmed HCM diagnosis regardless of age. Non-sustained
.. ventricular tachycardia was defined as at least three consecutive ventricu..
.. lar beats at a rate >_120 b.p.m., lasting <30 s without associated symp.. toms. Maximal left ventricular wall thickness was categorized according
.. to the guideline-defined cut-off of 30 mm. Left atrial anteroposterior
..
.. diameter was measured from a parasternal long window of the heart.
.. Finally, left ventricular outflow tract gradient was defined as maximal rest,
..
.. Valsalva or exercise gradient measured by 2D Doppler echocardiog.. raphy. The higher of the rest or Valsalva left ventricular outflow tract gra.. dient estimates was included in calculation of the HCM risk-SCD score.
..
.. In calculating the HCM risk-SCD score, echocardiographic parameters
.. from the closest echocardiogram performed before the SHaRe site visit
..
.. were used. In addition, in instances where the upper or lower bounds of
.. the range accepted by the model for individual predictors were violated,
..
.. we imputed the value of the upper or lower limit of the model range, as
.. appropriate (e.g. maximal left ventricular wall thickness of 37 mm was
.. imputed to 35 mm and maximal left ventricular wall thickness of 8 mm
..
.. was imputed to 10 mm). If left ventricular outflow tract gradient was
.. noted as absent in an echocardiogram without a numerical estimate of
..
.. the outflow tract gradient, a value of 10 mmHg was imputed to calculate
.. the HCM risk-SCD score. This approach is commensurate with real.. world clinical use of the HCM risk-SCD score. Data on left ventricular an..
.. eurysm or quantification of late gadolinium enhancement on cardiac mag.. netic resonance imaging are not currently systematically captured in
..
.. SHaRe.
..
..
.. Outcomes
.. The primary endpoint of this study was time-to-primary prevention ICD
..
.. implantation. Primary prevention ICD implantation was defined as
.. prophylactic ICD implantation in individuals who have not experienced
.. symptomatic sustained ventricular arrhythmias or resuscitated cardiac ar..
.. rest. We additionally examined a number of secondary endpoints in clin.. ical outcome analyses comparing outcomes between sites among
..
.. recipients (ICD cohort) and non-recipients (No ICD cohort) of primary
.. prevention ICDs. In the ICD cohort, we compared the incidence of ap..
.. propriate ICD therapy, inappropriate ICD therapy, and all-cause mortal.. ity between US and non-US sites. Appropriate therapy was defined as
.. ICD shocks or anti-tachycardia pacing delivered for clinically adjudicated
..
.. ventricular tachyarrhythmia. Inappropriate therapy was defined as ICD
.. therapy in the setting of supraventricular tachyarrhythmia or device mal..
.. function. In the No ICD cohort, we examined two composite endpoints:
.. SCD composite (SCD or resuscitated cardiac arrest) and non-SCD com.. posite (non-SCD or heart transplant/ventricular assist device implant)
..
.. across US vs. non-US sites. SCD was defined as death within 1 h of onset
.. of cardiac symptoms when witnessed or within 24 h of last being known
..
.. alive and well when unwitnessed.
..
..
.. Statistical analysis
.. Baseline characteristics of US vs. non-US sites are presented as means
..
.. +/- standard deviation or median (interquartile range) for continuous
.. variables and frequency and percent for categorical variables.
.. Unpaired Student's t-test and Pearson chi-squared tests were used to
..
.. compare continuous and categorical variables across the two groups,
.. respectively. Time-to-event analysis with time-varying covariates was
..
.. implemented to compare the primary and secondary endpoints be.. tween US and non-US sites. Follow-up time for the primary endpoint
.. analysis was defined as time from initial SHaRe site visit to either pri..

SHaRe is an international collaborative consortium of high-volume tertiary HCM centres that houses granular longitudinal clinical, imaging, genetic, and outcome data on patients with HCM and their families. The
registry design and initial findings have been previously reported.11
Briefly, a core set of phenotypic variables and outcomes are harmonized
across all participating sites and stored in a secure centralized database.
At initial visit to a SHaRe site, patients undergo a detailed patient history
and medical record review to ascertain clinical diagnoses and historical
events. Prospective longitudinal data are captured by sites as they occur
or during clinical encounters. Every quarter each participating site submits
updated deidentified data to the central database where it is subjected to
auditing tools for checking the completeness and accuracy of the data.
This allows for prospective data capture and the amendment of missing
or inaccurate data prior to incorporation into the registry and maintenance of the fidelity of the data. Each site maintains appropriate institutional review and ethics approval. Depending on individual site practices,
informed consent is obtained or waived based on the de-identified nature
of the study. This study was conducted in compliance with the
Declaration of Helsinki.

requisite component data (n = 4183/5310, 78.8%) and compared the
primary endpoint between sites stratified by low- (<4%),
intermediate- (4-6%), and high-risk (>_6%) categories of SCD. In addition, tests of interaction on the multiplicative scale were performed to
assess for heterogeneity of the impact of SCD risk factors on the decision to implant a primary prevention ICD in US vs. non-US sites. To
examine the effect of introduction of the HCM risk-SCD score in 2014
on ICD implantation rates, we performed a stratified analysis by era:
2000-13 and 2014-20.
We then focused on examining outcomes across sites among recipients and non-recipients of primary prevention ICDs. Among primary prevention ICD recipients, follow-up time for the secondary endpoint
analysis was defined as time from ICD implant to first occurrence of any
of the secondary endpoints, death or last follow-up visit, whichever came
first. In the No ICD group, follow-up time was calculated from time of initial SHaRe site visit to first occurrence of any of the components of the
SCD or non-SCD composite secondary endpoints, death or last followup visit. Individuals who received ICDs during follow-up contributed
follow-up time to the No ICD group until the time they received the
ICD. Multivariable Cox-proportional hazards models were fit to compare

was 51 and 52 years for US and non-US site patients, respectively.
Self-reported white race constituted a larger proportion of the patient population in non-US sites (91.6%) compared to US sites
(71.9%). Additional notable differences in baseline characteristics between the two groups included a higher prevalence of hypertension,
larger left atrial diameter, and higher maximum left ventricular outflow tract gradient among patients with HCM in US sites.
Conversely, patients with HCM from non-US sites were more likely
to have a family history of SCD, and syncope.

Primary prevention ICD implantation:

Among study participants without an ICD implanted at time of initial
SHaRe site visit, 460/2448 and 238/2543 received a primary prevention ICD during follow-up in US and non-US sites, respectively. The

21.4% (95% CI, 18.4-24.2) in non-US centres (log-rank P-value < 0.001) over the study follow-up period (Figure 1). Within the US
and non-US groups, primary prevention ICD utilization rates across
centres were overall similar with the notable exception of Royal
Prince Alfred Hospital having a significantly higher rate of primary
prevention ICD implantation as compared to the other non-US
centres (Supplementary material online, Figure S2). In multivariable
analysis using Cox-proportional hazards models and adjusting for
clinical comorbidities and risk factors for SCD, US sites were associated with a 2.27-fold increased rate of primary prevention ICD implant as compared to non-US sites (HR 2.27, 95% CI 1.89-2.74;
P < 0.001) (Figure 2). Our findings remained unchanged in a sensitivity
analysis after incremental adjustment for echocardiographic parameters in the subgroup of patients where that data were available (HRUS
vs. non-US 3.32, 95% CI 2.48-4.44; P < 0.001) (Supplementary material
online, Figure S3). The HCM risk-SCD score was calculated on a subset of the study sample with data available for all score parameters.
Stratifying the study sample into low (<4%), intermediate (4-6%) and
high (>_6%) 5-year risk for SCD using this summative metric of SCD
risk, revealed a similar two- to three-fold increased rate of primary

independent of SCD risk category (Figure 3).
To examine whether the introduction of the HCM risk-SCD score
in 2014 impacted ICD implantation rates in US and non-US sites, we
performed a stratified analysis by era: 2000-13 (n = 2904) vs. 2014-
20 (n = 3463). We found no evidence of change in overall utilization
of primary prevention ICDs before and after introduction of the
HCM risk-SCD score (2000-13: US NICD = 219/1343; non-US NICD
= 142/1561; 2014-20: US NICD = 241/1825; non-US NICD = 96/
1638) (Supplementary material online, Figure S4). The 5-year cumulative incidence of primary prevention ICD implantation was similar
across eras for US sites (2000-13: 19.7%, 95% CI [17.1-22.3]; 2014-
20: 22.4%, 95% CI [19.5-25.2]) as well as non-US sites (2000-13:
12.0%, 95% CI [9.9-14.1]; 2014-20: 11.7%, 95% CI [8.8-14.5]). In
multivariable analysis stratified by era and adjusting for clinical covariates, we found a similar two-fold excess of primary prevention ICD
implantation in US sites during both eras (HRUS vs. non-US (2000-13)
2.29, 95% CI 1.78-2.96; HRUS vs. non-US (2014-20) 2.27, 95% CI 1.74-

ICD implant among recipients with zero risk factors (n = 277), we
found that most either fell slightly short of the threshold defined
for a continuous risk factor (ex: left ventricular wall thickness) or
had multiple risk enhancers that did not meet the guideline definitions for traditional risk factors. Among the most commonly cited
reasons for ICD implant in this zero-risk factor group were family
history of SCD in second degree relatives or first-degree relatives
without confirmed HCM and at age >40 (n = 65/277, 23.5%),
presence of late gadolinium enhancement on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (n = 56/277, 20.2%), maximal left ventricular wall
thickness between 25 and 30 mm (n = 35/277, 12.6%), remote
(>6 months) or non-arrhythmogenic syncope (n = 30/277, 10.8%),
and implantation of an ICD in the setting of a clinical indication

for a permanent pacemaker (n = 30/277, 10.8%) (Supplementary
material online, Figure S5). Notably, 46/277 (16.6%) patients with
zero traditional SCD risk factors had their ICDs implanted prior
to their first SHaRe site visit and no clear indications for ICD implant were identified by medical record review.
The Kaplan-Meier unadjusted survival estimates among primary
prevention ICD recipients revealed a lower incidence of mortality
(NUS = 16/611; Nnon-US = 16/335) and appropriate ICD therapy
(NUS = 41/611; Nnon-US = 28/335) in US vs. non-US sites with no
difference in incidence of inappropriate therapy (NUS = 43/611;
Nnon-US = 30/335) (Figure 6 and Supplementary material online,
Figure S6). In multivariable analysis, ICD recipients in US sites had
a significantly lower incidence of appropriate ICD therapy (HR
0.52, 95% CI 0.28-0.97; P = 0.04) that manifested approximately
5 years following ICD implant. In the multivariable analysis examining all-cause mortality, there was an effect suggesting reduced

threshold for statistical significance (HR 0.42, 95% CI 0.17-1.02;
P = 0.06). Finally, there was no difference in inappropriate ICD
therapy among the two groups in multivariable analysis (HR 0.63,
95% CI 0.38-1.06; P = 0.10).

No ICD cohort outcomes: US vs. non-US
A total of 2512 and 2577 patients from US and non-US sites, respectively, contributed person-time to the No ICD cohort (Table 1). The
majority of patients who did not receive a primary prevention ICD in
both US (81.9%) and non-US sites (79.6%) had no traditional SCD
risk factors (Figure 5). However, non-US sites had a trend towards a
higher proportion of non-recipients of ICDs with at least one SCD
risk factor as compared to US sites (20.4% vs. 18.1%; P = 0.07).
Despite the higher proportion of individuals with at least one SCD
risk factor in non-US sites, survival free of the composite SCD (SCD
or resuscitated cardiac arrest; Figure 7) and the composite non-SCD
(non-SCD, heart transplant or ventricular assist device implant;
Supplementary material online, Figure S7) endpoint was similar between US and non-US sites. Fifty-two (NSCD = 17, Nresuscitated cardiac
arrest = 35) and 45 (NSCD = 16, Nresuscitated cardiac arrest = 29) composite SCD events occurred over follow-up in US and non-US sites in
the No ICD cohort, respectively. In the multivariable analysis, we
found no association between US vs. non-US sites and the SCD (HR

Discussion
In this international multi-centre study of tertiary HCM centres, we
found that primary prevention ICD utilization was approximately
two-fold higher in US sites compared to non-US sites, even after
accounting for well-established risk factors for SCD. Recipients of
primary prevention ICDs in US sites had a lower burden of SCD risk
factors than non-US sites. Consistent with the milder SCD risk profile
of ICD recipients in US sites, we found a significantly lower incidence
of appropriate therapy, predominantly ICD shocks, among ICD
recipients in US vs. non-US sites. The higher rate of ICD implantation
in US vs. non-US sites was seen even among individuals deemed at
highest risk for SCD (5-year risk of SCD >_6%) based on the HCM
risk-SCD score. Despite the higher burden of SCD risk factors
among patients who did not receive ICDs in non-US sites, we did not
detect a significant excess of SCD or resuscitated cardiac arrest
among non-recipients of primary prevention ICDs in non-US sites
(Graphical Abstract). These results highlight the limitations of current
strategies for risk stratification, as well as regional heterogeneity in
practice trends, patient and provider preferences, and risk tolerance.
While ICDs have been successfully deployed to reduce the burden
of SCD in patients with HCM, further collaborative efforts are
needed to improve the accuracy of risk stratification of SCD in HCM
and to optimize healthcare resource utilization and patient
outcomes.
Since the advent of ICDs, it has been a high priority to accurately
identify patients with HCM at risk of SCD to prevent the tragic loss
of young lives. However, the low rate of SCD in HCM creates significant challenges in devising accurate risk-stratification schemes that
maximize both sensitivity and specificity.12 A number of riskstratification algorithms for SCD in patients with HCM have been
proposed and highlighted in iterations of treatment guidelines and
consensus documents.5-8 Two main paradigms have arisen over time
with varying emphasis on sensitivity and specificity.10 The first,
endorsed by the AHA/ACC guidelines, recommends a single risk factor approach for identifying candidates for primary prevention
ICDs.5,6,8 The second, endorsed by the ESC, recommends quantitative SCD risk assessment using the HCM risk-SCD score to bin
patients into risk categories that guide the decision to implant a primary prevention ICD.7 At the heart of both paradigms is shared
decision-making with an adequately informed patient because realworld decision-making for ICD utilization is nuanced and not uncommonly forced to deviate from strict adherence to guideline
recommendations.
Despite numerous studies confirming the increased risk of SCD
associated with established SCD risk factors, the positive predictive
value of individual risk factors remains low, typically <20%.12 As a result, pursuing ICD implantation based on the presence of a single risk
factor may result in exposing patients with HCM to possible adverse
effects associated with ICDs3 with limited benefit. Indeed, in this
study, we identified a two-fold higher rate of ICD implantation and
lower rate of appropriate ICD therapy in US sites. On the other
hand, O'Mahony et al.9 developed a 5-year SCD risk calculator from

a longitudinal multi-centre study of European HCM centres, assigning
weighted coefficients to individual risk factors and assessing risk
across the spectrum of continuous variables. The HCM risk-SCD
score was externally validated in an international cohort with reasonably good discrimination (c-index 0.70), but it tended to overestimate observed SCD risk in those with predicted intermediate
and high SCD risk.13 The risk score was incorporated into the 2014
ESC HCM guidelines and expert consensus-driven risk categories
were defined in an effort to optimize allocation of primary prevention
ICDs.7 In our current study, we did not identify an obvious change in
primary prevention ICD utilization in non-US sites following the
2014 ESC guidelines. In addition, primary prevention ICDs appeared
to be under-utilized in non-US sites even among the high SCD risk
category (HCM risk-SCD score >_6%) where ICDs are recommended by the ESC guidelines. It remains to be determined whether
this reflects a slow adoption of the risk score into clinical practice in

non-US sites, or that the score is used as a component of a multipronged approach to clinical risk assessment. Despite the lower rate
of ICD implantation across the spectrum of SCD risk in non-US sites,
no significant excess SCD or resuscitated cardiac arrest was identified
among HCM patients who did not receive a primary prevention ICD
in non-US sites. Thus, neither approach is yet optimized and our
study findings suggest that there is an opportunity to improve guideline recommendations and primary prevention ICD allocation without compromising SCD outcomes in patients with HCM.
The higher ICD implantation rate seen in the USA was independent of quantifiable SCD risk and definable risk factors. In exploring
the association of individual risk factors with primary prevention ICD
implantation, separately, in US vs. non-US sites, we found that maximum left ventricular wall thickness and family history of SCD were
stronger predictors of ICD implantation in US than in non-US sites.
Thus, the difference in primary prevention ICD utilization between

Limitations
This is a largely retrospective observational study and despite adjusting for a comprehensive array of clinical and echocardiographic
parameters associated with SCD, we cannot exclude the presence of
residual confounding. The overall study follow-up time was relatively
short and event rates for SCD and cardiac arrest are low, limiting our
ability to detect differences in outcomes between US and non-US
sites. Thus, findings from the outcome analysis should be interpreted
with caution. Further studies of large cohorts with long-term followup are needed to more definitively examine how differences in ICD
utilization impact clinical outcomes. Echocardiographic parameters
and HCM risk-SCD score were not available for all patients. Analyses
that adjusted for these covariates were thus limited to a subgroup of
the overall population and may be susceptible to bias. However, our
main analysis findings are congruent with sensitivity analyses that further adjusted for echocardiographic and HCM risk-SCD score, suggesting that there is no significant selection bias in the subgroup with
non-missing parameters. Furthermore, several risk factors associated
with SCD, including late gadolinium enhancement and left ventricular
apical aneurysm, were not systematically available in SHaRe, which
prevented us from accounting for these risk factors in our analysis.
Our findings reflect practice trends in select HCM tertiary centres in
US and non-US sites (tertiary centres from Europe, South America,
and Australia) participating in SHaRe. Practice at these sites is not necessarily fully representative of national/continental practices and
likely does not exclusively draw from guideline recommendations.
While ICD implantation rates were overall similar comparing US sites
to each other and non-US sites to each other, Royal Prince Alfred
Hospital in Sydney, Australia, was an outlier compared to other nonUS sites and had ICD implantation rates on par with US sites
(Supplementary material online, Figure S2). Although this would be
expected to drive our results closer to the null, we nonetheless
detected a significantly higher rate of primary prevention ICD
implantation and lower rate of appropriate ICD therapy in US vs.

.. non-US sites. Moreover, in a sensitivity analysis excluding
.. Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Sydney, Australia, we found no differ..
.. ence in the SCD composite endpoint between US and non-US sites
.. (HRUS vs. non-US 1.20, 95% CI 0.71-2.02; P = 0.49). Data on ICD pro..
.. gramming were not available; thus, we cannot exclude that differen.. ces in rates of ICD therapy were not due to heterogeneity in device
..
.. programming between sites. However, of the 69 appropriate thera.. pies, 64 were ICD shocks that usually reflect underlying life..

.. In this large, multicentre registry of patients with HCM receiving care

US and non-US sites may be partly secondary to differences in perceived risk attributed to individual risk factors. In particular, a real-life
experience with SCD in a family member may be perceived differently in different cultures and may trigger different patient preferences.
The true dilemma is trying to balance the degree of SCD risk individual patients and clinicians are willing to tolerate against the cost
deemed justifiable in unnecessary primary prevention ICD implantations to prevent an SCD event. This balance, and therefore practice,
will vary based on patient/provider preferences and risk perception/
tolerance, as well as societal, cultural, economic, and healthcare system differences between US and non-US sites. Indeed, higher ICD
utilization in the USA is not restricted to HCM. Similar trends have
been reported for ICD utilization in heart failure patients. Seidl and
Senges14 found a four-fold higher rate of overall ICD implantation in
the USA compared to Western Europe, Canada, and Australia. This
pattern of relative over-utilization of ICDs in heart failure patients in
US sites13 and under-utilization in non-US sites15-17 is present despite
overlapping international guideline criteria for ICD implantation,18,19
supporting the theory that inherent non-clinical factors contribute to
the differences in ICD utilization. However, we were unable to examine the impact of these factors on ICD utilization in this study as these
data are not captured in the SHaRe registry.
