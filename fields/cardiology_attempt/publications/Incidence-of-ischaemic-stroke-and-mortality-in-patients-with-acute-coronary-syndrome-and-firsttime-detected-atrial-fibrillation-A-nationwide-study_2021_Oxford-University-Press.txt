what's the difference?', by W.L. Bor and J.M. ten Berg, https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab689.

Aims

The aim of this study was to examine contemporary data on the 1-year prognosis of patients surviving acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and concomitant first-time detected atrial fibrillation (AF).

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
Using Danish nationwide registries, we identified all patients surviving a first-time admission with ACS from 2000
and results
to 2018 and grouped them into (i) those without AF prior to or during ACS; (ii) those with a history of AF; and
(iii) those with first-time detected AF during admission with ACS. With 1 year of follow-up, rates of ischaemic
stroke, death, and bleeding were compared between study groups using multivariable adjusted Cox proportional
hazards analysis. We included 161 266 ACS survivors: 135 878 (84.2%) without AF, 18 961 (11.8%) with history of
AF, and 6427 (4.0%) with first-time detected AF at admission with ACS. Compared to those without AF, the
adjusted 1-year rates of outcomes were as follows: ischaemic stroke [hazard ratio (HR) 1.38 (95% CI 1.22-1.56)
for patients with history of AF and HR 1.67 (95% CI 1.38-2.01) for patients with first-time detected AF]; mortality
[HR 1.25 (95% CI 1.21-1.31) for patients with history of AF and HR 1.52 (95% CI 1.43-1.62) for patients with
first-time detected AF]; and bleeding [HR 1.22 (95% CI 1.14-1.30) for patients with history of AF and HR 1.28
(95% CI 1.15-1.43) for patients with first-time detected AF].

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
In patients with ACS, first-time detected AF appeared to be at least as strongly associated with the 1-year rates of
ischaemic stroke, mortality, and bleeding as compared with patients with a history of AF.

Introduction
Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is frequently accompanied by atrial
fibrillation (AF), which may be previously known or first-time
detected. Previously known AF is well-recognized to further aggravate the prognosis of patients with ACS; however, contemporary,
unselected data on the subgroup of patients admitted with first-time
detected AF are sparsely examined, and especially missing in a nationwide setting. First-time detected AF at admission with ACS has been
reported with highly variable estimates (4.1-37.0%) and has been
identified with an increased associated risk of mortality, stroke, and
myocardial infarction (MI).1-11 However, the associated prognosis of
first-time detected AF in ACS is yet to be further elucidated; data
from previous studies on this matter have been conducted on
selected study cohorts, and only few have been addressed since nonvitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) were recommended more
widely in AF management in 2010.12
To prevent ischaemic stroke in patients with AF, treatment with
vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) or NOACs is indicated13,14 but has not
shown net clinical benefit in the secondary prevention of MI when
bleeding is taken into account.15,16 Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT)
with a P2Y12 inhibitor and aspirin is proven to reduce the incidence
of atherothrombotic events and stent thrombosis14 but does not
provide adequate protection against AF-related strokes.14,17,18 Over
the course of the study period, oral anticoagulant (OAC) treatment
strategies have changed; first, regarding the indication for OAC and,
second, the recommendations to prefer NOACs over VKAs.19

..
Thus, according to guidelines on patients with ACS treated with
..
.. percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), DAPT is indicated, but
..
.. when patients present with concomitant AF, an initial period of triple
.. therapy may be needed;4 however, balancing the high risk of bleeding
..
.. is a well-known difficult clinical scenario.20-22
..
Clarifying the 1-year rates of adverse outcomes in ACS survivors,
..
.. and especially the incidence of ischaemic stroke, all-cause mortality,
..
.. and bleeding, in patients with ACS based on the type of AF (history
.. of AF vs. first-time detected AF) is of importance to understand the
..
.. magnitude of the problem.4,23 It is also a necessary step before an in.. depth investigation of the optimal treatment strategy of antiplatelet/
..
.. anticoagulant therapy in this patient subgroup.
..
In a nationwide Danish cohort, we set out to examine the associ..
.. ated 1-year rates of ischaemic stroke, all-cause mortality, and bleed..
.. ing in patients with ACS presenting with first-time detected AF. We
.. mapped out the practice patterns for antithrombotic therapy follow..
.. ing ACS and investigated the associated outcomes.

In patients with acute coronary syndrome, first-time detected atrial fibrillation appears at least as strongly, or even higher, associated with the 1-year rates
of ischaemic stroke as for patients with a history of atrial fibrillation, while <50% were treated with oral anticoagulation therapy.

Incidence of ischaemic stroke and mortality

Classification of Diseases (ICD) (ICD-8 and ICD-10 codes) and surgical
procedures classified according to the Nordic Medico-Statistical
Committee since 1996;24 (ii) the Danish Civil Registration System, which
holds information on sex, vital status, migration, and birthdate;25 (iii) the
Danish National Prescription Registry, which holds records on all claimed
drug prescriptions since 1995;26 and (iv) the Danish Registry of Causes of
Death, which contains information on date, cause, and place of death.27
The Danish registries are validated, previously described in detail, and of
high quality.28,29

The study population constituted patients surviving a first-time admission
with ACS from 2000 to 2018 diagnosed with unstable angina pectoris
(UAP) or MI (ICD-10 codes: I200 and I21, respectively). The study population was grouped into (i) patients without AF (ICD-8 codes: 42793 and
42794; ICD-10 code: I48) prior to or during the admission with ACS; (ii)
patients with history of AF; and (iii) patients with first-time detected AF.
History of AF was defined by either of three criteria: (i) an inpatient or
outpatient diagnosis code of AF any time prior to admission with ACS; (ii)
a filled prescription of amiodarone, digoxin, dronedarone, or flecainide
prior to admission with ACS; and (iii) a filled prescription of OAC agents
within 6 months of ACS and without a previous diagnosis of venous
thromboembolism. First-time detected AF was defined as a diagnosis
code of AF during admission with ACS with no prior history of AF. The
population-based diagnosis codes are previously validated with a positive
predictive value (PPV) of 88% for UAP, 88-97% for MI, and 95% for AF.29

Covariates
Patients' medical history was assessed from the DNPR as an in- or outpatient visit with a diagnosis at any time prior to admission with ACS.
Hypertension was defined from the use of claimed drug prescriptions, as
done previously.30 Concomitant pharmacotherapy was assessed from
the Danish National Prescription Registry during a period of 6 months
prior to admission with ACS. The estimated risk of stroke (CHA2DS2VASc score) and estimated risk of bleeding [a modified HAS-BLED score
(international normalized ratio was left out due to a lack of data)] were
calculated according to previous studies.31,32 Supplementary material online, Tables S1 and S2 list all classification codes used for medical history
and pharmacotherapy, respectively.

Follow-up and outcomes
The primary outcome was hospital admission with ischaemic stroke or
unspecified stroke (ICD-10 codes: I63-64, respectively, previously validated with a PPV of 97%33). Unspecified stroke was classified as ischaemic
because studies have shown that more than two-third of unspecified
strokes coded in the DNPR are ischaemic.33,34 We had three secondary
outcomes: (i) all-cause mortality; (ii) hospital admission with a diagnosis
of bleeding; and (iii) hospital admission with a diagnosis of MI. Bleeding
was defined as an intracranial, urinary tract, respiratory, gastrointestinal,
retroperitoneal, or eye bleed leading to hospital admission
(Supplementary material online, Table S1). This definition has been validated in similar databases with a PPV of 89-99%.35
Patients surviving hospitalization for ACS were followed from the date
of discharge until the occurrence of the respective outcomes, new-onset
AF (for patients without AF), death, end of study period (31 December
2018), or a maximum of 1 year of follow-up, whichever came first.

Statistics
Baseline characteristics were compared by study groups. Categorical variables were presented as counts and percentages, and continuous variables were presented as medians with interquartile ranges (IQR). The

cumulative incidence of ischaemic stroke, recurrent MI, and bleeding was
examined using the Aalen-Johansen estimator assessing death as a competing risk. Differences between groups were assessed with Gray's test.
Mortality was examined using Kaplan-Meier estimates. The associated
rates of outcomes were examined using multivariable adjusted Cox proportional hazards analysis, including the following covariates: study
groups, sex, age, calendar year, treatment with statins, and known comorbidities at admission date (including hypertension, heart failure, chronic ischaemic heart disease, previous stroke, previous transient ischaemic
attack, diabetes, previous malignancy, chronic renal failure, and coronary
artery bypass graft during admission). When examining the associated
rate of bleeding, the model further included previous liver disease, previous bleeding disorders, treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs, and alcohol abuse.
The assumption of proportional hazards was investigated using
Martingale's residuals. When assessing the 1-year rates of recurrent MI,
the assumption of proportional hazards was violated, which is why a landmark analysis was conducted on patients surviving beyond 14 days of discharge. Additional landmark analyses were conducted at 30 and 60 days
beyond ACS discharge. Age and calendar year were included as continuous variables in the regression analysis and tested for linearity. Sex and
age were tested as effect modifiers on the main outcome. All statistical
analyses were performed using the SAS statistical software (version 9.4,
Cary, NC, USA) and R (version 3.6.1 The R Foundation, Vienna,
Austria).36 Level of statistical significance was recognized by a P-value
<0.05.

Subgroup analysis-antithrombotic therapy and
associated outcomes
In patients surviving 90 days after ACS discharge, practice patterns for
prescribed antithrombotic medication were examined based on filled
prescriptions within 90 days of discharge. Data were stratified on
whether patients were treated with PCI or not. Antithrombotic therapy
was divided into (i) no antithrombotic therapy; (ii) aspirin only; (iii) P2Y12
inhibitors only (ticagrelor, clopidogrel, and prasugrel); (iv) DAPT (aspirin
and a P2Y12 inhibitor); (v) OAC therapy only [dabigatran, rivaroxaban,
apixaban, edoxaban (NOACs), or warfarin (VKA)]; (vi) OAC and either
aspirin or a P2Y12 inhibitor; and (vii) triple therapy with DAPT and OAC.
All patients who developed AF within 90 days of discharge were
excluded. Incidence and adjusted rates of ischaemic stroke, mortality, and
bleeding were examined in three groups: (i) those with no prescribed
antithrombotic therapy; (ii) those with prescribed antiplatelet therapy
(aspirin only, P2Y12 inhibitors only, and DAPT) (reference group); and
(iii) those with prescribed OAC agents (OAC only, OAC, either aspirin
or a P2Y12 inhibitor, and DAPT with OAC).

Sensitivity analyses
To test the robustness of our findings, six supplementary analyses were
conducted. First, three consecutive matches on sex, age, and index date
(ACS discharge) were conducted in a 1:1 ratio: (i) history of AF matched
with controls without AF; (ii) first-time detected AF matched with controls without AF; and (iii) first-time detected AF matched with controls
with history of AF. From the matched study groups, associated rates of
outcomes were assessed. Second, the associated rate of ischaemic stroke
was analysed in stroke-naive patients. Third, to ensure that estimates
were stable across calendar periods, since guideline alterations regarding
OAC in AF was sharpened in 2010,12 rates of ischaemic stroke were
examined for a population restricted to admissions in 2010-18. Fourth,
incidence and adjusted rates of ischaemic stroke and mortality were
examined in a study population narrowed down to include only patients
admitted with MI (i.e. excluding patients with UAP). Fifth, the in-hospital

mortality was examined in all patients admitted with ACS and the
adjusted likelihood of in-hospital mortality was examined with multivariable logistic regression model including the previously mentioned variables. Sixth, to test differences between patients with first-time detected
AF and history of AF, we changed the reference group when examining
rates of ischaemic stroke and mortality.

Ethics
This project was approved by the Danish Data Agency with the project
number P-2019-348. In Denmark, registry-based studies in which individuals cannot be identified do not require ethics committee approval.

Results
Study population and baseline
characteristics
From 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2018, 161 266 patients were
admitted with ACS and survived until discharge (Figure 1). Among
these, 135 878 (84.2%) patients had no AF previous to or during their
admission with ACS (64.0% male, median age 66.0 years, IQR 56.0-
76.0), 18 961 (11.8%) patients had a history of AF (56.1% male, median age 78.0 years, IQR 70.0-84.0), and 6427 (4.0%) patients presented with first-time detected AF (55.8% male, median age

..
.. 76.0 years, IQR 68.0-82.0). The patient group without AF presented
.. with the least comorbidities, while the group with history of AF pre..

Incidence of bleeding
The crude cumulative 1-year incidence of bleeding was 3.6%, 6.9%,

AF [HR 1.28 (95% CI 1.15-1.43)].

Antithrombotic therapy and associated
outcomes
We identified 151 332 patients surviving 90 days after ACS discharge
of which 86 367 were not treated with PCI, while 64 965 were
treated with PCI during admission. Patients with first-time detected
AF, who were not treated with PCI during admission (n = 4359),
were mostly prescribed with aspirin only (24.9%) or OAC only
(14.4%) and overall, 36.0% initiated OAC treatment with or without
combination therapy (Table 2). Patients with first-time detected AF,
who were treated with PCI during admission (n = 1650), were mostly
prescribed with DAPT (35.6%) or triple therapy (27.6%) and overall,
46.3% initiated OAC treatment with or without combination therapy
(Graphical Abstract) (Table 2). A similar pattern of prescriptions of
antithrombotic therapy in patients with a history of AF was seen and
overall, 40.7% and 44.2% received OAC treatment in those treated
without PCI and with PCI, respectively (Graphical Abstract) (Table 2).
For the examination of prescribed antithrombotic therapy and incidence of ischaemic stroke, patients treated with OAC showed the
lowest cumulative incidence of ischaemic stroke in patients with

history of AF and first-time detected AF (Supplementary material online, Figure S3). In adjusted analysis with antiplatelet therapy as reference, OAC showed decreased associated rates of ischaemic stroke
in patients with history of AF [HR 0.87 (95% CI 0.63-1.20)] and firsttime detected AF [HR 0.78 (95% CI 0.41-1.47)], although the difference was not statistically significant (Supplementary material online,
Table S3). Furthermore, a significantly decreased associated rate of
mortality and a non-significantly increased associated rate of bleeding
were observed for patients in both AF groups receiving OAC
(Supplementary material online, Table S3).

Table 2

71 608 patients were enrolled with ACS (60 287 without AF; 8461
with history of AF; and 2860 with first-time detected AF). In adjusted
analyses, the associated rates of ischaemic stroke were HR 1.24 (95%
CI 1.16-1.32) for those with history of AF and HR 1.62 (95% CI
1.47-1.79) for those with first-time detected AF, as compared with
those without AF. In the period from 2000 to 2009, the proportion
of patients treated with OAC on admission was 32.3% for patients
with history of AF. This proportion was 55.0% for the period 2010-
18. Forth, when the study population was narrowed down to include
patients with MI only (UAP excluded), results yielded similar findings
to the main result (Supplementary material online, Figure S4). Fifth,
179 993 patients were admitted with ACS (149 635 without AF; 22
933 with history of AF; and 7425 with first-time detected AF). The inhospital mortality was 9.5%, 15.9%, and 13.5% for patients without
AF, history of AF, and first-time detected AF, respectively. In adjusted
analysis, this corresponded to an odds ratio (OR) of 1.12 (95% CI
1.07-1.17) for patients with history of AF and OR 1.02 (95% CI 0.90-
1.10) for patients with first-time detected AF. Finally, when patients
with history of AF were considered the reference group, we found
an associated higher rate of ischaemic stroke, though not statistically
significant [HR 1.21 (95% CI 0.98-1.49)], for patients with first-time
detected AF. Regarding mortality, first-time detected AF was associated with higher mortality [HR 1.22 (95% CI 1.14-1.30)] as compared
with history of AF.

Discussion
This nationwide observational study examined the association of ischaemic stroke and other adverse outcomes in patients presenting
with first-time detected AF at ACS admission. First, our study
showed that in patients with ACS, first-time detected AF appeared to
be at least as strongly, or even higher, associated with the 1-year rates
of ischaemic stroke, mortality, and bleeding as compared with
patients with a history of AF. Second, similar practice patterns for
prescription of antithrombotic therapy following ACS discharge
were found in patients with history of AF and first-time detected AF,
while <50% were treated with OAC therapy.

Six additional analyses were conducted to test the robustness of our
results. First, for the sex- and age-matched analysis, baseline characteristics are shown in Supplementary material online, Table S4. The
crude and adjusted rates of outcomes in the matched study groups
corresponded to the previously reported outcomes (i.e. increased
rates of adverse outcomes in patients with AF, except for the rate of
recurrent MI) (Supplementary material online, Table S5).
Furthermore, compared to controls with history of AF, similar associated rates of bleeding and ischaemic stroke, and increased associated rates of mortality, and recurrent MI were observed for patients
with first-time detected AF. Second, in stroke-naive patients with
ACS (148 366 patients included), we identified no differences in the
associated rate of ischaemic stroke as compared to the main results.
Third, when restricting data to include patients from 2010 to 2018,

The relation between MI, new-onset AF, and stroke was evaluated
in the Optimal Trial in Myocardial Infarction with the Angiotensin II
Antagonist Losartan (OPTIMAAL) from 2005.3 In this randomized
trial, new-onset AF carried an adjusted HR of 14.6 (95% CI 5.87-
36.3) and 2.29 (95% CI 1.43-3.68) for stroke during the first 30 days
after randomization and the whole duration of follow-up, respectively. Since the OPTIMAAL trial, other retrospective studies have investigated the prognostic impact of new AF in the setting of a MI.1,2,5,9-11
Most studies, however, have been based on selected patient cohorts
or extracted from data prior to the introduction of NOACs in standard AF management.12 Recently, Fauchier et al.11 published a French
nationwide study on patients admitted with MI, demonstrating
increased associated 1-year rates of ischaemic stroke in patients with
new AF as compared with patients with history of AF. These results
may partially be carried by the inclusion of in-hospital mortality, as
patients in the French study were followed from the date of MI admission. Furthermore, Fauchier et al. did not examine antithrombotic
treatment patterns, which may have varied between the two groups
and affected the results. In adjusted analysis, we found that first-time
detected AF was associated with a higher rate of stroke than history
of AF, although this was non-significant. With contemporary data,
from a nationwide cohort, our study is the first to describe similarly
increased rates of ischaemic stroke in patients with history of and
first-time detected AF following ACS discharge.
A multitude of studies has shown increased rates of mortality in
patients with ACS and history of or first-time detected AF.1,2,5-11 In
line with these observations, our study suggests that first-time
detected AF in ACS is at least as strongly associated with mortality as
compared with patients with previously known AF.
The present study found mixed results regarding recurrent MI
rates in the study groups. Initially, within 14 days of discharge, the AF
groups showed lower MI rates compared to patients without AF. For
the remaining follow-up, only including those surviving the acute
phase of 14 days post-discharge, patients with first-time detected AF
yielded an increased associated rate of MI, which is concurrent with
previous studies.1,9 Speculations on this finding include triple therapy
for patients with AF; however, a higher burden of cardiovascular risk
factors is also possible.
Some studies have investigated the incidence of bleeding in ACS
survivors with concomitant first-time detected AF, which is of significant interest in relation to the antithrombotic treatment needed in
this patient group. An American randomized controlled trial was
conducted on patients with AF (paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent) who had successfully undergone PCI.37 This trial showed
increased rates of bleeding in patients treated with post-operative triple therapy compared with DAPT (26.9% vs. 15.4%). This study,
however, did not differentiate between history of AF or first-time
detected AF. In a Spanish cohort study enrolling 1361 patients with
AF, Rivera-Caravaca et al.38 found that initiation of warfarin in OACnaive patients, as are those who typically develop AF in relation to
ACS, was associated with the increased risk of bleeding, which can result in the cessation of antithrombotic medication and thus in the
increased risk of new thromboembolic events. Our study found that
the cumulative incidence of bleeding was 3.6%, 6.9%, and 5.7% for
patients without AF and history of AF and first-time detected AF, respectively. These nationwide data thus present novel knowledge on

Incidence of ischaemic stroke and mortality

Conclusions
In ACS survivors, first-time detected AF appeared to be at least as
strongly, or even higher, associated with the 1-year rates of ischaemic
stroke, mortality, and bleeding as compared with patients with a history of AF. Practice patterns of antithrombotic therapy in patients
with first-time detected AF were similar to patients with history of
AF, while <50% were treated with OAC therapy.

AF secondary to ACS or existing, undiagnosed AF) could not be
determined. Third, bleeding could not be classified according to the
International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis criteria nor the
Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction bleeding criteria; however, the
bleeding was of an admission-requiring magnitude. Finally, our study
included patients hospitalized from 2000 to 2018, and while guidelines for treatment regimens for AF were drastically changed in
2010,12 supplementary results yielded similar findings to the main
analysis.
