Aims

Fractional flow reserve (FFRCT) using computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) determines both the
presence of coronary artery disease and vessel-specific ischaemia. We tested whether an evaluation strategy based
on FFRCT would improve economic and clinical outcomes compared with standard care.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
Overall, 1400 patients with stable chest pain in 11 centres were randomized to initial testing with CTCA with seand results
lective FFRCT (experimental group) or standard clinical care pathways (standard group). The primary endpoint was

total cardiac costs at 9 months. Secondary endpoints were angina status, quality of life, major adverse cardiac and
cerebrovascular events, and use of invasive coronary angiography. Randomized groups were similar at baseline.
Most patients had an initial CTCA: 439 (63%) in the standard group vs. 674 (96%) in the experimental group, 254
of whom (38%) underwent FFRCT. Mean total cardiac costs were higher by lb114 (th8%) in the experimental group,
with a 95% confidence interval from -lb112 (-8%) to thlb337 (th23%), though the difference was not significant
(P = 0.10). Major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events did not differ significantly (10.2% in the experimental
group vs. 10.6% in the standard group) and angina and quality of life improved to a similar degree over follow-up in
both randomized groups. Invasive angiography was reduced significantly in the experimental group (19% vs. 25%,
P = 0.01).

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
A strategy of CTCA with selective FFRCT in patients with stable angina did not differ significantly from standard
clinical care pathways in cost or clinical outcomes, but did reduce the use of invasive coronary angiography.

Introduction
The optimal approach to investigating patients who present with stable chest pain remains controversial. The majority of such patients in
the UK are referred to a Rapid Access Chest Pain Clinic, which offers
clinical assessment in a secondary care setting within 2 weeks of referral. Options for further testing have traditionally either assessed
the coronary arteries for evidence of atheroma or used stress techniques to reveal reversible myocardial ischaemia.1 The role of invasive
assessment and treatment in patients with stable chest pain is controversial, especially after the recent ISCHEMIA trial2 found that coronary revascularization did not improve prognosis when added to
optimal medical therapy, despite its effectiveness in alleviating anginal
symptoms. The addition of intracoronary pressure wire data, such as
fractional flow reserve (FFR), to angiographic assessment has
improved the management of patients with stable chest pain in both
observational3-8 and randomized9-12 studies by identifying coronary
lesions that are physiologically significant, which is poorly predicted
by their angiographic appearance.13
The ideal test to assess patients with new onset chest pain might
therefore simultaneously provide information about the extent of
both coronary atheroma and myocardial ischaemia. Fractional flow

reserve derived from computed tomography coronary angiography
(FFRCT) is a well validated test14-18 that provides information about
both the coronary atheroma burden, from a computed tomography coronary angiogram (CTCA), and assesses their functional
importance using a computerized model of fluid dynamics based
on the CTCA dataset.14 FFRCT alters decision-making and patient
management compared with CTCA data alone,19 and observational
clinical studies, such as PLATFORM20 and ADVANCE,21 have demonstrated that the use of FFRCT can reduce the requirement for invasive coronary angiography, without increasing ischaemic clinical
events. Furthermore, the PLATFORM study suggested that the use
of CTCA with FFRCT reduces costs in the patients who would
have undergone invasive coronary angiography, and is cost neutral
in patients who would have had a non-invasive test.22 The UK
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in 201723
recommended that CTCA with FFRCT be considered as a frontline
test in patients with chest pain with the expectation of large cost
savings.
The FORECAST trial was designed to test the hypothesis that, in a
population of patients presenting to a Rapid Access Chest Pain Clinic,
a strategy of using CTCA with selective FFRCT would reduce total
cardiac resource utilization and costs at 9 months, when compared

with the standard clinical pathways based on NICE guidance.24 The
secondary aims were to assess the effect of the experimental strategy
on quality of life, angina status, subsequent clinical events, and the
rate of invasive coronary angiography.

Methods
Trial design and oversight

Patient population
All screened patients were at least 18 years old and were attending a
Rapid Access Chest Pain Clinic for assessment of stable chest pain. A full
list of exclusion criteria is available in the trial protocol (Supplementary
material online, Appendix SA). In brief, patients were excluded if they had
a history consistent with acute coronary syndrome, were deemed not to
require a test to investigate their symptoms, were ineligible to undergo a
CTCA, had a history of previous coronary revascularization, or had a life
expectancy of <12 months.

Randomization groups
Patients were randomized, using an independent computerized system
with block sizes of two and four, to either the usual care strategy based
on clinical pathways (standard group) or a strategy of CTCA with selective FFRCT (experimental group). In the standard group, patients were
assessed according to usual clinical care pathways at the Rapid Access
Chest Pain Clinic, based upon the local implementation of the NICE
CG95 Guidance for Chest Pain of Recent Onset.24 In these pathways,
patients with a high pre-test likelihood of having important coronary disease could be referred for invasive coronary angiography, while patients
with intermediate pre-test likelihood were referred for non-invasive
evaluation, which could include stress testing (i.e. stress echocardiography, stress cardiac magnetic resonance, nuclear medicine perfusion
imaging, and exercise electrocardiography), and CTCA (without FFRCT).
In the experimental group, all patients were referred for CTCA as the initial test and selectively referred for FFRCT if the CTCA demonstrated a
stenosis of >_40% in a coronary artery segment of diameter suitable for
revascularization by either a coronary stent or coronary artery bypass
graft surgery. Prior to randomization, the clinical team declared which initial test would be used in the event the patient was randomized to standard care. Subsequent clinical management was determined by the
supervising physician based on the results of initial testing and clinical
judgement.

Trial endpoints
The primary endpoint was cardiovascular costs over 9 months of followup, calculated from the use of all cardiac-related invasive and non-invasive

FORECAST was an open-label, multicentre, randomized, controlled clinical trial. The rationale and design have previously been described,25 and
the trial protocol is available in Supplementary material online, Appendix
SA. The trial complies with the Declaration of Helsinki, was approved by
the South Central Berkshire B Research Ethics Service Committee (REC
Reference 18/SC/0490, IRAS Project ID: 231037) and is registered at
ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03187639). The trial was investigator-initiated
and funded by an unrestricted research grant from HeartFlowV. The
company had no role in the design or conduct of the trial, or in the data
collection, analysis, or reporting. The trial steering committee oversaw
the conduct of the trial, ensuring that: (i) it was conducted in a manner
consistent with the protocol, (ii) the data were complete, and (iii) the
analyses were performed according to the Statistical Analysis Plan.

.. tests, revascularization procedures, hospital admissions and outpatient
..
.. attendances due to a cardiovascular cause [including myocardial infarc.. tion (MI), arrhythmia, heart failure, revascularization], and cardiac medica..
.. tions. Data were collected using direct patient contact by research staff at
.. each centre, as well as from local healthcare records. The total costs
..
.. were calculated for each patient as the sum, over all specified resources,
.. of the numbers of each resource used multiplied by a standardized cost
..
.. weight (the UK tariffs, listed in the Supplementary material online,
.. Appendix SB).
..
The two principal secondary endpoints were the changes in (i) quality
..
.. of life, as assessed using the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire26 and (ii) angina sta..
.. tus, as assessed using the Seattle Angina Questionnaire,27 which were
.. completed at baseline and 9 months of follow-up. The other pre-specified
.. secondary endpoints at 9 months of follow-up included major adverse
..
.. cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE), a composite of all-cause
.. death, non-fatal MI, stroke, and cardiovascular hospitalization; the rate of
..
.. invasive coronary angiography; and the rate of invasive angiography show.. ing unobstructed coronaries (no stenosis of >_50%).
..
..
.. Statistical analysis
..
.. The sample size calculation and statistical analysis plan have been
.. described in detail previously.25 Cost differences of 20% between the
..
.. randomized groups were taken to be plausible and of importance for pol.. icy setting, since the PLATFORM economic substudy reported a 32%
..
.. change in per-patient costs within the invasive stratum and 25% change
.. within the non-invasive stratum.22 Based on the cost distributions in
.. PLATFORM, we calculated that a sample size of 700 patients per group
..
.. would provide 90% power to detect a 20% difference in costs between
.. groups if there was no loss to follow-up, and 85% power with a loss to
..
.. follow-up of up to 12%.
..
The Statistical Analysis Plan for the trial data was determined in ad..
.. vance (Supplementary material online, Appendix SC), conforms to the
.. International Conference on Harmonization E9 guidelines, and is
..
.. reported using the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials
.. (CONSORT) guidelines. Categorical data are presented as counts and
..
.. percentages, and continuous variables are presented as means and stand.. ard deviations, and medians and interquartile ranges. The analysis of the
..
was based on the frequency of the events and
.. binary clinical outcomes
.. conducted using v2 tests. The primary endpoint was compared using a
.. two-sample t-test after a log transformation due to skew in the cost data.
..
.. Confidence limits on mean costs were calculated by bootstrapping. A
.. two-sided P-value of 0.05 or less was considered to constitute statistical
..
.. significance for all analyses. All analyses of outcome data were conducted
.. using an intention-to-treat framework.
..

..
.. Results
..
.. Between December 2017 and July 2019, 2494 patients with stable

patients who had FFRCT performed, 126 patients (59%) had at least
one epicardial vessel with an FFRCT <_ 0.8, which led to requests for
invasive angiography in 98 patients, a non-invasive stress test in 16
patients, and no further testing in 12 patients. Invasive angiography

was performed more often in patients with lower levels of FFRCT: in
26 of 29 patients (90%) with an FFRCT between 0.50 and 0.60, in 23
of 23 patients (100%) with an FFRCT between 0.61 and 0.70, in 39 of
56 patients (70%) with an FFRCT between 0.71 and 0.80, and in 4 of
94 patients (4%) with an FFRCT >0.80. The FFRCT value was not
recorded in 18 patients (although it is known that the value was
<0.80), invasive angiography was performed in 14 (78%) of these
patients.

Tests and revascularization procedure at
9 months
Over 9 months of follow-up, fewer stress tests were performed at
the discretion of the supervising physician in the experimental group
than in the standard group (60 vs. 95, Table 3). The use of invasive
coronary angiography was 22% lower in the experimental group
(Table 3): 136 patients vs. 175 patients in standard care strategy
(P = 0.01). The number of invasive angiograms showing no obstructive epicardial lesion was 52% lower in the experimental group: 30
patients vs. 62 patients in the standard care strategy. The use of invasive pressure wire assessment was also lower in the experimental
group: 18 patients vs. 28 patients (P = 0.18).
The overall rate of coronary revascularization did not differ significantly between the groups: 15% in the experimental group vs. 14% in
the standard group (P = 0.69). A total of 88 percutaneous coronary
intervention (PCI) procedures were undertaken in 74 patients (11%)
in the experimental group, compared with 75 PCIs in 69 patients

(10%) in the standard group, with 28 patients in each group undergoing CABG surgery (Table 3). In the experimental group, 90 of the
102 patients who underwent coronary revascularization had a functional study (a stress test or FFR), compared with 49 of the 97
patients who underwent coronary revascularization in the standard
group (P < 0.001).

Primary endpoint: total cardiac costs at
9 months
The mean total cardiac costs at 9 months were slightly higher in the
experimental group (lb1605) than in the standard group (lb1491)
[mean difference lb114 (8%), 95% confidence interval of -lb112 (-8%)
to thlb337 (th23%)], though the difference in mean costs was not significant (P = 0.10). The distribution of costs (Figure 2) was skewed upward by a minority of patients with high costs, such that the median
costs were lb70 lower in the experimental group than the standard
group (lb600 vs. lb670).
The pattern of non-invasive test use varied significantly (by design)
between the two randomized groups (Table 3), and while there was
significantly lower use of invasive coronary angiography in the experimental group, the number of hospitalizations, visits to outpatient clinics and emergency departments, and medication use did not differ
significantly (Table 3).

Major adverse cardiac and
cerebrovascular events at 9 months
The overall rate of MACCE (including death, non-fatal MI, non-fatal
stroke, cardiovascular hospitalization) was 71 (10.2%) in the experimental group vs. 74 (10.6%) in the standard group (P = 0.80).
Individual components of MACCE did not differ significantly between
groups (Table 4). There were two deaths in the experimental group
due to non-cardiac causes (metastatic cancer and progressive lung
fibrosis).

a low-risk population attending a Rapid Access Chest Pain Clinic,
there was no significant difference in cost over 9 months between
the experimental strategy and the standard strategy. Furthermore,
there were no significant differences in symptoms, quality of life,
MACCE, or use of coronary revascularization between the randomized groups. However, the experimental strategy led to a significant,
22% reduction in invasive coronary angiography, with 52% fewer
patients having no significant obstructive coronary artery disease on
invasive angiography .
FORECAST was designed using cost as the primary endpoint because we anticipated, based upon previous observational studies, that
clinical outcomes would be similar in a well-managed population of
stable patients with chest pain, irrespective of the initial testing strategy. We hypothesized that a strategy based on initial CTCA with selective FFRCT would be more efficient, with lower resource use and
cost. In 2017, the UK Medical Technologies Guidance on FFRCT23
predicted substantial cost savings for the National Health Service
with the adoption of CTCA with FFRCT. Economic analysis of the observational PLATFORM study had shown cost savings from the use
of FFRCT when an invasive approach was planned, and cost neutrality
when a non-invasive approach was planned.22 In FORECAST, we formally tested the hypothesis that there would be a meaningful cost
saving from the experimental strategy based on FFRCT, but found no
significant difference overall in costs compared with the standard
care strategy. This negative result for the primary outcome might be
due to the low prevalence of planned initial invasive angiography (7%
of the trial population), and the high prevalence of CTCA as the
planned initial test (65% of the trial population). This shift in standard
practice in the UK towards routine CTCA, which was stimualted by
the NICE CG95 Guidance on Chest Pain of Recent Onset, may have
limited the cost savings potential of the experimental strategy based
on initial CTCA and selective FFRCT.
Previous studies have consistently shown that the major benefit of
FFRCT has been to reduce the use of invasive coronary angiography,
particularly angiograms showing no obstructed coronary arteries. In
the observational PLATFORM study, invasive angiography was
reduced by 61% in the FFRCT cohort, and the clinical event rates at 1
year were equally low in both groups.28 The ADVANCE Registry of
patients having CTCA and FFRCT in routine clinical practice found unobstructed coronaries at invasive angiography in 14% of patients with
FFRCT <_0.8, compared with 44% of patients with FFRCT >0.8.21 In
addition, there were no deaths or MIs within 90 days in the 1529

strategy in FORECAST would result in less invasive angiography, and
no difference in clinical event rates, compared with standard clinical
pathways. The results of FORECAST have confirmed these expectations, with equivalent rates of clinical events, 22% fewer invasive

angiograms, and half the rate of unobstructed coronary arteries at invasive angiography in the experimental group, and are consistent
with the previous observational studies.
In FORECAST, quality of life and angina status improved to a similar degree in both groups by 9 months of follow-up. This result is consistent with the 1-year data from PLATFORM, in which the five-item
EuroQOL score did not differ significantly between the groups overall.28 The improvements seen in both groups are likely due to clinicians actively treating all subjects to relieve anginal symptoms,
resulting in the similar use of anti-anginal medications and similar
rates of coronary revascularization (Table 3). From a patient's perspective, achieving similar quality of life and angina outcomes with
fewer invasive procedures represents a potential advantage for the
experimental strategy based on FFRCT.
There are some limitations of FORECAST. First, and most important, is that we could not anticipate the precise rate of use of CTCA in
the standard group. The national guidelines were revised during planning of the trial, and while they recommended that CTCA become
the default test for most patients attending Rapid Access Chest Pain
Clinics, the infrastructure in many areas of the National Health
Service at that time could not provide the test. The subsequent major
expansion in CT facilities greatly improved access to CTCA in the
last few years. The FORECAST trial, however, was based upon a
pragmatic design: the experimental strategy (CTCA with selective
FFRCT) vs. standard clinical care pathways, whatever tests that should
include. With almost two-thirds of patients in the standard group
having planned initial CTCA, the contrast between the randomized
groups in FORECAST was diminished, along with the potential for
cost savings with the experimental strategy based on the use of
CTCA with selective FFRCT. A recent individual-based Markov
microsimulation model for patients with low-risk stable chest pain,
based upon the PROMISE population, suggested that an anatomical
approach using CTCA was cost-effective compared with functional
testing.29
A second limitation of the trial is that the costs in this study were
based on UK National Health Service cost tariffs, and may not be generalizable to other countries with different cost structures in their
health delivery systems. In an attempt to address this, one pre-specified sensitivity analysis for this trial is to apply US-specific cost tariffs

to the FORECAST data, and this is the subject of ongoing analysis.
Third, we used cardiac costs, rather than total medical costs, as the
primary endpoint. Cardiac costs are more likely to be affected by the
alternative strategies and were simpler for the local research teams
to document. While it seems unlikely that non-cardiac costs would
be affected by the management strategies tested, we cannot exclude
the possibility that total medical costs differed, even though the cardiac costs did not.
The significant reduction in death from coronary heart disease and
non-fatal MI seen at 5 years in the SCOT-HEART trial30 in the cohort
undergoing CTCA, compared with routine care alone, indicates that
there is considerable prognostic benefit from identifying coronary
atheroma and initiating optimal medical therapy based on CTCA findings. Indeed, the results of FORECAST raise an important question
that the trial cannot answer: namely, what is the optimal use of FFRCT
in routine clinical practice when CTCA is the default approach? In
light of the findings from SCOT-HEART30 and ISCHEMIA,2 one could
speculate that, rather than using FFRCT based on the burden of atheroma found on CTCA, FFRCT analysis could be reserved only for
patients with insufficient symptomatic response to optimal medical
therapy in whom revascularization is therefore being considered.
This approach would be consistent with a sub-analysis of the
PROMISE trial31 that demonstrated the value of describing degrees
of coronary atheroma by CTCA in patients presenting with suspected angina, even in the absence of any functional testing for ischaemia, for predicting the primary endpoint of death, MI, and
hospitalization for unstable angina. This suggests that the optimal application of FFRCT in the setting of stable symptoms may be after optimal medical therapy fails to control angina adequately, at which time
FFRCT could be performed using the previously collected CTCA
dataset, and thereby assess the need for revascularization as part of a
shared decision-making process with the patient.
In conclusion, the experimental strategy of initial CTCA with selective FFRCT in patients presenting with stable angina did not significantly reduce costs compared with standard clinical evaluation
pathways, and led to similar clinical outcomes, including major adverse cardiovascular events, anginal symptoms, and quality of life. The
experimental strategy based on FFRCT did, however, reduce the use
