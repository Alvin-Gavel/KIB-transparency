Aims

The term idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (IVF) describes survivors of unexplained cardiac arrest (UCA) without a
specific diagnosis after clinical and genetic testing. Previous reports have described a subset of IVF individuals with
ventricular arrhythmia initiated by short-coupled trigger premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) for which the
term short-coupled ventricular fibrillation (SCVF) has been proposed. The aim of this article is to establish the
phenotype and frequency of SCVF in a large cohort of UCA survivors.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
We performed a multicentre study including consecutive UCA survivors from the CASPER registry. Short-coupled venand results
tricular fibrillation was defined as otherwise unexplained ventricular fibrillation initiated by a trigger PVC with a coupling

interval of <350 ms. Among 364 UCA survivors, 24/364 (6.6%) met diagnostic criteria for SCVF. The diagnosis of SCVF
was obtained in 19/24 (79%) individuals by documented ventricular fibrillation during follow-up. Ventricular arrhythmia
was initiated by a mean PVC coupling interval of 274 +/- 32 ms. Electrical storm occurred in 21% of SCVF probands but not
in any UCA proband (P < 0.001). The median time to recurrent ventricular arrhythmia in SCVF was 31 months. Recurrent
ventricular fibrillation resulted in quinidine administration in 12/24 SCVF (50%) with excellent arrhythmia control.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
Short-coupled ventricular fibrillation is a distinct primary arrhythmia syndrome accounting for at least 6.6% of
UCA. As documentation of ventricular fibrillation onset is necessary for the diagnosis, most cases are diagnosed at
the time of recurrent arrhythmia, thus the true prevalence of SCVF remains still unknown. Quinidine is effective in
SCVF and should be considered as first-line treatment for patients with recurrent episodes.

of life-threatening conditions in younger (<45 years) individuals with
cardiac arrest.1 Previous studies have demonstrated that a significant
proportion of UCA/SUD events are related to previously undiagnosed inherited arrhythmia conditions.1,2 Use of a comprehensive

Methods
Study population
The present study is a substudy from the CASPER (Cardiac Arrest
Survivors With Preserved Ejection Fraction Registry) registry, which is a
national, multicentre registry enrolling since January 2004 UCA survivors
and their 1st-degree family members as well as 1st-degree relatives of
SUD victims with negative autopsy and toxicology screening.3,13 A
detailed description of the protocol and eligibility criteria has been published previously (see also Supplementary material online, Table S1).3
Standardized, guideline-derived diagnostic criteria for known inherited
arrhythmia syndromes and genetic cardiomyopathies were applied as
previously published by our group (Supplementary material online,
Table S2).14
For the present study, we included probands with a history of resuscitated cardiac arrest and working diagnosis IVF/UCA after comprehensive
stepwise clinical assessment and negative or inconclusive genetic testing
(Figure 1). Eligible individuals were enrolled from January 2004 until
September 2019. All individuals with recurrent VF/polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) at any point during follow-up were eligible. For UCA
patients without recurrent ventricular arrhythmia, a minimal follow-up of
12 months was recommended to increase the sensitivity for late arrhythmic events. Written informed consent was obtained from all study subjects, and the study protocol was approved by the local research ethics
board of each participating centre.

Definition of short-coupled ventricular
fibrillation
We propose the term SCVF for this distinct phenotype. To distinguish
this particular condition from other primary electrical disorders and reversible conditions associated with spontaneous polymorphic VT/VF, we
sought to determine clinical and electrophysiological features unique for
this particular condition. The coupling interval of trigger PVCs in confounding conditions such as hereditary long-QT syndrome, (post)-ischaemia-related VF, or pause-dependent torsade de pointes is typically at
least at 490-514 ms.15,16 We defined the coupling interval of the trigger
PVCs as the interval between the QRS onset of the preceding conducted
sinus beat and the QRS onset of the PVC initiating VF/polymorphic VT.
Assuming a normal distribution of the spontaneous variation in coupling
intervals for these conditions, we analysed the upper coupling limit of
SCVF trigger PVCs to define a cut-off value that (i) would be separated
by >_ 2 standard deviations (excluding 95% of potentially confounding differential conditions), and (ii) represent the 95% percentile of all SCVF
cases. Based on these requirements and the results of our observations
(see Results section), we propose a definition of SCVF requiring all of the
following:
(1)

documentation of VF or polymorphic VT initiated by a PVC with a
coupling interval of < 350 ms;
absence of QTc prolongation according to current definitions5;
absence of pause-dependent torsade de pointes [preceding R-R
interval prior to the trigger PVC >1500 ms in individuals without
pacemaker/implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) or >1300
ms in individuals with pacemaker/ICD] following a stable baseline
rhythm.15 However, initiation of ventricular arrhythmia by shortlong-short cycles (R-R cycles <1300 ms) with short-coupled trigger
PVCs was eligible as described previously for Brugada syndrome
and early repolarization syndrome17;
absence of type 1 Brugada pattern (spontaneous or inducible), early
repolarization pattern or short-QT according to current definitions
and guidelines at the index cardiac arrest or during follow-up5,18,19;
absence of catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia
(CPVT) according to current definitions14;
absence of structural heart disease (no active ischaemia or coronary
artery disease with >50% stenosis, no left ventricular ejection fraction <50%) or other primary electrical disorder or arrhythmogenic
cardiomyopathy as previously defined3;
absence of reversible metabolic or pharmacological/toxicological
conditions that may cause similar electrophysiological findings.

Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator
interrogations
Appropriate and inappropriate ICD therapies were independently
assessed and ICD-recorded episodes of SCVF were only accepted
if complete interrogation data including tracings of the event-related
intracardiac
electrogram
were
available.
In
addition,
diagnostic electrocardiogram (ECG) or telemetry tracings of corresponding arrhythmic events were also included where available. All ICD
tracings and available ECG/telemetry tracings were reviewed and reclassified by an experienced electrophysiologist (C.S.). There was no VF/VT
undersensing in any of the analysed ICD tracings.

Cardiac investigations
All study subjects underwent extensive comprehensive cardiac testing to
screen for structural heart disease or inherited arrhythmia syndromes
using a stepwise systematic approach as previously reported (Supplementary material online, Figure S1).3 After elimination of coronary artery

syndrome or short-QT syndrome prior to their characterization.4
Current guidelines define IVF as 'a resuscitated cardiac arrest victim,
preferably with documentation of VF, in whom known cardiac, respiratory, metabolic and toxicological etiologies have been excluded
through clinical evaluation'.5
However, over the past 30-35 years, a specific subtype of IVF has
been described that is typically initiated by short-coupled trigger premature ventricular contractions (PVCs).6-9 There is now growing
evidence that this particular phenotype is actually a distinct electrical
entity for which we propose the term 'short-coupled ventricular fibrillation' (SCVF).6-12 Due to the lack of stringent terminology, the
terms IVF and SCVF are still often confounded and erroneously used
as synonyms in the literature. The first suspicion that SCVF may actually represent a distinct primary electrical disorder has been evoked
in the early 1990s when the concept of VF with short-coupled trigger
PVCs was first reported.7-9 However, there is still no standardized
definition of SCVF distinguishing this particular arrhythmia from other
primary arrhythmia syndromes with similar findings such as early
repolarization syndrome or short-QT syndrome that have subsequently emerged and may have contaminated historical cohorts of
patients with unexplained VF.
We hypothesized that SCVF represents a distinct primary electrical disease. Data about the proportion, in-depth characterization, and
optimal treatment of SCVF in contemporary cohorts of UCA are
limited.
The aim of this study was to assess the overall prevalence of SCVF
in a large cohort of UCA survivors and to provide in-depth standardized clinical and genetic characterization of affected patients. We
also propose standardized criteria to facilitate the diagnostic approach to this particular condition.

disease by coronary angiography or cardiac computed tomography, basic
cardiac workup included a detailed personal history and family history
with a three-generation pedigree, repeat resting ECGs with standard and
high precordial leads, symptom-limited exercise treadmill testing, ambulatory Holter monitoring, signal-averaged ECG, and transthoracic echocardiogram. Interpretation of electrocardiographic exams was performed
according to guideline-derived criteria as previously described.20 Cardiac
magnetic resonance imaging was performed in most individuals, and
pharmacological provocation with procainamide or epinephrine was performed in selected patients based on clinical suspicion and physician
preference.

All SCVF patients underwent whole exome sequencing (WES) that was
performed by a commercial laboratory (Blueprint Genetics, Espoo,
Finland) or a research laboratory (Montreal Heart Institute, Montreal,
Canada), targeting a mean coverage of 100. Sequencing platforms used
for this study included the Illumina HiSeq2000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA,
USA) and the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA,
USA). Analysis was performed using a virtual panel of genes previously
implicated in cardiac arrhythmias and/or cardiomyopathies. With regard
to the DPP6 gene, complete sequencing of all exons and exon-intron
boundaries was performed by no haplotype analysis. Exon capture was
performed using the Roche NimbleGen SeqCap EZ kit (Roche, Madison,
WI, USA) (along with the HiSeq200) and SeqCap EZ MedExome kit
(Roche, Madison, WI, USA) (along with the NovaSeq 6000).
Variant analysis was performed using the genome analysis toolkit
(GATK) (Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA, USA) and in-house scripts as
reported previously.21 Variant analysis was subsequently limited to 196
pre-specified genes (Supplementary material online, Table S3). Unlimited
WES analysis was performed by a commercial laboratory in 4/24 SCVF
individuals (17%). As this approach was previously not available for clinical
diagnostic purposes, it was only performed in the four most recently diagnosed SCVF patients.
Genetic variants were classified according to current guidelines.22
Additional tools used for variant interpretation included freely available
online tools such as VarSome and ClinVar.22-25 In silico prediction
was performed using the SIFT, PolyPhen-2, and MUTTASTER-2 software.26-29

Diagnostic strength
All clinical diagnoses were re-evaluated at the time of study follow-up
and revised on the basis of clinical events during follow-up, or new evidence from repeated clinical or genetic testing. Based on the weight of
clinical and genetic evidence, the working diagnosis was further classified
using a qualitative descriptor of a previously described categorization of
strength of the diagnosis as definite, probable, and possible (Supplementary material online, Table S2).3,14,20

Statistical analysis
Continuous variables are expressed as mean +/- standard deviation, or as
median and interquartile range (IQR) where appropriate. Categorical variables are expressed as absolute number and percentage and analysed
using v2 test and Fisher's exact test. Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney U
test was performed for continuous variables with independent measures
where appropriate. Time-to-event analysis comparing survival free from
recurrent VF between SCVF and UCA patients was performed using
Kaplan-Meier function and log-rank test. To assess the effect of quinidine
on VF recurrence in SCVF, a modified Kaplan-Meier method was used

Coupling threshold of premature
ventricular contraction triggers in shortcoupled ventricular fibrillation
All episodes of ventricular arrhythmia occurred either at rest/sleep
or in a non-adrenergic state. The preceding rhythm was sinus rhythm
in all individuals, and the median ambient heart rate preceding the
ventricular arrhythmia was 78 b.p.m. in SCVF (IQR 11 b.p.m.). None
of the SCVF-related episodes was pause-dependent, i.e. initiated after
a prolonged R-R interval >1500 ms following a stable baseline
rhythm. However, in a few patients, SCVF was initiated after short-
long-short R-R sequences (Figure 2B) that occurred during periods
of frequent ventricular ectopy. The coupling intervals of PVC triggers
in SCVF probands were compared with the trigger PVCs of patients
with known long-QT syndrome, arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy
and UCA probands from the CASPER registry. Recurrent VF in the
latter was typically initiated by long-coupled trigger PVCs
(501 +/- 74 ms) (P < 0.001), which is consistent with previous
reports.15,16 According to our pre-specified cut-off criteria, the upper
coupling limit for SCVF trigger PVCs was expected to be at 352 ms.
Table 3 shows electrophysiological characteristics of the documented ventricular arrhythmia in SCVF. The mean cycle length of
SCVF was 217 +/- 65 ms, and the mean coupling interval of the trigger
PVC was 274 +/- 31 ms (range 234-350 ms) (Figure 4A). Histogram distribution of the coupling interval of the trigger PVCs and the corresponding z-score are shown in Figure 4B and Supplementary material
online, Figure S2. The 90%, 93%, and 95% percentile of the coupling
interval in our SCVF cohort were 319 ms [95% CI 290-350 ms],
328 ms [95% CI 300-350], and 343 ms [95% CI 300-350],

..
.. respectively. Only 4/24 individuals (16.6%) had a documented trigger

of only 240 ms. (B) Telemetry tracings of continuous rhythm strips of a 48-year-old female patient with short-coupled ventricular fibrillation who

SCVF patients with electrical storm the day of their index cardiac arrest, the median time to recurrent ventricular arrhythmia was
30.6 months (8.6, 70.7; range 0.3-124) in SCVF patients compared
with 51.2 months (25.4, 96.3; range 0.9-559) in UCA probands.

During follow-up, 12/24 individuals with SCVF (50%) were placed
on quinidine (average daily dose 667 +/- 400 mg) for recurrent VF.
Patients receiving quinidine were typically individuals with multiple
appropriate ICD shocks or those who had experienced electrical

fibrillation that occurred at rest and was initiated by a trigger premature ventricular contraction with an extremely short coupling interval of 260 ms
(red arrow). The ambient heart rate was 76 b.p.m. (B) A 53-year-old female patient with unexplained cardiac arrest and no evidence of structural
heart disease. The patient experienced recurrent ventricular fibrillation only 48 h after implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implantation.
Ventricular fibrillation was initiated by a short-coupled premature ventricular contraction [coupling interval of 253 ms (red arrow)] and successfully
terminated by an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shock. The upper tracing shows a run of non-sustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia
that occurred several minutes before the sustained ventricular fibrillation episode (lower tracing). Similar runs of polymorphic non-sustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia were recorded since hospital admission and prior to implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implantation. Coupling
intervals of trigger premature ventricular contractions were typically between 250 and 265 ms. The patient was put on quinidine and had no further
ventricular fibrillation recurrence.

65.5 months (19.5, 138) on quinidine, VF recurrence with appropriate
ICD therapy occurred in 2/12 (16.6%) SCVF patients. The mean time
to recurrent VF on quinidine therapy was 43.8 +/- 18.5 months.
Interestingly, the two SCVF patients with recurrent VF on quinidine
had daily doses of <300 mg.

Genetic findings
All individuals underwent WES and subsequent analyses were
restricted to 196 pre-specified genes (Supplementary material online,
Table S4). Results of genetic testing are shown in Table 4. Whole
exome sequencing did not reveal a pathogenic or likely pathogenic
variant in any SCVF proband that could explain the phenotype. A
total of 10 variants of unknown significance were found in 7/24 SCVF
probands but not in individuals with UCA (Table 4).
Based on our genetic analyses, we did not detect a robust genetic
substrate to explain the SCVF phenotype, and there was no evidence
of familial forms.

Discussion
The findings of the present study suggest that SCVF is a distinct primary electrical disease and an important cause of UCA/SUD (6.6% of
all CASPER apparently UCA survivors) (Graphical abstract).
Unlike other primary electrical diseases such as Brugada syndrome
or long-QT syndrome, SCVF does not exhibit distinct electrocardiographic findings, rendering the clinical diagnosis particularly challenging. A Japanese study reported an increased association of complete
right bundle branch block-after exclusion of Brugada syndrome-in
a cohort of patients with IVF, but this finding was completely absent
in the CASPER SCVF cohort.31 At present, the sole diagnostic criteria
for SCVF are the electrophysiological finding of VF initiation by a trigger PVC with a short coupling interval (<350 ms) in the absence of
type 1 Brugada or early repolarization pattern, prolonged QTc intervals, and preceding pause. A cut-off value of 350 ms included the 95%
percentile providing the most distinct upper limit inclusion criteria. A
similar cut-off value was used as inclusion criteria by Haissaguerre
et al.32 in a recent study of SCVF patients referred for ablation of VF
drivers. The fact that 84% of trigger PVCs of all arrhythmic episodes

The VF CL was estimated from the averaged VF rate as indicated on the

had a coupling interval of <300 ms and 100% of <_350 ms, demonstrates that short-coupled PVCs are the dominant trigger events
within a narrow window of coupling intervals. Considering the mean
coupling interval of trigger PVCs related to other inherited arrhythmia syndromes or VF episodes in undifferentiated UCA patients, our
observations and previous reports suggest that our proposed cut-off
value for SCVF would be separated by two standard deviations from
those conditions minimizing the chance of diagnostic overlap. In this
context, it should be mentioned that polymorphic VT/VF initiated by
relatively short-coupled trigger PVCs may also occur in individuals
with established coronary artery disease or myocardial inflammation.33-35 Two recent studies demonstrated short-coupled ventricular arrhythmia in patients with acute and chronic coronary artery
disease.34,35 Interestingly, the mean coupling interval of trigger PVCs
in both studies on coronary artery disease patients by Viskin et al.
was still much longer (376 +/- 49 and 364 +/- 36 ms, respectively) than
the mean coupling interval in our SCVF cohort (274 +/- 31).
Case series of IVF initiated by short-coupled PVCs were first
reported in the 1990s, but most likely described heterogeneous
study populations including early repolarization syndrome, short-QT
syndrome, and undiagnosed Brugada syndrome in addition to true
SCVF.8,9,12 The two largest of those previous studies reported coupling intervals of 245-300 ms, and the seminal study by Leenhardt et
al. introduced the term 'short-coupled torsade de pointes' to describe the electrophysiological hallmark of their findings, which we
believe is identical to SCVF.7,9 Given significant differences in pathophysiology, and to avoid future confusion with true long-QT syndrome or pause-dependent torsade de pointes, we propose to
prioritize the term SCVF.
Incidence and prevalence of SCVF are difficult to determine and
are most likely underestimated. As documentation of ventricular arrhythmia onset is essential for the diagnosis of SCVF, the true incidence may even be higher, and it is possible that more SCVF cases
will be identified among our UCA patients over time. The risk of recurrent VF seems to be elevated in SCVF. In our study, 92% of all
SCVF patients experienced recurrent VF; however, this may

represent an overestimation as VF recurrence is required for the majority of cases to establish the diagnosis of SCVF. Previous studies of
IVF have reported recurrence rates of 18-39% over similar follow-up
periods.36-39 In addition, 21% of our SCVF cohort experienced electrical storm (>_3 VF episodes in 24 h) documenting a particular severe
phenotype. Compared with similar inherited arrhythmia syndromes
such as early repolarization syndrome,11 our data suggest that the
risk of electrical storm seems to be even more pronounced in pure
SCVF.
The pathophysiology and molecular mechanisms of SCVF still remain largely elusive. Functional data and electroanatomic mapping
studies suggest a crucial role of the His-Purkinje system for the initiation of trigger PVCs.10,11,40 The proarrhythmogenic role of Purkinje
fibres seems to be linked to an (increased) activity of the Purkinje
fibre-Ito channel resulting in short-coupled trigger PVCs.40 Further
support for the role of abnormal Ito function comes from the observation that quinidine, a strong Ito inhibitor, is highly effective in
SCVF.41 Although abnormal Purkinje fibre firing is implicated in the
pathogenesis, this mechanism is not exclusive for SCVF but has also
been observed in Brugada syndrome and early repolarization
syndrome.32,42
The lack of a conclusive genetic substrate in our SCVF cohort is
consistent with previous reports suggesting that the vast majority of
SCVF cases do not follow a classic Mendelian inheritance pattern.43

pathogenic CASQ2 mutation (c.1185delC; p.D395Ef22) affecting
exon 11 of CASQ2. The mutation is rare and has not been observed
in gnomAD. However, we do not believe that this CASQ2 variant is
related to the patient's SCVF phenotype. Exercise treadmill testing
did not reveal any signs of a CPVT phenotype, and there are no segregation or functional data available. Transmission of CASQ2-related
CPVT is usually autosomal recessive, but isolated cases of autosomal
dominant forms of CPVT have been described for certain CASQ2
variants.44,45 Another female SCVF patient was found to be heterozygous for a TRPM4 missense variant (c.3170A>G; pY1057C). The
variant is rare, and there is only one heterozygous individual with the
same variant in gnomAD. Three different in silico tools suggested a
disease-causing effect. Genetic variants of TRPM4 have been typically
linked to familial forms of cardiac conduction disease, but an isolated
case of IVF has also been reported.46 The patient in question did not
show any signs of cardiac conduction disease, and in the absence of
functional data or familial segregation of the TRPM4 variant has to be
classified as a variant of unknown significance at this point.
A monogenic subset of hereditary SCVF has been described in the
Netherlands and is related to a risk haplotype affecting the noncoding
region of the dipeptidyl-aminopeptidase-like protein 6 (DPP6) gene
(c.1-340C>T).47 This DPP6 risk haplotype represents a Dutch founder mutation and has not been described outside the Netherlands to
date.38,48 The Dutch DPP6 haplotype is characterized by a very aggressive phenotype with increased risk of recurrent SCVF, and high

penetrance including late onset even after the age of 70.38,48,49
Functional studies showed that the Dutch risk haplotype results in
DPP6 overexpression that subsequently increases the activity of the
Purkinje fibre-Ito channel.40,47 Other reports of rare, monogenetic
forms of IVF are limited to isolated families or case reports and have
described variants in RyR2, CALM1, IRX3, or coding mutations of
DPP6.50-53 No pathogenic or likely pathogenic DPP6 variant was
detected in our SCVF cohort, but we did not perform a DPP6 haplotype analysis. Of note, site investigators are aware of the DPP6 entity
and typically inquire regarding country of origin in northern
European Caucasian patients with SCVF. Unfortunately, this data
point was not captured in the registry. At this point, the genetic
mechanisms underlying the majority of SCVF cases are largely speculative. Alternative genetic substrates may include mutations of deep
intronic regions or SCVF may be linked to oligo- or polygenic causes.
From a pathophysiological perspective, SCVF shows remarkable
overlapping features with Brugada syndrome, early repolarization
syndrome, and to some extent with short-QT syndrome.6 Common
features include arrhythmia onset during phases of increased vagal
tone (sleep, rest), the aforementioned role of Purkinje fibres for
arrhythmogenesis, trigger PVCs with short coupling interval and the
response to quinidine.41 All SCVF patients in our study experienced
cardiac arrest or recurrent VF at rest or during sleep.
Like in Brugada syndrome, early repolarization syndrome or shortQT syndrome,30,54,55 quinidine-a potent Ito inhibitor-represents
the only effective pharmacological therapy in SCVF.54 In our study,
83% of SCVF patients had no further VF recurrence on quinidine,
while 17% had recurrent ventricular arrhythmia over time with a
mean delay of 43.8 +/- 18.5 months after quinidine introduction.
Despite this recurrence, rate hazards for recurrent VF remained

effect of quinidine on ventricular fibrillation recurrence in shortcoupled ventricular fibrillation, a modified Kaplan-Meier method
was used estimating the cumulative hazard rates of events according
to the presence or absence of quinidine (conditional Poisson distribution). The duration of follow-up on quinidine was defined as the
observation on-therapy and the period before starting quinidine as
the observation time off-therapy with patients serving as their own

studies describing this distinct arrhythmia syndrome.7,9,12,37 Also, the
small number of ascertained SCVF cases may not reflect the complete clinical spectrum of this novel arrhythmia syndrome.
Compared with all previous studies, we suggest standardized diagnostic criteria to provide an increased degree of diagnostic certainty.
Using these robust criteria, it is unlikely that our SCVF cohort may
have been contaminated by undiagnosed forms of Brugada syndrome
or early repolarization syndrome. The necessity of documented VF
onset for the diagnosis of SCVF inevitably introduces bias and may
overestimate the true incidence of VF recurrence as SCVF patients
without recurrent VF, electrical storm or frequent non-sustained VT/
VF remain likely undiagnosed. The potential concern of single-observer bias during the blinded analysis of ICD tracings was counterbalanced by the use of the automated measures of the coupling intervals
as indicated by the device.
Despite broad genetic testing, we did not identify a genetic substrate related to SCVF. Additional genetic methods including haplotype analysis or unrestricted gene-searching WES or whole-genome
sequencing analysis may be useful to reveal the genetic basis of SCVF
but were not performed in the present study.

Conclusions
Short-coupled ventricular fibrillation likely represents a distinct arrhythmia syndrome accounting for at least 6.6% of UCA in otherwise
healthy individuals. The clinical diagnosis is challenging, given the absence of a distinct electrocardiographic signature and lack of a genetic
substrate. Quinidine is highly effective in SCVF and should be considered as first-line therapy in patients with recurrent VF episodes or
frequent appropriate ICD therapies.
