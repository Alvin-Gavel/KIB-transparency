Aims

The potential difference in the impacts of lifestyle factors (LFs) on progression from healthy to first cardiometabolic disease (FCMD), subsequently to cardiometabolic multimorbidity (CMM), and further to death is unclear.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
We used data from the China Kadoorie Biobank of 461 047 adults aged 30-79 free of heart disease, stroke, and
and results
diabetes at baseline. Cardiometabolic multimorbidity was defined as the coexistence of two or three CMDs,
including ischaemic heart disease (IHD), stroke, and type 2 diabetes (T2D). We used multi-state model to analyse
the impacts of high-risk LFs (current smoking or quitting because of illness, current excessive alcohol drinking or
quitting, poor diet, physical inactivity, and unhealthy body shape) on the progression of CMD. During a median
follow-up of 11.2 years, 87 687 participants developed at least one CMD, 14 164 developed CMM, and 17 541 died
afterwards. Five high-risk LFs played crucial but different roles in all transitions from healthy to FCMD, to CMM,
and then to death. The hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) per one-factor increase were 1.20 (1.19, 1.21) and
1.14 (1.11, 1.16) for transitions from healthy to FCMD, and from FCMD to CMM, and 1.21 (1.19, 1.23), 1.12 (1.10,
1.15), and 1.10 (1.06, 1.15) for mortality risk from healthy, FCMD, and CMM, respectively. When we further divided FCMDs into IHD, ischaemic stroke, haemorrhagic stroke, and T2D, we found that LFs played different roles in
disease-specific transitions even within the same transition stage.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
Assuming causality exists, our findings emphasize the significance of integrating comprehensive lifestyle interventions into both health management and CMD management.

Multimorbidity

Introduction
Multimorbidity is associated with reduced quality of life and greater
use of health-care resources. It is becoming a global health challenge.1
Cardiometabolic multimorbidity (CMM), one of the most replicable
multimorbidity profiles,2 is defined as the coexistence of two or three
cardiometabolic diseases (CMDs), including diabetes, ischaemic heart
disease (IHD), and stroke.3-7
Although the associations between lifestyle factors (LFs) and single
CMDs are well-established, a limited number of studies examined
the associations between LFs and CMM. A pooled analysis of 16
cohorts of 120 813 European and US adults showed that the odds
ratio [95% confidence interval (CI)] for CMM was 1.9 (1.8-2.3) per
5 kg/m2 higher body mass index (BMI) among CMD-free population.5
Another study conducted in Nurses' Health Study and Health
Professionals Follow-up Study revealed that the risk of cardiovascular
diseases for type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients with three or more lowrisk LFs was only half that for patients with 0 low-risk LFs.8 Generally,
prior studies either investigated the impact of LFs on the development of CMM in participants free of any CMD, regardless of the
intermediate progress of a single CMD,4,5,9 or on the prognosis of
patients with a single CMD or CMM.10 Although these studies

indicated positive effects of LFs, such fragmented analyses by only
focusing on one stage of disease progression make it challenging to
compare the impact of LFs on different stages before and after a single CMD.
Only one study examined the role of LFs in the progression of
CMM in a UK occupational cohort.4 Their results showed that LFs
had stronger effects on the transition from first CMD (FCMD) to
CMM than from CMD-free to FCMD. Whether such results apply to
other populations with different genetic and environmental backgrounds, merits further research. Additionally, the majority of studies
on LFs and CMM were conducted in the Western population in
which the proportion of haemorrhagic stroke (HS) among total
stroke is significantly lower than that in the Chinese population.11
Since the aetiological pathways and risk factors are not the same for
ischaemic stroke (IS) and HS,12 the effect estimates of the association
of LFs with CMM in the Chinese population may differ.
Therefore, we aimed to examine the associations of single and
combined LFs with FCMD, CMM, and death in the China Kadoorie
Biobank (CKB) of 0.5 million Chinese adults. Importantly, we used
multi-state model to investigate the potentially different impacts of
LFs on transitions from free of CMD to FCMD, subsequently to
CMM, and further to death. In line with previous studies,3-7 we

limited CMDs to IHD, stroke (including both IS and HS), and T2D.
Because of the large number of cases, we further examined the role
of LFs in all possible transitions between healthy and individual
CMDs, as well as individual CMDs to CMM and death.

Methods
Study design

Assessment of lifestyle factors and other
covariates
Lifestyle factors of interest were assessed by baseline questionnaires and
physical measurements. We asked the frequency, type, and amount of tobacco smoked per day for ever-smokers (former and current). Former
smokers were additionally asked about the years since quitting and the
reason for quitting. Questions about alcohol consumption included typical drinking frequency, type of alcoholic beverage consumed habitually,
and volume of alcohol consumed on a typical drinking day in the past
12 months. For physical activity, the usual type and duration of occupational, commuting, domestic, and leisure time-related activities in the past
12 months were collected. To calculate daily total physical activity level,
we multiplied the metabolic equivalent of tasks (METs) for each activity
by the hour spent on that activity and summed the MET-hours for all
activities.14 We assessed habitual intakes of 12 conventional food groups
in the past 12 months via a validated qualitative food frequency questionnaire (Supplementary material online, Table S1).15 Weight, height, and
waist circumference (WC) were measured by trained staff using wellcalibrated instruments. Body mass index was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in metres squared.
A range of covariates were also assessed by the baseline questionnaire,
including socio-demographic characteristics, personal and family medical
history, and female reproductive information. Participants who had at
least one parent suffering from chronic heart disease, stroke, or diabetes
were considered as having a CMD family history. Of those, participants
who reported at least one parent suffering from at least two of the
CMDs were considered as having a CMM family history. Prevalent hypertension was defined as measured systolic blood pressure >_140 mmHg,

measured diastolic blood pressure >_90 mmHg, a self-reported diagnosis
of hypertension, or antihypertensive medication use at baseline.

Definition of high-risk lifestyle factors
We considered five LFs, including smoking, alcohol drinking, dietary habit,
physical activity, and body shape according to previous studies.16,17 The
definitions for high-risk LFs were according to the data availability of our
study and the characteristics of the Chinese population. Their
associations with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and mortality are wellestablished in our population.15,18,19 Also, we did not consider clinical factors such as total cholesterol, blood pressure, and glucose, as included in
the well-known Life's Simple 7,20 because they are potential mediators
between LFs and CMDs.
For smoking, we assigned current smokers and former smokers who
quit because of illness to the high-risk group. For alcohol drinking, the
high-risk group was defined as those who drank >_30 g/day of pure alcohol
or having stopped drinking. Former smokers and drinkers were included
in the high-risk group to avoid a misleadingly elevated risk for the reference group. For physical activity, we defined the high-risk group as those
who engaged in a sex- and age- (<50, 50-59, and >_60 years) specific
lower half of total physical activity. According to the Chinese dietary
guidelines21 and previous findings in our population,22 we defined unhealthy dietary habits as non-daily eating of vegetables, fruits, and eggs,
and eating red meat daily or less than weekly. For body shape, both BMI
and WC were considered to reflect energy balance.20 Participants having
BMI <18.5 or >_28.0 kg/m2 or having WC >_90 cm (men)/85 cm (women)
were considered as high risk, which emphasized avoidance of extremely
high or low weight and abdominal obesity. The number of high-risk LFs
was counted, ranging from 0 to 5.

Follow-up for cardiometabolic disease and
death
Incident cases of interest and death were identified through linkages to
disease and mortality registries and national health insurance claim database, supplemented with local residential records and annual active confirmation. Causes of death were ascertained chiefly by death certificates
and supplemented by reviews of medical records and verbal autopsy
using validated instruments. All events were coded according to the
International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision by trained staff
blinded to baseline information.
In the present analysis, IHD, IS, and HS were defined by code I20 to
I25, I63, and I61. For T2D, after excluding cases with a definitive diagnosis
of insulin-dependent, malnutrition-related, or other specified diabetes
(E10, E12, and E13), we included cases coded as E11 or E14 in the analysis. Because participants in our study were aged mostly over 40 years at
baseline, it was reasonable to assume that incident cases of unspecified
diabetes (E14) were mostly T2D. Since 2014, medical records of incident
IHD and stroke cases were retrieved and reviewed by qualified cardiovascular specialists blinded to baseline exposures of patients. By October
2018, of 33 515 retrieved medical records of IHD cases and 40 465
retrieved medical records of stroke cases, the diagnosis was confirmed in
87.9% of IHD cases and 91.8% of stroke cases. The medical records of a
random sample of 831 diabetes cases were retrieved and reviewed, and
98.6% were confirmed for diagnosis. Therefore, we did not conduct further adjudication for diabetes.

Statistical methods
Participants were considered at risk from enrolment to death, loss to
follow-up, or 31 December 2017, whichever came first. Changes in

The CKB is a large-scale prospective cohort of 512 725 participants aged
30-79 years from five urban and five rural areas. All participants provided
written informed consent, completed interviewer-administered laptopbased questionnaires, and had physical measurements taken in the 2004-
08 baseline survey. Besides long-term outcome follow-up for all
participants, periodic resurveys were conducted in 2008 and between
2013 and 2014 in a random sample of about 5% surviving participants
(Supplementary material online, Figure S1). Information collected from
the baseline and resurvey was directly entered into a laptop-based data
entry system developed with built-in functions to avoid missing items and
to minimize logic errors during the interview. Details of the study design
and survey methods have been reported previously.13 The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of the Chinese
Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Beijing, China) and the
Oxford Tropical Research Ethics Committee, University of Oxford (UK).
We excluded participants who reported history of heart disease
(n = 15 472), stroke (n = 7657), or cancer (n = 2385) at baseline. We also
excluded those who had self-reported diabetes or screen-detected diabetes, defined as measured fasting blood glucose >_7.0 mmol/L or random
blood glucose >_11.1 mmol/L at baseline (n = 26 162). Participants with
missing data for BMI (n = 2) were also excluded, leaving 461 047 participants in the present analysis.

age, sex, and study area, as appropriate (Supplementary material online,
Methods).
In the following analyses, age was used as the time scale. The models
were stratified by age in 5-year interval and study area, and adjusted for
sex, education, marital status, menopausal status (women only), and parental family history of CMM. We first used Cox proportional hazards
model to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs of high-risk LFs
(individual or combined) with FCMD, CMM, and all-cause death. In the
analyses of individual LFs, the model included five LFs simultaneously. The
number of high-risk LFs entered the model as a categorical variable, with
0-1 high-risk LFs being the reference group; this variable also entered a
separate model as an ordinal variable to assess the HR of events of interest per one-factor increase in the number of LFs.
We further used multi-state model to assess the role of both individual
and combined LFs in the temporal disease progression from free of CMD
to FCMD, CMM, and death.23 The multi-state model is an extension of
the competing risk model and it is useful to explore how certain factors
influence different phases of a process.24 Five transition stages were constructed based on the natural history of CMM and a previous study4
(transition pattern A, Figure 1): (i) baseline healthy to FCMD; (ii) FCMD
to CMM; (iii) baseline healthy to death from a disease other than IHD,
stroke, and T2D; (iv) FCMD to death from any causes; and (v) CMM to
death from any causes. For participants who entered different states on
the same date (n = 8365), we calculated the entering date of the theoretically prior state as the entering date of the latter state minus 0.5 day. For
example, for participants who died of FCMD, the date of FCMD occurrence equals the date of death minus 0.5 day.
We also used the multi-state model with the same setting to analyse
the effects of LFs on different pathways from baseline to CMM, and to
the absorbing state-death. We divided the FCMDs into four individual
diseases, i.e. IHD, IS, HS, and T2D, resulting in 14 transitions (transition
pattern B, Figure 2). In this pattern, CMM was redefined as having two of
four individual diseases. Because we could not ascertain the temporal sequence of disease occurrences if a participant was diagnosed with at least
two of IHD, IS, HS, and T2D on the same date, we excluded them, leaving
459 606 participants in this analysis.
We predicted the probabilities of becoming an FCMD survivor, CMM
survivor, dead without CMD, dead with FCMD, dead with CMM from
the enrolment to the longest follow-up. Probabilities were separately
obtained for participants who had 0-1 and five high-risk LFs, with all

..
.. covariates being set to the average level of the CKB population in the pre.. sent analysis.
..
Several sensitivity analyses for the multi-state analyses of the transition
..
.. pattern A were conducted: (i) calculating the entering date of the prior
.. state using different time intervals (0.5, 1, 3, and 5 years) for participants
..
.. who entered different states on the same day; (ii) excluding participants
.. who entered different states on the same date; (iii) additionally adjusting
..
.. for hypertension, usage of blood pressure medicine, and statin at baseline;
.. (iv) including participants who had previously diagnosed heart disease,
..
.. stroke, or diabetes, and assigning them to FCMD or CMM state according
.. to their CMD status at baseline; (v) excluding the events occurring in the
..
.. first 2 years of follow-up; and (vi) in addition to the predefined five transi.. tions, adding another transition from the baseline directly to CMM.
..
The multistate analyses of the transition pattern A were further strati..
.. fied according to sex, age, residence area, family history of CMD, and
..
.. hypertension. The interactions were tested by using the likelihood ratio
.. test comparing models with and without a cross-product term.
..
The multi-state model was performed using 'mstate' package of R (ver..
.. sion 3.6.3), and all other analyses were performed using Stata (version 14,

In the separate analysis for individual diseases (transition pattern B;
1441 participants were excluded), 34 304 (7.5% of the baseline
healthy participants) participants' FCMDs were IHD, 31 012 (6.7%)
were IS, 6715 (1.5%) were HS, and 14 215 (3.1%) were T2D (Figure
2). Compared with cases whose FCMD was IHD, IS, or T2D, cases
whose FCMD was HS were more likely to die afterwards, with 3671
(54.7%) died during follow-up.
Overall, men were more likely than women to have high-risk lifestyles, with 55.4% of men and 17.1% of women having three or more
high-risk LFs. Cardiometabolic multimorbidity survivors and participants who died with CMM were more likely to be older, urban resident, and to have hypertension and more high-risk LFs than others
(Supplementary material online, Table S2 and S3). Among 22 965 participants who participated in both the 2004-08 baseline and 2013-14
resurvey, most had not changed their risk level of lifestyles.
Participants between different CMD status groups exhibited no distinct differences in the changes in lifestyles (Supplementary material
online, Table S4).

Cox regression analyses
All five high-risk LFs were associated with an increased risk of FCMD,
CMM, and all-cause death (Supplementary material online, Table S5).
Body shape defined by BMI and WC showed the strongest associations with both FCMD and CMM [HRs (95% CIs): 1.40 (1.38, 1.42)
and 1.63 (1.57, 1.68)]. Smoking showed the strongest association
with death, with an HR (95% CI) of 1.35 (1.31, 1.38). Upward trends

.. were observed for risks of FCMD, CMD, and death with an increas..
.. ing number of high-risk LFs; the corresponding HRs (95% CIs) per
.. one-factor increase was 1.20 (1.19, 1.21), 1.29 (1.27, 1.32), and 1.23
..
.. (1.21, 1.24), respectively. Generally, the effect estimates for associa..
.. tions were slightly stronger for transition to CMM than that for tran.. sition to FCMD.
..
..
.. Multi-state analyses
..
.. Multi-state analyses showed the same result for the transition from
.. baseline (free of CMD) to FCMD as the Cox regression analyses, but
..
.. further distinguished the roles of high-risk LFs in the temporal trajec.. tories of CMM (Figure 3). The impacts of smoking, unhealthy dietary
..
.. habits, and unhealthy body shape on the transition to FCMD were
..
.. stronger than those on the transition to subsequent CMM. The effect
.. estimates of four LFs, except for physical inactivity, were similar for
..
.. the transition from FCMD to death and from CMM to death. Besides,
.. the strength of associations of smoking, excessive drinking, and phys..
.. ical inactivity with mortality outcome (either from healthy, FCMD, or
.. CMM) was greater than that of morbidity outcome. In contrast, the
..
.. opposite was observed for unhealthy body shape.
..
When LFs were combined, gradients in the associations were

.. (Figure 4). Also, we observed a stronger association of the number of

non-daily eating of vegetables, fruits, and eggs, and eating red meat daily or less than weekly; engaging in a sex- and age-specific lower half of total physical activity; having BMI <18.5 or >_28.0 kg/m2 or having waist circumference >_90 cm (men)/85 cm (women).

Cardiometabolic diseases include IHD, IS, HS, and T2D. Cardiometabolic multimorbidity is defined as the occurrence of at least two of the above-mentioned diseases.
Number of events refers to number of cases in each transition.
Multivariable models were stratified by age in the 5-year interval, study area, and adjusted for sex, education, marital status, parental family history of CMM. For analyses of dichotomous lifestyle factors, five lifestyle factors were mutually adjusted. Values shown in bold are statistically significant (P < 0.05).
High-risk lifestyle factors were defined as follows: current smoking or having stopped because of illness; daily drinking >_30 g/day of pure alcohol or having stopped drinking
habit; non-daily eating of vegetables, fruits, and eggs, and eating red meat daily or less than weekly; engaging in a sex- and age-specific lower half of total physical activity; having
BMI <18.5 or >_28.0 kg/m2 or having waist circumference >_90 cm (men)/85 cm (women).

likely to be associated with mortality risk and incidence of IHD and IS
than with HS and T2D. Unhealthy body shape had fewer impacts on
transitions from FCMD or CMM to death than other transitions. We
also observed gradients in associations of combined LFs with all transitions except for the transition from HS to CMM (Table 2).
At the longest follow-up of 13.5 years, given the average level of
covariates in the CKB population, 16.2%, 1.8%, and 1.7% of participants with 0-1 high-risk LFs at baseline were predicted to develop at
least one CMD (after that, survived or died), CMM (after that, survived or died), and die with CMD (including FCMD and CMM)
(Supplementary material online, Figure S2). In contrast, having five
high-risk LFs approximately doubled the risk of developing CMD
(31.9%), tripled the risk of CMM (5.8%), and tripled the risk of death
with CMD (5.0%).

Sensitivity and stratified analyses
The results were not substantially altered in the sensitivity analyses
(Supplementary material online, Tables S6 and S7). Although several
statistically significant interactions were found in the stratified analyses, most of them seemed clinically meaningless (Supplementary material online, Figures S3 and S4). When the analysis was stratified by
residence area or family history of CMD, statistically significant modification effects were only found on one of the five transitions.

Prevalent hypertension modified the associations of the number of
high-risk LFs with three stages of transition, but with a different direction. In contrast, we observed similar impacts of age on the transitions between high-risk LFs and morbidity transitions. Taking those
with 0-1 high-risk LFs as the reference, the associations of having 4-5
factors with incidence transitions were stronger among younger
participants.

Discussion
The present prospective study of 0.5 million Chinese adults found
that five high-risk LFs played important roles in all disease transition
stages from healthy to FCMD, to CMM, and then to death, but to different extents. The associations of LFs with the transition from
healthy to FCMD were stronger than those with the transition from
FCMD to CMM. Also, a stronger impact of LFs on morbidity outcomes (i.e. healthy to FCMD and FCMD to CMM) was observed
among middle-aged than older participants. When we further divided
FCMDs into four individual CMDs, we found that single LFs had different impacts on disease-specific transitions even within the same
transition stage (e.g. four possible disease-specific transitions from
baseline healthy to IHD, IS, HS, and T2D) (Graphical abstract).

Cardiometabolic diseases include IHD, IS, HS, and T2D. Cardiometabolic multimorbidity is defined as the occurrence of at least two of the above-mentioned diseases.
Number of events refers to number of cases in each transition.

Three prior studies conducted in European, US, and Australian
populations estimated the associations of LFs with FCMD and CMM
among participants free of CMD at baseline.4,5,9 Findings from a prospective cohort of 13 174 Australian women aged 45-50 revealed
hazardous impacts of being overweight or obese, physically inactive,
and current smokers on developing FCMD and even stronger effect
estimates for developing CMM.9 A study conducted in the Whitehall
II cohort of 8270 middle-aged UK participants found that current
smoking, alcohol abstention or heavy alcohol consumption, low consumption of fruit and vegetable, and BMI >_25.0 kg/m2 were associated with both FCMD and CMM. Compared with participants
without any high-risk LFs, the HRs (95% CIs) for those with four
high-risk LFs (except for BMI) were 1.64 (1.26-2.13) and 3.09 (1.83-
5.22) for FCMD and CMM, respectively.4 A pooled analysis of individual data from 16 European and US cohorts showed that higher BMI
was associated with a higher risk of CMM, with an odds ratio (95%
CI) of 1.9 (1.8-2.3) per 5 kg/m2 increment.5
Using the same analysis strategy as the above studies, we also
observed a slightly stronger association of LFs with CMM than FCMD.
Although this analysis strategy is conventional for studies on risk factors
for multimorbidity,1 some limitations merit consideration. First, this
strategy uses participants free of CMD at baseline to directly analyse
the association between LFs and the subsequent risk of CMM. Those
who develop only one CMD and survive or die thereafter during the

follow-up period were simply regarded as censored. We find it hard to
distinguish whether the LFs have a different impact on the transition
from healthy to FCMD, from FCMD to CMM, and from FCMD to
death. Second, given the importance of LFs for mortality risk, participants who died from any causes, including their FCMD, had a greater
risk of developing CMM than those who remained alive. The competing risk from death leads to a violation of the independent censoring assumption and could alter the risk estimates.23
Hence, we used the multi-state model, an extension of the competing risk model, to distinguish the difference in impacts of LFs on the five
transitions between healthy, FCMD, CMM, and death. We observed
that LFs had influences on each transition, but to different extents. The
only study using a similar analytic method was based on the Whitehall II
cohort in which the authors found that LFs had a relatively greater role
in the transition from FCMD to CMM than from healthy to FCMD.4
Compared with having no high-risk LFs, the HRs (95% CIs) of having
four high-risk factors were 2.00 (1.40-2.85) and 1.44 (1.22-1.69) for
the transition from FCMD to CMM and transition from healthy to
FCMD, respectively. In contrast, we found that high-risk LFs conferred
a relatively greater risk for transition to FCMD than to CMM.
Besides LFs, several other factors affect the progression from
FCMD to CMM. They may cover up the relative importance of LFs in
determining the risk of developing CMM, to some extent. A systematic
analysis from the Global Burden of Disease 2016 concluded that

Some limitations characterize the present study. First, we used LFs

..
.. adherence and compliance might correlate to the adherence to a
.. healthy lifestyle. However, education, as a surrogate for several health..
.. related behaviours, has been adjusted. The residual confounding from
..
.. treatment is less likely to completely explain the relative risk of LFs
.. with the transition from FCMD to CMM and subsequent death
..
.. observed in the current study.31 Third, some participants were newly
.. diagnosed with two CMDs simultaneously in one admission, causing
..
.. the same diagnosis date for both CMDs. We used an interval of 0.5
.. day to calculate the onset date of FCMD, which might lead to an in..
.. accurate association. However, we tried several different intervals,
.. dropped the same-day participants, and added a 6th transition directly
..
.. from baseline to CMM. None of these additional analyses altered the
.. results significantly. Fourth, the observational nature of our study pre..

.. single CMDs are supported by emerging evidence from prospective
..
.. cohort studies,10,32 Mendelian randomization studies,33,34 and random.. ized controlled trials.35,36 Nevertheless, the casual roles of modifiable

In conclusion, this large-scale prospective cohort of Chinese adults

health-care access and quality in China was relatively lower than that in
UK.25 In China, only 32.2% of diabetes patients were treated, and
15.8% were controlled26; 30.1% of hypertensive patients were treated,
and 7.2% were controlled.27 Even among patients with IHD or stroke,
only half took secondary prevention medicine.28 Nonetheless, LFs
were still non-negligible contributors to the occurrence of CMM. Our
results confirm the well-known role of LFs in the primary prevention
for CMDs29,30 and further provide evidence that there is potential for
lifestyle intervention in contributing to the secondary prevention of
CMDs. In the era of ageing and multimorbidity, it is of great significance
to reduce the rising medication cost and burden of polypharmacy.
Our previous studies in the CKB population estimated that 43.2%
IHD, 39.1% IS, and 78.8% T2D were preventable by adherence to a
healthy lifestyle.15,18,19 In this study, we have extended these findings
from a single disease to multimorbidity. The probabilities of occurring
CMD and CMM for participants having five high-risk LFs were about
two times and three times as high as those having 0-1 LF, suggesting an
enormous preventive potential of lifestyle intervention in the whole
progression of the disease. Our stratified analysis further revealed that
LFs had a relatively larger effect on the risks of FCMD and subsequent
CMM among middle-aged than older participants; and both effect sizes
were similar among middle-aged participants. It is probably due to the
relatively higher baseline hazard for older participants and the survival
effect, i.e. participants at high risk for death had already died before the
enrolment. These findings indicate greater significance in strengthening
lifestyle interventions among younger adults.
Limited by sample size, no previous study was able to further detail
the progression of four specific CMDs and examined the role of LFs
in all possible transitions between healthy and individual CMDs, as
well as individual CMDs to CMM and death as our study. We found
that single LFs had distinct impacts on different transition stages. For
example, an unhealthy body shape was associated with increased
risks of almost all morbidity outcomes (i.e. baseline to FCMD and
FCMD to CMM) but was not associated with the risk of death among
CMD patients. And even within a certain transition stage, single LFs
had different impacts on disease-specific transitions. For example,
smoking was more specifically related to the risk of ischaemic cardiovascular disease (i.e. IHD and IS) than to HS and T2D. In contrast, our
study observed that total physical activity (including occupational,
commuting, domestic, and leisure time physical activity) played roles
in basically all transitions of progression of CMDs, suggesting a universal benefit of being physically active.
The present study provides evidence from a uniquely only Chinese
cohort living in China, an underrepresented population under a
health-care system different from that of developed countries where
most previous studies were conducted. The chief strength of our
study lies in the use of the multi-state model, yielding less biased estimates than the conventional Cox model and distinguishing the impact
of LFs on each transition in the progression trajectory of CMD. It is
also one of the largest prospective studies on associations of LFs with
CMM worldwide. The large number of cases recorded during more
than 10 years of follow-up allowed us to model all possible transitions
from baseline healthy to one of the four FCMDs, and then to CMM
and death. Also, the study includes a nationwide geographically
spread population, with a broad range of ages and diverse sociodemographic characteristics. By performing thorough investigation of

Myocardial bridge is a congenital anomaly in which there is a 'tunnelled'
intramuscular course of a coronary artery segment, mostly involving
the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery.
Computed tomography (CCTA) is unparalleled for its anatomic
capability to diagnose myocardial bridges, while contrast Doppler colour echocardiography is also informative.
The recently implemented measure of peri-coronary fat attenuation
(PCAT) opens to the possibility to evaluate inflammation in each coronary segment of a coronary artery, through simple CCTA postprocessing.
We here show two cases of myocardial bridging, adding such evaluation of PCAT using a dedicated software (Autoplaque version 2.5,
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, USA).
Upper panel shows a curved planar reformation image of LAD coronary artery of a patient evaluated for chest pain. The yellow and the
orange segments demonstrate myocardial bridging (longer the orange
one), while the white proximal and the green distal segments show a
normal superficial course of the coronary artery. In the mid panel, each
segment of the LAD is analysed for PCAT (corresponding colours),
demonstrating that the two tunnelled segments show inflammation
[mean fat attenuation > 70 Hounsfield Units (HU)]. Conversely, fat
attenuation is lower than 70 HU (i.e. normal range) in the segments
without myocardial bridging in the same subject.
The lowest panels show another case, in which contrast echocardiography first raised the suspicion of LAD coronary bridge, confirmed
on CCTA. (Doppler flow reversal in systole shown on the left, colour
Doppler in the mid and on the right CCTA demonstrates inflammation around the bridged segment, red colour in the fat over the bridge.)
The presence of inflammation associated with myocardial bridges could have been suspected on the base of reported endothelial dysfunction and altered vasoreactivity, but it was never described in humans using non-invasive imaging.
