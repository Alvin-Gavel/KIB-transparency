This commentary refers to 'Predict benefit of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator: the MADIT-ICD benefit
score' by A. Youins et al., https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/
ehaa1057 and the discussion piece 'Extending the MADITICD benefit score to heterogenous heart failure populations' by A. Youins and I. Goldenberg, https://doi.org/
10.1093/eurheartj/ehab162.
We read with great interest Youins et al.'s1 recently published article
in the European Heart Journal concerning the Multicenter Automatic
Defibrillator Implantation Trial (MADIT)-implantable cardioverter
defibrillator (ICD) benefit score. They stated that ICD use for the primary prevention of sudden arrhythmic death in patients with heart
failure (HF) was supported through results derived from multiple
large-scale randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and that current
guidelines propose individual risk stratification. Their novel MADITICD benefit score predicts the likelihood of a prophylactic ICD benefit through the personalized risk assessment of life-threatening
ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation weighed against the risk
of non-arrhythmic mortality.
The MADIT-ICD benefit score was developed from patients with
ICDs enrolled in four MADIT studies and then externally validated in
patients with ICDs for primary prevention in the Ranolazine in HighRisk ICD Patients trial. However, in patients with HF, characteristics,
phenotypes, and clinical outcomes vary widely.2 Patients registered in
the RCTs were generally young, without advanced frailty or comorbidities such as systemic malignancy or severe renal dysfunction, and
predominantly from Western countries. Performance evaluation in a
broader range of HF registry patients reflecting real-world data is
warranted. There are important differences in clinical characteristics
and long-term outcomes between East Asian patients with HF and
those in Western countries. East Asians tend to be older, have a

lower body mass index, and present with non-ischaemic HF more
frequently.2 Regional differences in primary prevention ICD use in eligible patients have also been reported, with 10% use in the most recent Swedish HF registry3 and 6.6% use in a recent Japanese cohort
study.4 Moreover, based on data from a single Japanese university
hospital, the mortality rate of Japanese patients who met MADIT-II
study criteria but were without ICDs was comparable with that in a
defibrillator group, but lower than that in a conventional therapy
group in the MADIT-II study.5 These results suggest the need for
international validation of this novel score.
Finally, statistical models such as those in Younis et al. rely
heavily on the ejection fraction (EF). Recent findings from largescale observational studies have indicated that sudden arrhythmic
death is also common in patients with HF with a preserved EF. In
a cohort of hospitalized patients with HF, 31.6% who experienced
sudden cardiac death within 2 years after acute decompensation
had an EF of >_50%.2 Relatively little is known about the risk factors associated with sudden arrhythmic death in these patients.
Exploring the performance of this novel score in this unique but
heterogeneous population may assist in the design of future clinical ICD trials.
We conclude that validation of the MADID-ICD benefit score
should be performed, not only in patients in an RCT setting but also
in a broader range of patients worldwide. The repetitive validation
and modification enable more accurate stratification of patients at
higher risk for sudden arrhythmic death and might improve the
appropriate use of ICDs to help address this life-threatening event
more effectively.

A 49-year-old patient consulted for
abdominal pain and fever, 2 years
after treatment of infective endocarditis on a dual-chamber pacemaker
(PM) with favourable outcome at this
time after treatment by partial surgical removal of the PM and antibiotic
therapy. The lead tips were left in the
right ventricle (RV) and in the left
subclavian vein (thoracic radiography,
Panel A, arrows). Abdominal computed tomography (CT) evidenced a
thick-walled anterior abdominal fluid
collection adjacent to the left liver
lobe (Panel B, arrow) communicating
with the infero-apical part of the RV
on sagittal (Panel C, arrow) and oblique (Panel D, arrow) reconstructions.
The residual fragment of the ventricular probe was no more detected
within the RV. The collection contained a high-density metallic structure (Panels B and C, arrowhead),
suggesting a migration of the RV
probe's fragment through the cardiac
wall, the pericardium, and the diaphragm. Cardiac magnetic resonance
(CMR) imaging confirmed the presence of a transmural fibrous scar of the inferior RV wall in continuity with abdominal collection (Panels E-G,
arrow; Supplementary material online, Videos S1 and S2). An abdominal ultrasound (US) exploration using US contrast revealed a very inflammatory and thickened wall, suggesting a foreign body granuloma (Panel H, arrow; Supplementary material online, Video S3). A CT performed
6 months after antibiotic therapy evidenced a partial regression of the collection (Panel H, arrow). A surgical ablation was scheduled. This unique
case reports highlight the interest of CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to accurately diagnose a migration of probe's fragment.
