with increased odds of ICH (OR 1.62, 99% CI 1.03-2.55) but not with all stroke or ischaemic stroke. There was
no modifying effect by region, prior cardiovascular disease, risk factors, cardiovascular medications, time, or day of
symptom onset. Compared with exposure to neither trigger during the control period, the odds of stroke associated with exposure to both triggers were not additive.

Introduction
As stroke is a leading global cause of death and disability, stroke prevention is a global health priority.1,2 The INTERSTROKE study
reported that 10 potentially modifiable chronic risk factors are collectively associated with 90% of the population-attributable risk
(PAR) of stroke.3 Despite multiple approaches to measuring

cardiovascular risk burden, it remains difficult to predict when a
stroke will occur.4 Importantly, this risk burden predominantly
reflects medium- to long-term exposures (including hyperlipidaemia,
obesity, and smoking) rather than acute exposures with transient
effects that may act as triggers of stroke.5 This has been explored extensively for myocardial infarction, including our report on physical
exertion, anger, or emotional upset as triggers of acute events.6

Methods
Population
INTERSTROKE is a large, international, case-control study carried out in
142 centres in 32 countries, whose methods have previously been described
in detail.14 In brief, cases were patients with acute first stroke (within 5 days
of symptom onset and subsequently confirmed neuroimaging within 1 week
of presentation) who were recruited into INTERSTROKE and completed
questionnaires within 72 hours of hospital admission. Age- and sex-matched
controls (community-based or hospital-based) were also recruited. In these
analyses, we include only the cases of stroke, as the exposure to potential
triggers was collected systematically in cases but not in controls.

Study procedures
Research study staff performed a standardized physical examination on
participants and administered a structured questionnaire. Participants with
acute stroke were asked dichotomous questions, 'Were you angry or
emotionally upset?' and 'Were you engaged in heavy physical exertion?' in
1 hour before the onset of symptoms and during the corresponding 1
hour period on the previous day. Data were also collected for age, sex,
smoking, usual physical activity, stress, education, medication use, and cardiovascular risk factors. Hypertension was defined as a self-reported history of hypertension or blood pressure >_140/90 mmHg (including
adjusted admission blood pressure, as previously reported3). Diabetes
mellitus was defined as self-reported history of diabetes mellitus or glycated haemoglobin >_6.5%. A history of atrial fibrillation prior to presentation was self-reported. Baseline physical activity, including work and leisure
time, was categorized as sedentary (1-3 hours/week), mildly active
(4 hours/week), moderately active (5 hours/week), or strenuous (6 hours/
week). Smoking status was defined as never, former or current smoking.
Baseline level of stress, including work and home time, was dichotomized
as none or some periods vs. several periods or permanent stress.
Depression was defined as feeling sad, blue, or depressed in the 2 weeks
prior to stroke. Education was categorized as none, 1-8 years, 9-12 years,
or Trade School, College or University. Countries were grouped into
seven geographical regions: (i) Western Europe, North America, Australia
(Canada, Australia, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, UK, and Ireland);
(ii) Eastern Europe, Central Europe, Middle East (Croatia, Poland, Turkey,
Iran, United Arab Emirates, Russia, and Saudi Arabia); (iii) China; (iv) South
America (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru); (v)
Southeast Asia (Thailand, Philippines, and Malaysia); (vi) South Asia (India
and Pakistan); and (vii) Africa (South Africa, Mozambique, Uganda, Sudan,
and Nigeria). All data were transferred to the Population Health Research
Institute, McMaster University, and Hamilton Health Sciences (Hamilton,
ON, Canada). The study was approved by appropriate ethics committees
in all centres and/or countries; all participants, or their proxy, provided

.. written informed consent on study enrolment; the study was completed in
..
.. line with ethical standards within each country.
..
..
.. Statistical analysis
.. Categorical variables are presented as percentage (number) and continuous
..
.. variables are presented as mean (standard deviation) or median (25th-75th
.. percentiles), as appropriate. A case-crossover approach was used in which
..
.. each participant acts as his/her own control.15 The case period was defined
.. as the 1 hour before the onset of stroke symptoms; the control period was
.. defined as the corresponding 1 hour period on the day before symptom
..
.. onset. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios
.. (OR) and 99% confidence intervals (CIs) for anger or emotional upset and
..
.. heavy physical exertion within the case period compared with the control
.. period for all stroke, ischaemic stroke, and intracerebral haemorrhage
.. (ICH). Because each participant acted as her or her own control, multivari..
.. able adjustment for baseline confounding factors was not required, but we
.. did adjust for (i) the other triggering event because it varies with time and
..
.. (ii) an interaction between both triggers, as the interaction was statistically
.. significant (P = 0.004). PAR was calculated from the proportion of partici.. pants with exposure to the potential triggers in the case and control peri..
.. ods;16 99% CIs are also reported. The Breslow-Day test of homogeneity
.. was used to explore if the conditional relationship between triggers and
..
.. acute stroke was consistent by the time and day of onset of stroke.17
..
To explore if the associations differed significantly by conventional risk
.. factors
for stroke, analyses were stratified by the following pre-specified sub..
.. groups: age (<45, 45-65, >65 years), sex, smoking, diabetes mellitus, hyper.. tension, atrial fibrillation, body mass index (BMI) (<25, 25-29.9, >_30 kg/m2),
..
.. angina, and myocardial infarction. For anger or emotional upset, stratified
.. analyses were also completed by the baseline level of chronic stress, depres.. sion, and level of education to explore if the associations differed by baseline
..
.. psychosocial factors. For heavy physical exertion, stratified analyses were
.. also completed by the baseline level of physical activity to explore if the
..
.. associations differed by usual level of activity, as a proxy for physical fitness.
.. These subgroup analyses are presented for all stroke, ischaemic stroke, and
.. ICH. For all stroke only, we also explored for differences in the observed
..
.. associations by medications commonly used for the prevention of cardio.. vascular disease [aspirin, beta-blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibi..
.. tor/angiotensin receptor blocker (ACE-i/ARB), lipid-lowering therapy, and
.. oral anticoagulant therapy], geographical region, the time, and the day of the
.. week of symptom onset. Differential effects between stratified analyses
..
.. were considered significant if the P-value for the interaction term between
.. the stratifying variable and the trigger was <0.01; this more conservative
..
.. threshold was chosen to address multiple testing. A sensitivity analysis was
.. restricted to those participants who completed all questionnaires them.. selves, thus excluding those cases of acute stroke in whom questionnaires
..
.. were completed by proxies. All statistical analyses were performed with
.. Stata/MP 16.1, except for PAR, for which R version 3.3.1 for Mac was used.

Although previous studies identified psychological stress,7,8 life events,9
alcohol abuse, clinical infection, anger, coffee intake, sexual activity,
trauma, and surgery as potential triggers of stroke,10-12 few report on
anger or emotional upset or heavy physical exertion, and those studies
had small sample sizes and were completed in one country or geographical region.13 As with medium- to long-term cardiovascular risk
factors, the prevalence and relative importance of triggers may also
vary by geographical region, justifying the need for international studies
with standardized methodologies to explore this question. The
INTERSTROKE study provides an ideal opportunity to explore the association between two potential triggers and acute stroke, including
important effect modifiers, in a large, international population.

period. We had missing data for six participants (<0.1%). Those who
reported anger or emotional upset in the case period were more
likely to be younger and male and to have higher levels of education,
BMI, and baseline stress. They were also more likely to have a history
of diabetes, hypertension, angina, myocardial infarction, or depression and less likely to be taking cardiovascular prevention medications (Supplementary material online, Table S2). Compared with the
control period, anger or emotional upset occurring during the case
period was associated with increased odds of all stroke (OR 1.37,
99% CI 1.15-1.64 and PAR 2.5%, 99% CI 1.2-3.7), ischaemic stroke
(OR 1.22, 99% CI 1.00-1.49 and PAR 1.6%, 99% CI 0.0-3.2), and ICH
(OR 2.05, 99% CI 1.40-2.99 and PAR 2.5%, 99% CI 1.8-5.8) (Figure 1
and Supplementary material online, Table S3). The odds of stroke
occurring in those with anger or emotional upset in the case period
were greater in those without a history of depression for all stroke
(Pinteraction < 0.001), ischaemic stroke (Pinteraction < 0.001), and ICH
(Pinteraction = 0.012). The odds of stroke occurring in those with anger
or emotional upset were greater in those with lower levels of education for all stroke (Pinteraction < 0.001) and ICH (Pinteraction = 0.001),
and in those without a history of diabetes for ICH (Pinteraction =
0.002). There was no other effect modification by age group, sex,
smoking, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, BMI, previous angina, previous myocardial infarction, or baseline level of stress.

Heavy physical exertion as a trigger
Heavy physical exertion was reported by 5.3% (n = 708) of participants during the case period and 5.4% (n = 725) during the control
period. We had missing data for four participants (<0.1%). Those
who reported heavy physical exertion in the case period were more

.. likely to be younger, male, current smokers, and not diabetic. They
..
.. were also more likely to have higher levels of baseline physical activity
..
.. and higher adjusted systolic blood pressure at the time of admission
.. (Supplementary material online, Table S4). Compared with the con..
.. trol period, heavy physical exertion occurring during the case period
.. was not associated with all stroke (OR 1.02, 99% CI 0.82-1.27 and
..
.. PAR 0.1%, 99% CI -1.0 to 1.1) or ischaemic stroke (OR 0.89, 99% CI
.. 0.69-1.14 and PAR -0.6%, 99% CI -2.0 to 0.5) but was associated
..
.. with increased odds of ICH (OR 1.62, 99% CI 1.03-2.55 and PAR
.. -0.9%, 99% CI -4.0 to 1.3) (Figure 2 and Supplementary material on..

.. smoking, diabetes, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, previous angina,

beta-blockers, ACE-i/ARB, lipid-lowering therapy, or oral anticoagulants (Supplementary material online, Table S6).

Effect modification by geographical
region and timing of stroke
In analyses stratified by geographical region, there was no significant
effect modification for the association between all stroke and anger
or emotional upset and heavy physical exertion in the case period
(Figure 3 and Supplementary material online, Table S7). The conditional relationship between each trigger and all stroke was consistent
by time and day of onset (P-value for homogeneity >0.05 for each
comparison).

Ischaemic stroke subtypes
For anger or emotional upset, the greatest magnitude of association
was seen for those with 'other' aetiological classification (OR 2.53,
99% CI 1.30-4.90) (Pinteraction < 0.001) (Table 1). There was no significant effect modification on analyses stratified by Oxfordshire
Community Stroke Project (OCSP) classification (Pinteraction = 0.72).
For heavy physical exertion, there was no significant effect modification on analyses stratified by aetiological classification (Pinteraction =
0.17) or OCSP classification (Pinteraction = 0.43).

Sensitivity analyses
Analyses restricted to participants who completed the questionnaires themselves showed similar results to our primary analyses.
Anger or emotional upset in the case period was associated with
increased odds of all stroke (OR 1.40, 99% CI 1.09-1.81), there was a

weak and non-significant association with ischaemic stroke (OR 1.25,
99% CI 0.95-1.63), but a strong and increased odds of ICH (OR 3.93,
99% CI 1.62-9.56) (Pinteraction = 0.001). There was no association between heavy physical exertion in the case period and all stroke (OR
1.04, 99% CI 0.77-1.40) or ischaemic stroke (OR 0.94, 99% CI 0.68-
1.29), but increased odds of ICH (OR 2.86, 99% CI 1.00-8.15)
(Pinteraction = 0.009).

Discussion
In this large, international study, we report that anger or emotional
upset occurring in the 1 hour before stroke is relatively common and
was associated with all stroke types, particularly for ICH. Heavy physical exertion was associated with increased odds of ICH only. No additive effects were seen in participants with both heavy physical exertion
and anger or emotional upset in the 1 hour before stroke, and there
were no significant differences by geographical region (Graphical
Abstract). Our findings are consistent with previous, although limited,
research13,18 and extend findings to an international global population.
Although long-term exposure to established cardiovascular risk
factors is associated with 90% of the PAR of stroke (controlled for
age and sex),3 they do not explain circadian or seasonal variations in
stroke incidence. Although multiple studies report on the role of potential triggering events of myocardial infarction,6,19 less is known
about potential triggering events of stroke. In the setting of already
reduced perfusion, such as the presence of atherosclerotic plaque,
exposure to a trigger may lead to a cardiovascular event.20 However,
the pathogenesis of ischaemic stroke is more varied and less often

The case-crossover design is a powerful approach to study potential external triggers, and effect modification, as each individual serves
as his or her own control, thereby controlling for many potential
confounders. We did adjust for exposure to the other potential triggering event, which may vary with time within the individual, unlike
common risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes. We chose

..
The main strengths of this study include the case-control design,
..
.. ideal to explore the potential impacts of triggering events, and the
..
.. large international nature of the cohort with first stroke. This also
.. provides us with the ability to explore the role of effect modifiers be..
.. cause of the sample size. INTERSTROKE includes large numbers of
.. individuals from all regions of the world and multiple ethnicities, mak..
.. ing the results broadly applicable. INTERSTROKE also includes only
.. participants with first stroke, thereby reducing the possibility that
..
.. altered lifestyles or risk factors resulting from previous stroke would
.. affect our estimates. In addition, sensitivity analyses yielded similar
..
.. associations.
..
The main limitation of this study is recall bias. Although the case..
.. crossover approach, where each participant acts as her or her own
.. control, reduces the effect of differences in perception within partici..
.. pants, participants who experienced stroke may differentially recall
.. the intensity of exposure and may recall exposures as more proxim..
.. ate to the symptom onset. In addition, proxies completed question..
.. naires on behalf of some participants, who were limited by functional
.. impairment or disability (e.g. participants with anosognosia, amnesia,
..
.. or aphasia), further contributing to recall bias. However, sensitivity
.. analyses restricted to participants who completed questionnaires
..
.. themselves were similar to our primary results. Second,
.. INTERSTROKE uses an observational design, meaning that we can..
.. not establish causation. Third, exposure to potential triggering events
.. was self-reported and objective scales were not used, as in some pre..
.. vious studies. As our comparison using the case-crossover approach
.. is within individuals, it is unlikely that the lack of objective scales
..
.. would significantly impact our findings as the participant is likely to in.. terpret heavy physical exertion, anger, or emotional upset consist..
.. ently over time. In addition, our primary findings are consistent with
.. studies of triggers of cardiovascular events, suggesting that our meas..
.. urements of the exposures are equally valid. Fourth, although stand.. ardized methodology was used in all regions, risk factors were self..
.. reported. However, this would likely result in an underestimation of
..
.. the prevalence of risk factors and bias estimates towards the null.
.. Similarly, because INTERSTROKE only includes those patients pre..
.. senting with first stroke, these data cannot be applied to the impact
.. of triggering events in a secondary prevention population.
..
..
..
..
.. Conclusions
..
.. We report that anger or emotional upset is common in the 1 hour
..
.. before the onset of symptoms of stroke and was associated with all
.. stroke types. In contrast, the evidence is less convincing to support
..
.. heavy physical exertion as an external trigger for stroke. There was
.. no important effect modification by geographical region, time and day

.. of onset of stroke, cardiovascular prevention medications, and many

1 hour as the case period as the transient effects of external triggers
decrease significantly with time after exposure, modifying the likelihood that an association between external triggers and stroke would
be found. Triggers, such as acute exposure to anger or emotional
upset or heavy physical exertion, are thought to lead to sympathetic
activation,21 catecholamine secretion,22 vasoconstriction, and
increased heart rate and blood pressure.12 Given the importance of
raised blood pressure as a risk factor for stroke, and variation in PAR
between ischaemic stroke and ICH,3 it is plausible that the effects of
an external trigger may also differ by stroke type. While short-term
increases in blood pressure may precipitate the onset of ICH,12 we
speculate that short-term increases in heart rate may lead to an episode of atrial fibrillation, leading to the cardiac thrombus formation
and a delayed onset of ischaemic stroke (i.e. beyond 1 hour and outside our case period). Although we had limited numbers of participants with underlying atrial fibrillation before stroke and the
interaction term was not statistically significant, our stratified analyses
suggest increased odds of all stroke and ischaemic stroke with heavy
physical exertion in the case period, consistent with this hypothesis.
As exposure to external triggers is common and clearly does not
always lead to stroke, we sought to identify those most at risk from
acute exposures. We found no significant effect modification for the
association between triggering events and stroke, on stratification by
multiple cardiovascular risk factors (including smoking, hypertension,
atrial fibrillation, previous angina, or myocardial infarction), common
cardiovascular prevention medications, time, or day of onset of
symptoms of stroke. Although previous studies reported circadian
variation in the time of onset of stroke, with a peak in the late morning,23,24 we found no effect modification in the association between
triggers and stroke by the time of symptom onset. In addition, although the greatest proportion of strokes occurred on Monday, we
also found no effect modification in the association between triggers
and stroke by the day of symptom onset.24 Our results from
INTERSTROKE add to the literature as we remain limited in our ability to identify those most vulnerable to the effects of external triggers
through risk factor stratification.
We did observe an increase in the odds of all stroke, ischaemic
stroke, and ICH with anger or emotional upset during the case period
in those without a history of depression and also in those with lower
levels of education. Taken together, this suggests that those with
higher levels of anger or psychological stress may have become
acclimatized to the physiological responses to anger or emotional
upset, which may blunt the physiological response to acute exposure
to anger or upset.18 Therefore, our findings highlight the importance
of minimizing exposure to anger or emotional upset for the majority
of the population.
Regular physical activity is known to play a role in the long-term
prevention of cardiovascular disease. We did not observe any association between heavy physical exertion and acute stroke and no significant effect modification on analyses stratified by the baseline level
of physical activity. This contrasts against a previous study that
reported moderate-to-extreme physical exertion as a potential trigger of subarachnoid haemorrhage,25 although the pathogenesis of
stroke is different. Therefore, we continue to recommend regular
physical activity for the prevention of cardiovascular disease, consistent with previous meta-analyses.26
