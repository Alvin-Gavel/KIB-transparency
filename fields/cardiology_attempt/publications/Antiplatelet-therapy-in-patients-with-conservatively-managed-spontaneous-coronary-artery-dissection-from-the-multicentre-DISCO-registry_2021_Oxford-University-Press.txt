Aims

The role of antiplatelet therapy in patients with spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) undergoing initial
conservative management is still a matter of debate, with theoretical arguments in favour and against its use. The
aims of this article are to assess the use of antiplatelet drugs in medically treated SCAD patients and to investigate
the relationship between single (SAPT) and dual (DAPT) antiplatelet regimens and 1-year patient outcomes.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods and
We investigated the 1-year outcome of patients with SCAD managed with initial conservative treatment included
in the DIssezioni Spontanee COronariche (DISCO) multicentre international registry. Patients were divided into
results

two groups according to SAPT or DAPT prescription. Primary endpoint was 12-month incidence of major adverse
cardiovascular events (MACE) defined as the composite of all-cause death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), and
any unplanned percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Out of 314 patients included in the DISCO registry, we
investigated 199 patients in whom SCAD was managed conservatively. Most patients were female (89%), presented
with acute coronary syndrome (92%) and mean age was 52.3 +/- 9.3 years. Sixty-seven (33.7%) were given SAPT

whereas 132 (66.3%) with DAPT. Aspirin plus either clopidogrel or ticagrelor were prescribed in 62.9% and 36.4%
of DAPT patients, respectively. Overall, a 14.6% MACE rate was observed at 12 months of follow-up. Patients
treated with DAPT had a significantly higher MACE rate than those with SAPT [18.9% vs. 6.0% hazard ratios (HR)
2.62; 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.22-5.61; P = 0.013], driven by an early excess of non-fatal MI or unplanned
PCI. At multiple regression analysis, type 2a SCAD (OR: 3.69; 95% CI 1.41-9.61; P = 0.007) and DAPT regimen
(OR: 4.54; 95% CI 1.31-14.28; P = 0.016) resulted independently associated with a higher risk of 12-month MACE.

Conclusions
In this European registry, most patients with SCAD undergoing initial conservative management received DAPT.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                   

Graphical Abstract

Thirty-day and 12-month impact of different antiplatelet regimens on spontaneous coronary artery dissection conservatively treated as first treatment
strategy following angiographic diagnosis of spontaneous coronary artery dissection. The cumulative hazard curve for major adverse cardiac events at 12
months and 30 days were depicted in the lower left part of the figure. Twelve-month incidence of major adverse cardiac events, cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and unplanned PCI in both two groups was represented in the lower right part. SAPT, single antiplatelet therapy; DAPT, dual antiplatelet
therapy. In the upper panel is depicted the same curve focusing in the first 3 months. *Defined as conservative medical treatment as first strategy following
angiographic diagnosis of SCAD. Among those, three cases in which no APT was administered because of clinical drawback or allergy were not included in
the final analysis.

Introduction
Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an increasingly

indeed, it has been under-diagnosed for years due to the lack of modern diagnostic tools (e.g. intravascular imaging) and low awareness of
the disease.6,7 Observations collected from contemporary SCAD
case series have led to the general consensus that conservative therapy should be considered as a first-line approach in the absence of

Yet, at 1-year follow-up, DAPT, as compared with SAPT, was independently associated with a higher rate of adverse cardiovascular events (ClinicalTrial.gov id: NCT04415762).

Antiplatelet therapy in patients with conservatively managed SCAD

Methods
Patient population
DISCO (DIssezioni Spontanee COronariche) IT/SPA (ClinicalTrials.gov id:
NCT04415762) is an observational, international, multicentre, retrospective registry that enrolled SCAD patients from 23 centres in Italy and Spain
(see participating centres in Supplementary material online, Appendix).
All patients discharged with a diagnosis of non-atherosclerotic SCAD
and aged >18 years were enrolled in the registry from 1 January 2009 to
31 December 2019. The diagnosis of SCAD was further confirmed by
the core lab organized for this study by the co-ordinating centre. For the
present analysis, we identified in the registry all cases satisfying the following inclusion criteria: (i) conservative medical treatment as the first strategy following angiographic diagnosis of SCAD and (ii) availability of data
on prescribed APT. Patients were divided into two groups according to
the antiplatelet regimen prescribed after the angiographic diagnosis of
SCAD: (i) SAPT (with either aspirin 100 mg or a P2Y12 inhibitor) and (ii)
DAPT (with aspirin 100 mg plus a P2Y12 inhibitor).

Data collection
Demographics, clinical presentation, treatment modality, angiographic
findings, administered drugs, and early and late outcomes were extracted
from the hospital databases of each centre. In case of missing data, the
general practitioner or the patient himself was contacted or an in-person
visit was scheduled to obtain the information needed. A dedicated electronic case report form (eCRF) was properly designed on the
Cardiogroup.org research website. Data from each site were entered
into the eCRF and the co-ordinating centre (Rivoli-Orbassano) generated
the analysis reported in this manuscript. A dedicated data manager ( Luca
Lo Savio (L.L.S.)) was in charge of source verification, quality control, and
queries generation from the co-ordinating centre to the participating sites
in order to minimize bias. Follow-up data were collected by each centre
through a review of medical records or during outpatient visits and/or
telephone contacts. The study was approved by the institutional review
committees and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of

.. Helsinki; an informed consent to be submitted to the patient and an infor..
.. mation letter addressed to the general practitioners were drawn up.
..
..
.. Angiographic analysis
.. All coronary angiograms were reviewed by a core laboratory involving
..
.. the co-ordinating centre (Rivoli-Orbassano) and the leading recruiting
.. centre of the study (Madrid). Angiograms were first sent to the co-ordi..
.. nating centre and reviewed by two experienced interventional cardiolo.. gists (G.Q. and C.R.) to confirm the diagnosis of SCAD and angiographic
..
.. type. In this phase, the cardiologists were blinded to clinical data and scan
.. timepoint. In case of disagreement, consensus was achieved after discus.. sion with a 3rd interventional cardiologist (Francesco Tomassini (F.T.)).
..
.. Additional angiograms performed during the index hospitalization or fol.. low-up as well as any intracoronary imaging available were also reviewed
..
.. to improve diagnostic accuracy. After a confirmed diagnosis of SCAD at
.. the co-ordinating centre, the angiographic classification was performed in
..
.. a 2nd stage by both the Italian (G.Q., C.R., and E.C.) and the Spanish
.. centre (R.M., F.M., and J.E.), with a previous consensus agreement on the
..
.. specific criteria to be used, as well as subsequent online meetings to dis.. cuss unclear cases. All cases with concomitant presence of significant ath.. erosclerotic disease (>_50% diameter stenosis) in other coronary arterial
..
.. segments or with an underlying complicated plaque as revealed by intra.. coronary imaging were excluded from the present registry.
..
..
.. Definitions and outcomes
..
.. Spontaneous coronary artery dissection was classified according to the
.. angiographic classification reported previously.1,18 Briefly, type 1 was an
..
.. angiographic radiolucent 'flap' and linear double lumen often associated
.. with contrast hold-up; type 2 was a long (>20 mm) diffuse and smooth
..
.. stenosis divided into type 2a where there is recrudescence of a normal
.. calibre distal vessel and type 2b where the stenosis extends angiographi.. cally to the end of the vessel. Type 3 pattern was defined as focal angio..
.. graphically indistinguishable from a focal atherosclerotic stenosis
.. requiring diagnostic confirmation by intracoronary imaging. A complete
..
.. occlusion pattern was defined as type 4. For diagnosing angiotype 4, the
.. presence of other typical angiographic characteristics (angiotype 1 and 2),
..
.. visible at the time of the baseline injections, during the percutaneous cor.. onary intervention (PCI) or in surveillance angiograms, was necessary to
..
.. establish the diagnosis of SCAD when intracoronary imaging was not
.. used.
..
During the diagnostic process, in the case of recurrent SCAD, it was
..
.. specified whether it was on the same segment or on another one.
.. According to recent data,14 spontaneous SCAD healing usually occurs
..
.. within 30 days of the acute event in the majority of patients. Following
.. this evidence, core-lab members decided to define 'recurrent SCAD' (i) a
..
.. new SCAD in a different coronary vessel or (ii) a new SCAD of the same
.. coronary vessel that occurred after 30 days.
..
The primary clinical outcome was (i) 12-month major adverse cardio..
.. vascular events (MACE)-a composite of all cause of death, non-fatal
.. myocardial infarction (MI), and any unplanned revascularization (either
..
.. percutaneous or surgical). Secondary endpoints were (i) in-hospital
.. MACE; (ii) single MACE components both in hospital and at 12 months;
..
.. and (iii) bleeding events at 12 months assessed according to the Bleeding
.. Academic Research Consortium (BARC) classification.19 Myocardial in..
.. farction was defined according to the 4th universal definition of MI.20 In
.. case of a confirmed or suspected adverse event, this was reported in a
..
.. specific section of the eCRF. Coronary angiographies as well as available
.. clinical information (clinical presentation, 12 lead electrocardiogram,
.. troponin I values) were checked by the co-ordinating centre to adjudicate
..
. the event as MACE.

clinical high-risk features8-12: dissections can resolve spontaneously
over time after conservative management due to recollection of the
intimal flap or resorption of the intramural haematoma (IMH).13,14
Scarce data, however, are available regarding the type of medical
treatment in such patients, who generally lack underlying atheroma.
The choice of optimal antiplatelet therapy (APT) remains an unmet
need. On the one hand, powerful platelet inhibition may worsen
intramural haemorrhage; on the other hand, it may reduce the
thrombotic risk linked to sub-endothelium exposure to flowing
blood and reduce shear-mediated platelet activation that occurs at
the sites of critical true lumen narrowing.3 As a result, some degree
of APT is to date considered helpful in SCAD.
However, the appropriate type and duration of APT have yet to
be defined. Because of bleeding concerns, some authors suggest the use
of clopidogrel15 in the dual APT (DAPT) regimen, although ACS guidelines (without making a special case for SCAD) recommend a 12-month
therapy with a stronger P2Y12 inhibitor for all ACS.16,17 A possible correlation between different antiplatelet regimens and clinical outcomes in
SCAD is lacking and no study has, to date, evaluated this issue.
Thus, the aim of the present analysis was to evaluate the safety of
DAPT vs. single APT (SAPT) in medically managed patients with
SCAD.

Categorical and binary variables were compared between groups using
v2 tests. Continuous variables were compared using t-test, or Wilcoxon
signed-rank test in case of non-normal distributions. For MACE and its
components, time-to-event analyses were performed. Results are
reported using hazard ratios (HR), 95% two-sided confidence intervals
(CI), and cumulative hazard curves. Univariate and multivariable Cox regression analyses were used to identify independent predictors of MACE
in the conservative treatment group. Variables related to clinical outcomes in univariate analysis (P < 0.10) were included in the multivariable
model. Age and sex were included as background variables. A stepwise
logistic regression model with an entry and exit level of significance of
0.10 was used to identify variables independently associated with MACE.
A sensitivity analysis was performed excluding specific clinical or angiographic features considered at higher risk of events [age > 60 years; >_3
cardiovascular risk factors; ST-elevation MI (STEMI) at presentation; ejection fraction <55%; angiographic type 2a SCAD] to identify potential factors that may influence the primary conclusion.
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 22.0 (IBM, Armonk,
NY, USA), R-project statistical software, STATA 16.0 (StataCorp,
College Station, TX, USA), and Graphpad Prism 4 (La Jolla, CA, USA). All
tests were two-sided and P-values <0.05 were considered statistically
significant.

anterior descending artery was the most frequently involved coronary
artery (52.8%), followed by the left circumflex artery-obtuse marginal
branch (26.7%) and the right coronary artery (19.3%). Multi-vessel
SCAD was reported in 17 cases (8.5%) and angiographic type 2 SCAD
was the predominant one with 120 cases (60.2%). Intracoronary imaging [intravascular ultrasound/optical coherence tomography (IVUS/
OCT)] was performed in 20 patients (10.1%): in 16 cases (8.1%) only
OCT was employed, in 2 (1.0%) cases only IVUS, whereas both OCT
and IVUS were used in the last 2 cases (1.0%).

Drug management at discharge
In SAPT, aspirin 100 mg daily was the preferred antiplatelet drug in
most cases (92.5%) with a lifelong indication in all cases. Cardiologists
indicated clopidogrel (62.9%) or ticagrelor (36.4%) along with aspirin
in DAPT regimens for 12 months in almost all cases (96.3%). In three
cases, DAPT was prescribed for 6 months and in the other two cases
for 18 and 24 months, respectively (Figure 2). In the DAPT group
(n = 132), 46 (35.4%) patients presented with STEMI and 74 with
NSTE-ACS (56.9%), whereas in the SAPT group (n = 67), 28 patients
presented with STEMI (42.4%) and 35 with NSTE-ACS (53.0%). The

.. choice of the antiplatelet regimen (DAPT or SAPT) was not different

coronary angiography showed an SCAD involving the left coronary
circumflex and the patient died 20 days after hospital admission due
to irreversible hypoxic encephalopathy. Recurrent SCAD occurred
in 12 (6.0%) patients, with 6 of them within 6 months after discharge.

Twelve-month outcome
Follow-up was available in 199 (100%) patients after discharge. A
total of 197 patients (99.0%) were followed up for >_6 months, and
194 (98.0%) for >_12 months. The mean follow-up was
11.8 +/- 1.3 months. In 52 (25.7%) patients, a scheduled surveillance
coronary angiography was performed to confirm SCAD healing after
the conservative approach (Figure 3) or to evaluate the long-term result of bail-out PCI indicated for failed medical management of SCAD
(Figure 4). At 12 months, 29 patients (14.6%) experienced an MACE:
1 death, 22 non-fatal MI, and 17 unplanned PCI. Dual antiplatelet
therapy was associated with a higher 1-year MACE rate compared
with SAPT (18.9% vs. 6.0%; HR 2.62, 95% CI 1.22-5.61, P = 0.013).
Both non-fatal MI (15.2% vs. 3.0%; HR 3.20, 95% CI 1.33-7.69,
P = 0.009) and unplanned PCI (12.1% vs. 1.5%; HR 3.69, 95% CI 1.36-
9.91, P = 0.01) mostly occurred early within the 1st month and contributed to this excess in MACE (Graphical abstract, Table 4, and

At 12 months, bleeding events occurred in 15 (7.5%) patients [12
(9.1%) in DAPT vs. 3 (4.5%) in SAPT; P = 0.24]. Of these, two bleeding
events occurred in the hospital, both in the DAPT group. All events
were classified as minor bleeding: 10 BARC 1 and 5 BARC 2 (Table 4).
Twelve (6.0%) patients experienced recurrent SCAD, with 6 of them
within 6 months after discharge: 10 patients (7.6%) were on DAPT
whereas 2 (3.0%) on SAPT with no significant difference between them
(P = 0.2; Supplementary material online, Appendix Table SB).
At multivariable Cox regression analysis, type 2a SCAD (HR 3.69;
95% CI 1.41-9.61; P = 0.007) and DAPT regimen (HR 4.54; 95% CI
1.31-14.28; P = 0.016) were independent predictors of 12-month
MACE (Figure 5). The proportionality assumptions were checked
graphically by plotting the log cumulative hazard vs. (log) time at follow-up and by applying a test based on Schoenfeld residuals that
failed to reject the null hypothesis that event rate was affected by
time (P = 0.702).
The cumulative hazard curves for any composite outcome
(Supplementary material online, Figure SA) as well as an additional
MACE-survival analysis curve up to 24 months (Supplementary material online, Figure SB) are reported in the Supplementary material

The results of sensitivity analyses were consistent with those from
the primary analysis leading to similar conclusions (Supplementary
material online, Appendix Table SC).

Discussion
The main results obtained from our study are the following: (i) in
contemporary clinical practice, most patients with SCAD undergoing
initial conservative management receive antiplatelet treatment, with
DAPT prescribed in two-thirds of cases; (ii) at 12 months, DAPT is
associated with a higher MACE rate compared with SAPT, mainly
driven by an early excess of non-fatal MI or unplanned PCI; and (iii)
DAPT and angiographic type 2a SCAD are independently associated
with worse outcome (Graphical abstract).
Advancements in the knowledge of the causes and clinical evolution of SCAD largely rely on the analysis of large series of patients
reflecting a palette of pathological substrates, clinical presentations,
and therapeutic attitudes. This approach was applied also to our research, which provides a snapshot on the antithrombotic strategies in
patients with conservatively treated SCAD. Dual antiplatelet therapy,

particularly aspirin plus clopidogrel, was the most common APT used
in SCAD patients from the participating centres of this study. These
data are in keeping with those observed in non-European countries
in the largest prospective SCAD cohort reported to date21 and in
other large contemporary series.15,22,23 Overall, more than twothirds of conservatively managed patients are discharged on DAPT,
usually extended up to 12 months, and statin, regardless of the unconventional type of ACS. Existing evidence and guidelines on ACS
strongly support DAPT with a potent P2Y12 inhibitor, regardless of
the management strategy adopted (PCI or conservative).24-26
Conversely, the benefit of any APT in conservatively managed SCAD
is uncertain and controversial. The American and European position
statements on SCAD management1,2 do not recommend firmly APT
regimens for medically managed patients and cast doubts on the
benefit of DAPT. However, given the lack of evidence, it seems reasonable to at least avoid potent P2Y12 inhibitors.
The antithrombotic effect of antiplatelet agents may enhance intramural bleeding causing propagation of the dissection and subsequent
events, as well as it may cause a delay in the natural resorption of
IMH.4 On the other hand, the presence of a thrombus in the true
lumen of spontaneously dissected vessels has been documented in

OCT studies27,28 supporting a role for APT at least in the early stages
of SCAD. Our results suggest that DAPT may be harmful in terms of
safety compared with SAPT for conservatively managed patients,
with an excess of Re-infarction and urgent revascularization occurring early after initial SCAD presentation. These findings support the
hypothesis that a more potent APT may have deleterious effects in
SCAD by inducing IMH propagation. Moreover, APT may cause menorrhagia in these patients who are 90% women, with about half in
the premenopausal state.2 In this regard, in our population, 15 bleeding events occurred, of which 2 during hospitalization. Since the

SCAD population is predominantly young, as expected all events
reported were minor bleedings (75% BARC 1, 25% BARC 2), but a
higher incidence of bleeding was reported in the DAPT group,
though not significantly different from the SAPT group. Additionally,
both in-hospital bleeding events were recorded in patients on DAPT.
The early occurrence of adverse events seen in our series (more
than a half of the total within the 1st month) is an important finding
that is in line with previous reports.21,22,29 Recently, data on 30-day
SCAD readmission rates were reported from a large nationwide readmission database in the USA.30 Authors estimated a higher re-

Antiplatelet therapy in patients with conservatively managed SCAD

medically with dual antiplatelet therapy plus beta-blocker. (B) Five days later during the in-hospital stay, she complained of angina. Coronary angiography showed type 2b spontaneous coronary artery dissection and a TIMI flow 2. A wire was gently manipulated and advanced distally. Intravascular
ultrasound pullback confirmed the presence of dissection and intramural haematoma compressing the true lumen. (C) Final angiographic result after

admission rate in SCAD compared with a non-SCAD ACS cohort
(12.3% vs. 9.9%; P = 0.022) with the cardiac cause being the leading
reason for re-hospitalization. This underscores the importance of
close surveillance with prolonged monitoring of conservatively managed SCAD patients.31
A possible explanation for the association of early clinical SCAD
progression with the deleterious effects of DAPT is the pathological
substrate of a contained compressive IMH. The contained (not

teared) IMH is thought to be caused by the rupture of vasa vasorum
with subsequent micro-vessel haemorrhage in the lamina media
('outside-in' mechanism).32 This hypothesis raised the concern that
antithrombotic therapy in such patients may worsen intramural bleeding with further propagation and compression, ultimately resulting in
clinical adverse progression. On the other hand, when an intimomedial
tear communicating both lumens is present, a hypothetical drug-mediated increase of mural bleeding would not have such a clinical impact

because the haematoma would be released into the circulation. In a
study by Waterbury et al.29 on conservatively managed SCAD, angiographic presentation as 'pure' IMH entailed a greater risk of early clinical progression compared with the angiographic radiolucent 'flap' and
linear double lumen (intimomedial tear with communication between
false and true lumens) after adjusting for several confounders. GarciaGuimaraes et al.22 reported similar findings from a large multicentre
registry, in which type 2 SCAD, defined by the presence of long contained IMH (>20 mm), was found to be an independent predictor of
in-hospital MACE. Interestingly, type 2a was independently related to
MACE occurrence in our cohort, and DAPT was found to be an independent predictor of poor outcome in the same analysis. Taken together, our data seem to support the hypothesis that potent
antithrombotic/APT may be harmful in conservatively managed SCAD
patients, especially those with contained IMH.

Limitations
Although this is the largest European SCAD series reported so far,
the sample size may have limited statistical power. This was an observational study analysing different treatment regimens with no randomization, which entails inherent limitations. Consequently, our
results should be interpreted with caution and should be regarded as
hypothesis generating. A number of limitations should be clearly
acknowledged. First, the observational design is without a prior sample size calculation that may have limited statistical power. The choice
of antiplatelet treatment was at the physician's discretion and could
be potentially influenced by many clinical or angiographic features
that we cannot identify. Consequently, the absence of randomization
entails important limitations, as we cannot control all the potential
baseline differences or residual confounders in the two study groups.
Second, despite a systematic review of all cases in a dedicated core
lab, some patients with atherosclerotic coronary artery disease could
have been included given the limited use of intracoronary imaging to
confirm SCAD diagnosis. Moreover, we cannot exclude a potential
influence of the use of imaging tools on the antiplatelet regimen
chosen. Third, despite a large data collection, some clinical and

..
.. instrumental information is missing. Unfortunately, it was not possible
.. to retrieve full information about all surface ECG performed during
..
.. hospitalization and, consequently, to correlate the site of ischaemia
.. detected on ECG with the PCI target vessel for all cases. Finally, as in
..
.. any research focused on low-prevalence disease, the statistical power
.. of multivariable analysis is limited by the low numbers of events.
..
.. Consequently, our findings should be interpreted taking into consid..
.. eration all the aforementioned issues, waiting for future research
.. focused on this topic. We make a call for further research to eluci..
.. date the role of antithrombotic treatment in SCAD.
..
..
..
.. Conclusions
..
..
.. In medically treated SCAD patients, the risk of subsequent MI or un..
.. planned coronary revascularization is not trivial and occurs mostly
.. within the 1st month. Although DAPT is currently the most frequent..
.. ly adopted regimen in conservatively managed SCAD patients, we
.. observed that DAPT entailed a more than two-fold increased risk of
..
.. MACE compared with SAPT after 12 months of follow-up. Our find.. ings should be interpreted with caution and warrant further confirm..
.. ation. However, since APT in conservatively managed SCAD has
..
.. remained unsupported by evidence so far, this study may inform car.. diologists in their decision-making, which should always be individual..
