Introduction
Despite a marked improvement in the survival and overall life expectancy of children born with congenital heart disease (CHD), the majority of those that became adults [adult congenital heart disease
(ACHD)] suffer from residua of their primary cardiac defect and clinical sequelae, independent of prior surgical or transcatheter interventions. Consequently, ACHD is associated with a high rate of
healthcare utilization, which in an ideal world should take place at
dedicated medical centres with clinical expertise in the field.1-3
Nonetheless, fragmentation of care remains a concern, especially
when acute symptoms occur and patients present to the nearest hospital with an emergency department (ED). Large variations in ED infrastructure as well as acute cardiac care and emergency medicine
practice exist even in countries with advanced healthcare systems.4,5
Currently, no international recommendations exist regarding the
emergency care of ACHD patients. Therefore, the aim of this position document is to provide a consensus regarding the management
of the most common acute clinical scenarios in ACHD, which are
relevant for the ED.
Although many of the problems described in this paper are
not unique to ACHD patients [e.g. arrhythmia or heart failure
(HF)], they may be more common or require different management strategies than in non-ACHD patients. The recommendations provided are based on available evidence and expert
opinion.

.. Arrhythmias and syncope
..
..
.. General remarks
.. The most common emergency in ACHD is arrhythmia, accounting
..
.. for 37% of emergency admissions.5 Arrhythmias are also the most
.. common cause for syncope in ACHD. However, other causes, such
..
.. as pulmonary hypertension (PH) and neurologic causes, need to be
..
.. excluded. The incidence and origin of arrhythmias vary depending on
... the complexity of disease, possible scar formation after reparative
.. surgery and the presence of prosthetic material and residual lesions.
..
On presentation, patients should receive a 12-lead electrocardio..
.. gram (ECG) and device interrogation (if applicable) promptly.
..
In ACHD patients, differentiation between atrial and ventricular
..
.. tachycardia (VT) may often be difficult due to a broad QRS complex
..
.. and/or aberrant conduction. They should carry an electronic copy of
.. their resting 12-lead ECG with them to share with the ED staff. In
..
.. case of doubt, any broad complex tachycardia should be treated as
..
.. ventricular in origin. Electrocardiogram documentation of the initial
.. cardiac rhythm on admission prior to any antiarrhythmic drugs (such
..
.. as amiodarone) or other medical interventions that reduce heart rate
.. is paramount for subsequent electrophysiological assessment includ..
.. ing amenability to ablation therapy.

Adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) patients represent a growing population with increasing use of acute emergency department (ED) care. Providing
comprehensive ED care necessitates an understanding of the most common clinical scenarios to improve morbidity and mortality in this population. The
aim of this position document is to provide a consensus regarding the management of the most common clinical scenarios of ACHD patients presenting
to the ED.

by rapid conduction through the atrioventricular node. Atrial tachycardia conducted 1:1 can potentially lead to syncope and sudden cardiac death (SCD).8 If patients present in a haemodynamically unstable
condition, immediate termination of AT with electrical or pharmacological cardioversion is necessary. Electrical cardioversion is the preferred choice in haemodynamically unstable conditions as it is more
effective than pharmacological cardioversion. In contrast, in a haemodynamically stable situation, medical treatment and/or referral to a
dedicated ACHD arrhythmia centre for an invasive approach is appropriate (Figure 1).
In selected, haemodynamically stable ACHD patients, after consultation with electrophysiology colleagues, accepting the persistence
of AT (after medical heart rate reduction) is recommended to facilitate early electrophysiological ablation therapy with location of the
underlying culprit lesion.

Ventricular arrhythmias
Ventricular arrhythmias encompass monomorphic and polymorphic
VTs as well as ventricular fibrillation (VF) and the incidence varies
according to the underlying CHD. In patients with repaired tetralogy
of Fallot (ToF), the incidence of VT has been reported as high as
14.6% whilst VF was documented in 0.5%.9
It is unclear whether improvements in surgical techniques and earlier management of VT risk factors such as right ventricular dilatation
and dysfunction will reduce this incidence in the future. However,

.. nowadays malignant arrhythmias remain an issue for ToF patients and
..
.. should be excluded when patients present with syncope.
..
The incidence of VT, VF, and SCD increases with the complexity
..
.. of CHD.10 For acute termination of VT, electrical cardioversion is
..
.. the treatment of choice. The most widely used antiarrhythmic drug
.. in ACHD patients is amiodarone, which is also preferred in patients
..
.. with structural heart disease (Figure 1).
..
..
..
.. Bradyarrhythmias
..
.. Bradycardias and high-degree atrioventricular block (AVB) may lead
.. to syncope, HF due to low cardiac output or bradycardia-related
..
.. ventricular arrhythmia (tachy-brady syndrome). Complete heart
.. block is potentially a precursor of SCD.11 Atrioventricular block is
..
.. not uncommon in patients with atrioventricular septal defects and
..
.. patients with congenitally corrected transposition of the great
.. arteries.12 Therefore, if a young adult presents with AVB, CHD
..
... should be excluded by echocardiography. In emergency situations,
.. drug therapy with atropine and percutaneous/transvenous pacing
.. should be initiated. Drugs leading to bradycardia should be discontin..
.. ued (Figure 1). It is important to outline that in some ACHD patients
..
.. (e.g. Fontan), a transvenous approach does not allow access to a ven.. tricle and a retrograde transaortic approach may be required in the
..
.. emergency setting, followed by epicardial pacing. Moreover, perman.. ent transvenous pacing may increase the risk of systemic emboli in
..
. adults with intracardiac shunts (especially cyanotic patients).

Heart failure
General remarks
Common symptoms at presentation include acute or recent onset
dyspnoea, peripheral oedema, ascites, and/or exercise intolerance,
depending on the type of haemodynamic lesion and ventricular function. In patients presenting to the ED after recent surgery or interventions, late complications of the intervention/surgery should be
excluded, including infection, pericardial or pleural effusions, dislocation of percutaneous devices, pacemaker dysfunction, etc.

Assessment
In the emergency setting, physical examination, chest X-ray, and thoracic ultrasound are helpful in identifying lung congestion or infection,
pleural effusions, and cardiomegaly. Echocardiography is essential to
exclude a pericardial effusion, assess ventricular function, valve disease or obstructive lesions as well as PH; this should ideally be interpreted by an experienced ACHD operator, with good knowledge of
the patient's background anatomy and history.
Management depends on past medical history, including primary
diagnosis, previous interventions, residual lesion(s), and medication
(including recent medication changes). Investigations to exclude precipitating factors like arrhythmia, arterial hypertension, pulmonary
embolism, ischaemic heart disease, infection, anaemia, and thyroid
dysfunction, are then tailored accordingly.

Management
Medical management depends on the mechanisms precipitating HF
and includes early cardioversion for arrhythmias, diuretics for symptom and oedema relief, vasodilators, inotropes, and, in more
advanced cases, ventilatory and cardiovascular support (e.g. venousarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) for critical cardiovascular decompensation and shock (Figure 2).13,14
Patients presenting in cardiogenic shock require immediate support based on the ABC protocol (protecting airway, breathing, and

.. circulation), while other investigations are performed and ACHD ex...
.. pertise is sought. Arrangements should be made to transfer patients
.. to a tertiary ACHD centre with possibilities for circulatory support,
..
.. as soon as possible.
..
..
..
.. Chest pain
..
..
.. General remarks and assessment
..
.. All ACHD patients presenting to the ED with chest pain need careful
.. evaluation that should include a thorough medical history, including
..
.. the type and location of pain, physical examination, ECG, and echo.. cardiography. Computed tomography (CT) or other advanced imag..
.. ing may also be required. The differential diagnosis should include
.. myocardial ischaemia, aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism, PH as
..
.. well as lung infections. Coronary compression often presents with
.. recurrent chest pain on effort, which may be typical or atypical and
..
.. difficult to interpret in the presence of other significant symptoms or
..
.. severe exercise limitation.
..
..
.. Coronary anomalies
.. Abnormal coronary anatomy can be present, e.g. in patients with a
..
.. systemic right ventricle (Mustard/Senning operation for transposition
.. of the great arteries or congenitally corrected transposition) resulting
..
.. in an imbalance between myocardial perfusion and oxygen demand.
.. The right ventricle is supported by only one coronary artery and the
..
.. demand is markedly increased due to hypertrophy and dilatation of
..
15
.. the systemic right ventricle. Abnormal coronary anatomy is also
.. encountered in other types of CHD.
..
Furthermore, previous surgery (e.g. ToF correction, arterial switch
..
.. for transposition of the great arteries, Ross operation, David oper..
.. ation, correction of anomalous origin of the left or right coronary ar.. tery from the pulmonary artery, etc.), may have caused coronary
..
.. artery injury, and some patients may be at higher risk of developing
.. coronary problems. Coronary angiography (invasive or CT) plays an

important role in the management of ACHD patients presenting
with chest pain. It is helpful in excluding atherosclerotic disease, coronary anomalies as well as coronary complications related to previous surgery, albeit tertiary expertise may be required for
interpretation.

Other causes

Pulmonary arterial hypertension
General remarks
Between 5% and 10% of ACHD patients have PH, either post-capillary (due to left heart disease) or less commonly pre-capillary
(PAH).17,18

Symptoms
Patients with PAH related to CHD (PAH-CHD) can present acutely
with a variety of symptoms, including syncope, haemoptysis, HF, palpitations, and chest pain.
Syncope on effort reflects their inability to increase pulmonary
blood flow and cardiac output adequately and is a sign of advanced or
advancing PAH disease. Precipitants may include ventricular or supraventricular arrhythmia (in patients with impaired right ventricular
function), dehydration, medication, excessive effort, pregnancy, and
infection.19,20
Haemoptysis in PAH patients can be mild to severe and can become life-threatening, requiring volume repletion, correction of clotting factors, maintaining appropriate haemoglobin levels, as well as
advanced resuscitation with cardiovascular and respiratory support.

Management
Patients with haemoptysis should be turned lying on the side of the
bleeding lung and dual lumen or deep endotracheal intubation may
be required to protect the unaffected lung. Angiography may be useful with selective vessel closure when relevant bleeding does not
stop spontaneously. Patients presenting with severe HF or cardiogenic shock (e.g. due to a PH crisis or advanced PAH) may require
advanced cardiorespiratory support and/or treatment with inotropes
and pulmonary vasodilators (e.g. nitric oxide and/or intravenous epoprostenol), with careful adjustment of central venous pressure to optimize cardiac output. Noradrenaline may be needed in case of
hypotension to maintain myocardial perfusion. Pulmonary arterial
hypertension therapies should never be interrupted suddenly, especially parenteral prostanoids, because this can lead to a sudden

The risk of aortic dissection is elevated not only in patients with
Marfan syndrome or other hereditary thoracic aortic syndromes
(high risk) but also in patients with a bicuspid aortic valve (lower
risk).16 The risk of thromboembolism, including pulmonary emboli, is
increased in patients with a Fontan operation and in other complex
and/or cyanotic CHD. Furthermore, rare late complications after
interventional procedures like erosion of an atrial septal defect
occluder can occur.
Pulmonary hypertension can also be the cause of chest pain. Both
pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and elevated pulmonary
pressures due to systemic ventricular dysfunction or valve disease
should be included in the differential diagnosis (Figure 3).

circuit; in such cases, a CT scan may be necessary keeping in mind the
different anatomy, which may require a different CT protocol (e.g.
dual source of pulmonary blood flow in patients with a bidirectional
Glenn anastomosis).25,26

Management
All cyanotic patients should be aware of their baseline haemoglobin
concentration and report this to the emergency staff, to aid in the interpretation of laboratory findings. They should also be aware of the
need for intravenous line filters to avoid paradoxical air emboli.
Finally, all cyanotic patients, with or without PH, are at increased risk
of complications from invasive interventions, especially if general anaesthesia or sedation is required.

Infection
General remarks
The risk of infective endocarditis (IE) is substantially higher in ACHD
patients compared to the general population, with marked variation
in risk between lesions.27 Congenital heart disease can also be part of
the clinical spectrum of syndromes, such as functional asplenia in

.. heterotaxy (isomerism) and DiGeorge syndrome, commonly associ..
.. ated with immunodeficiency and, hence, susceptibility to systemic
..
.. infections.
..
..
.. Assessment
..
.. The diagnosis of IE is mainly based on history, imaging findings (echo.. cardiography and in selected cases positron emission tomography-
..
.. CT) and positive blood cultures (Figure 5).28
..
It should be kept in mind that IE in ACHD patients often affects
..
.. the right heart structures (e.g. pulmonary valve and valve replace..
.. ments, conduits, etc.). Furthermore, if an extracardiac infection has
.. an unusual prolonged course, the possibility of secondary IE should
..
.. be kept in mind. If an ACHD patient presents with signs of severe in.. fection to the ED, the threshold for further investigations as well as
..
.. contacting the regional ACHD centre should be low, and admission
..
.. to hospital is often necessary. Antibiotics should be started as soon
.. as two blood cultures are taken.
..
Especially, if a patient presents with signs of infection shortly after
..
.. surgery, besides IE other possible diagnoses to consider are wound
..
.. infections, lower respiratory tract infections, pleural effusions, and
.. mediastinitis.

2534

Wound complications after
surgery
General remarks

Assessment
The diagnosis of these problems can be made from a thorough review of the medical history and full physical examination. The inspection can reveal redness or dehiscence of the wound, pain on
palpation, sternal crepitation indicating fracture, and the presence of
protruding steel wires with or without a foreign body granuloma or
skin perforation.
Sternal swab, blood tests including procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, and blood cultures in case of fever should be requested. Chest
X-ray and thoracic CT scan are necessary in case of suspected mediastinitis, the presence of sternal crepitations, and in the case of protruding steel wire that may also cause cardiac tamponade. Patients
should have an older photo of their wound on their mobile phone to
share with the ED staff as a baseline.

Management
In case of significant wound problem, prompt referral to cardiac surgery is recommended (ideally to the centre that performed surgery)
(Figure 6).

Conclusions
Adult congenital heart disease represents an important field with
patients increasingly requiring acute ED care. Comprehensive ED
management requires a profound understanding of the most common clinical scenarios, which in turn is paramount for improving morbidity and mortality in this growing adult patient population.
Emergency department care providers should have basic ACHD
training, follow current recommendations for initial management and
should have direct access to ACHD tertiary advice (Graphical
abstract).

Emergency department visits related to surgical wound problems are
relatively rare, especially late after cardiac surgery. The most frequent
causes are (i) wound infection, with or without mechanical sternal instability, (ii) sternal fractures, and (iii) problems related to protruding
sternal wires. The main risk factor for the first two scenarios is diabetes, and additionally the use of a retraction device for exposure of
internal mammary artery harvesting for the second scenario (rare in
ACHD patients).29,30
