This Issue opens with the Special Article 'European Heart Journal
quality standards', authored by Fernando Alfonso from the
Hospital Universitario de La Princesa in Madrid, Spain, and colleagues.1 The authors note that the aim of the European Heart Journal
(EHJ) is to attract innovative, methodologically sound, and clinically
relevant research manuscripts able to change clinical practice and/or
substantially advance knowledge on cardiovascular diseases. As the
reference journal in cardiovascular medicine, the EHJ is committed to
publishing only the best cardiovascular science adhering to the highest ethical principles. EHJ uses highly rigorous peer review, critical
statistical review, and the highest quality editorial process to ensure
the novelty, accuracy, quality, and relevance of all accepted manuscripts with the aim of inspiring the clinical practice of EHJ readers
and reducing the global burden of cardiovascular diseases. This contribution summarizes the quality standards followed by the EHJ in
pursuit of its mission.
The Issue continues with a Focus on ischaemic heart disease. The
benefits of regular physical exercise on the human body are multiple
and indisputable. The improvements in cardiovascular risk profile
associated with exercise are partly secondary to its positive impact
on atherosclerotic risk factors such as blood pressure, lipid profile,
body mass index, and insulin resistance.2,3 In sharp contrast, extreme
strenuous and exhaustive exercise increases oxidative stress and can
result in a systemic inflammatory response, although this is usually
short-lived and resolves within a few hours. In a State of the Art
Review entitled 'The heart of the ageing endurance athlete:
the role of chronic coronary stress', Gemma Parry-Williams
from George's University of London in the UK and colleagues note
that current guidelines recommend at least 150 min of moderate

exercise or 75 min of vigorous exercise per week.4 Endurance athletes perform exercise at a level that is 10- to 20-fold greater than
these recommendations. These athletes reveal several structural and
functional cardiac adaptations, including increased cardiac size,
enhanced ventricular filling, and augmentation of stroke volume even
at the highest heart rates. The long-term effects of endurance exercise on the heart are unknown. Endurance exercise is associated with
a transient increase in serum concentrations of biomarkers of cardiac
damage and ventricular dysfunction which improves within 72 h.
Over the past decade, there have been emerging studies reporting
attenuated mortality benefit amongst individuals who perform the
highest volume of exercise. Studies in life-long male athletes aged
above 40 years old show a higher prevalence of high coronary artery
calcium scores (>300 Agatston units), a higher coronary plaque burden, and myocardial fibrosis compatible with subclinical myocardial
infarction compared with relatively sedentary healthy controls, raising speculation that life-long intense exercise imposes chronic coronary stress on the heart (Figure 1). This review article provides a
critical analysis of the existing data.
Colchicine is a unique, sophisticated anti-inflammatory agent that
has been used for decades for the prevention of acute inflammatory
flares in gout and familial Mediterranean fever, and in recent years trials have demonstrated its potential in a range of cardiovascular conditions.5,6 In another State of the Art Review entitled 'Colchicine and
the heart', Massimo Imazio from the University Hospital 'Santa
Maria della Misericordia' in Udine, Italy, and colleagues note that colchicine is avidly taken up by leucocytes, where its binding to tubulin
interferes with microtubular function, affecting the expression of
cytokines and interleukins as well as the ability of leucocytes to
marginate, aggregate, express superoxide, release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), and interact with platelets.7 In patients with
acute and recurrent pericarditis, clinical trials in >1600 patients have

consistently demonstrated that colchicine halves the risk of recurrence. In patients with acute and chronic coronary syndromes, multicentre randomized controlled trials in >11 000 patients followed for
up to 5 years demonstrate that it may reduce the risk of cardiiovascular death, myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke, and ischaemiadriven revascularization by >30%. Use of colchicine at doses of 0.5-
1.0 mg daily in cardiovascular trials has proved safe. Early gastrointestinal intolerance limits its use in 10% of patients; however, 90% of
patients tolerate it well over the long term. Despite isolated case
reports, clinically relevant drug interactions with moderate to strong
CYP3A4 inhibitors/competitors or P-glycoprotein inhibitors/competitors are rare, when colchicine is used at these doses, in the absence of advanced renal or liver disease. This review summarizes the
contemporary data supporting the efficacy and safety of colchicine in
patients with cardiovascular disease.
In a provocative Viewpoint article entitled 'Coronary artery disease: "gout" in the artery?', Timo E. Strandberg from the
University of Helsinki in Finland, and colleagues note that in a 'system
biology perspective', inflammation and its potential triggers are unifying factors in the pathophysiology of both gout and atherosclerotic
cardiovascular diseases (ASCVD).8-10 Furthermore, therapies to diminish the crystal-induced inflammation with canakinumab or colchicine have been shown to prevent the respective clinical
presentations, especially the acute ones.11 A final common similarity
is that the root causes-hyperuricaemia in gout and hypercholesterolaemia in ASCVD-must be effectively addressed to attain the best
results for patients in the long term.

Recent randomized trials demonstrated a benefit of low-dose colchicine added to guideline-based treatment in patients with
ASCVD.12,13 In a clinical research article entitled 'Efficacy and
safety of low-dose colchicine in patients with coronary disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized
trials', Aernoud Fiolet from the University Medical Centre Utrecht
in the Netherlands, and colleagues performed a systematic review
and meta-analysis to obtain best estimates of the effects of colchicine
on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE).14 The authors
searched the literature for randomized clinical trials of long-term colchicine in patients with atherosclerosis published up to 1 September
2020. The primary efficacy endpoint was MACE, the composite of
myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death. The authors
combined the results of five trials that included 11 816 patients. The
primary endpoint occurred in 578 patients. Colchicine reduced the
risk for the primary endpoint by 25% [relative risk (RR) 0.75;
P = 0.005], myocardial infarction by 22% (RR 0.78, P = 0.010), stroke
by 46% (RR 0.54; P = 0.009), and coronary revascularization by 23%
(RR 0.77; P < 0.001). They observed no difference in all-cause death
[RR 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71-1.62; P = 0.73], with a
lower incidence of cardiovascular death (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.55-1.23;
P = 0.34) counterbalanced by a higher incidence of noncardiovascular death (RR 1.38, 95% CI 0.99-1.92; P = 0.060)
(Figure 2).
The authors conclude that their meta-analysis indicates that
low-dose colchicine reduces the risk of MACE as well as that of
myocardial infarction and stroke, and the need for coronary

cardiovascular benefit from anti-inflammatory therapies, but the
authors do not minimize the finding of excess non-cardiovascular
mortality in these trials, and rightly so. This early signal of benefit
and possible signal of harm require further scrutiny from

forthcoming controlled clinical trials expected to enrol >12 000
participants, a doubling of exposed individuals, that will permit
safety analysis in diverse clinical settings. The results of
CONVINCE (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02898610) and CLEARSYNERGY (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03048825), two large, long-term
studies in secondary prevention, are needed to convince critics
and clear up unresolved issues with respect to non-cardiovascular
mortality and, importantly, to gather data in female and minority
patients before the use of colchicine is more broadly endorsed.
Until those studies are completed, further efforts to identify population segments at potentially elevated risk and those potentially
deriving greater drug-derived benefit would add to the body of
evidence available for risk-benefit profiling.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are lipid bilayer-delimited, non-replicating particles released from different subcellular compartments. They
can be classified on the basis of a physical characteristic, such as density or size or the cell/condition of origin-for example, platelet EVs,
hypoxic EVs, or apoptotic bodies.16,17 Moreover, because EVs originate from various cell types, they acquire specific antigens expressed
by the cell of origin, in addition to negatively charged phospholipids
and membrane-associated glycoproteins. Therefore, they can also be
classified on the basis of their biochemical composition. EVs play a
role in the intercellular communication pathways occurring among
cells of the same as well as of different cell types. EVs, together with
proteins, peptides, lipids, and non-coding RNAs, are part of the cellular secretome. Once released, EVs influence the surrounding environment through their cargo of active biomolecules, such as proteins,
mRNAs, microRNAs, and lipids. Increased shedding of EVs has been
associated with atherosclerosis, but whether this is true for myocardial diseases is still poorly known. In a translational research article
entitled 'Myocardial hypoxic stress mediates functional cardiac extracellular vesicle release', Achille Anselmo from the
IRCCS-Humanitas Research Hospital in Rozzano, Italy, and colleagues used the surface antigen CD172a as a specific marker of cardiomyocyte (CM)-derived EVs; the CM origin of CD172ath EVs was
supported by their content of cardiac-specific proteins and heartenriched microRNAs.18 The authors found that patients with aortic
stenosis, ischaemic heart disease, or cardiomyopathy had higher circulating CD172ath cardiac EV counts than did healthy subjects.
Cellular stress was a major determinant of EV release from CMs,
with hypoxia increasing shedding in in vitro and in vivo experiments. At
the functional level, EVs isolated from the supernatant of CMs
derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and cultured in a hypoxic atmosphere elicited a positive inotropic response
in unstressed CMs, an effect the authors found to be dependent on
an increase in the number of EVs expressing ceramide on their surface. Of potential clinical relevance, aortic stenosis patients with the
highest counts of circulating cardiac CD172ath EVs had a more favourable prognosis for transcatheter aortic valve replacement than
those with lower counts.
Anselmo et al. conclude that they identify circulating CD172ath
EVs as cardiac derived, showing their release and function, and providing evidence for their prognostic potential in aortic stenosis
patients. The manuscript is accompanied by an Editorial by Chantal
Boulanger from the Universite de Paris, and colleagues.19 The
authors conclude that future pre-clinical animal models allowing EV
tracking in vivo are much needed to finally demonstrate how the diseased part of the myocardium sends specific messages to the healthy
part of the muscle in order to boost its contractile function.
Certainly, the study by Anselmo et al. highlights EVs released from
the myocardium as previously unsuspected 'spurs for a tired horse'.
The issue is also complemented by various Discussion Forum contributions. In a commentary entitled 'Colchicine and coronary artery disease: a virtuous adoption', Filippo Angelini and
colleagues from the University of Turin in Italy comment on the recent publication 'Time-to-treatment initiation of colchicine
and cardiovascular outcomes after myocardial infarction in
the Colchicine Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial (COLCOT)'
