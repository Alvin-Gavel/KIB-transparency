Aims

Despite considerable therapeutic advances, there is still a dearth of evidence on the molecular determinants of cardiac hypertrophy that culminate in heart failure. Neuraminidases are a family of enzymes that catalyze the
cleavage of terminal sialic acids from glycoproteins or glycolipids. This study sought to characterize the role of neuraminidases in pathological cardiac hypertrophy and identify pharmacological inhibitors targeting mammalian
neuraminidases.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
Neuraminidase 1 (NEU1) was highly expressed in hypertrophic hearts of mice and rats, and this elevation was confirmed in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (n = 7) compared with healthy controls (n = 7). The increased
and results

NEU1 was mainly localized in cardiomyocytes by co-localization with cardiac troponin T. Cardiomyocyte-specific
NEU1 deficiency alleviated hypertrophic phenotypes in response to transverse aortic constriction or isoproterenol
hydrochloride infusion, while NEU1 overexpression exacerbated the development of cardiac hypertrophy.
Mechanistically, co-immunoprecipitation coupled with mass spectrometry, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and
luciferase assays demonstrated that NEU1 translocated into the nucleus and interacted with GATA4, leading to
Foetal gene (Nppa and Nppb) expression. Virtual screening and experimental validation identified a novel compound C-09 from millions of compounds that showed favourable binding affinity to human NEU1 (KD = 0.38 lM)
and effectively prevented the development of cardiac remodelling in cellular and animal models. Interestingly, antiinfluenza drugs zanamivir and oseltamivir effectively inhibited mammalian NEU1 and showed new indications of cardio-protection.

Conclusions
This work identifies NEU1 as a critical driver of cardiac hypertrophy and inhibition of NEU1 opens up an entirely
new field of treatment for cardiovascular diseases.

Translational perspective
This work identified neuraminidase 1 (NEU1) as a crucial inducer of cardiac hypertrophy using different models ranging from rodents
to humans. Inhibiting NEU1 opens up an entirely new field of treatment for cardiovascular diseases. Compound-09 was screened as a
novel candidate compound that specifically targets human NEU1 and attenuates cardiac remodelling. The existing anti-viral drugs (zanamivir and oseltamivir) with well-established safety and pharmacokinetic profiles show novel indications for cardiovascular diseases.

Introduction
Pathological cardiac hypertrophy, characterized by myocyte enlargement and dysfunctional cardiac contractility, is a hallmark of numerous cardiovascular diseases.1 Hypertrophic transformation is viewed
as a fundamental and indispensable step in myocardial response to
pressure overload. In the long term, myocardial hypertrophy is a
major predisposing factor for heart failure, arrhythmia, and sudden
death.2 Increasing body of evidence shows that inhibiting such hypertrophy is beneficial for preventing its transition to heart failure.3
Molecular mechanisms contributing to the development of cardiac
hypertrophy and heart failure are very complex.3,4 The hypertrophic
process involves a vast array of structure, calcium handling, metabolism, gene transcription, inflammation, autophagy, and other functional
events within the growing cell.5-9 Pharmacotherapy targeting cardiomyocyte cell-surface neurohormones and receptors are effective in
limiting progression of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure, including b-adrenergic receptor blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers.10,11 Despite considerable therapeutic advances, there is still a dearth of evidence on the
molecular determinants of cardiac hypertrophy that culminate in decompensated heart failure.

Characterization of new signalling mediators associated with cardiac hypertrophy and remodelling is a key focus in the exploration of
novel drug targets that improve clinical outcomes. Neuraminidases
(NEUs), also known as sialidases, are a family of enzymes that cleave
sialic acid on the surfaces of cells.12 The functions of viral NEUs have
been well documented in the influenza virus replication.13 The biological effects of mammalian NEUs, however, tend to be underestimated and are less characterized. Mammalian NEUs catalyze the
cleavage of terminal sialic acids from glycoproteins or glycolipids.12
Four types of mammalian NEUs (NEU1, NEU2, NEU3, and NEU4)
have been identified to date, differing in their subcellular localization
and enzymatic properties.12 Of these, NEU1 is the most abundantly
expressed. In addition to its typical catabolic function in lysosomes,
NEU1 can also translocate to the cell surface, where it is involved in
structural and functional modulation of cellular receptors. Some
examples of receptors and cellular signalling modulated by NEU1
desialylation at cell membrane include TLR4-NFjB-associated response, insulin receptor-related glucose uptake, Fc receptors for immunoglobulin G in macrophage phagocytosis, and epidermal growth
factor receptor and insulin-like growth factor-2 in proliferation.14-18
With regard to the effects of NEU1 in cardiovascular diseases, a
few studies have focused on blood vessel disorders such as

Results
Neuraminidase 1 is elevated in
cardiomyocytes of hypertrophic hearts in
rodents and humans
Neuraminidase 1 expression was significantly elevated in hypertrophic heart tissue of mice in response to TAC stimulation (Figure 1A).
The expressions of other three isoforms (NEU2, NEU3, and NEU4)
were not altered markedly between the sham and TAC groups
(Figure 1A). The increased level of NEU1 was replicated in two rat
models of TAC- and ISO-induced hypertrophy by western blots

(Figure 1B). Immunohistochemistry further confirmed the increased
NEU1 (Figure 1C), in which IgG was used as the negative control to
exclude non-specific staining (Supplementary material online, Figure
S1A). The NEU activity was elevated in TAC- or ISO-induced hypertrophic hearts compared with the control as a result (Figure 1D).
Healthy controls and diseased patients are the most appropriate
subjects to obtain tissue samples for target discovery. We analysed
14 human heart samples collected from subjects with normal cardiac
function (n = 7) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (n = 7). Detailed
information of human heart samples is provided in Supplementary
material online, Table S1. Western blots and immunohistochemistry
revealed that NEU1 protein levels in the patients were significantly
higher than the healthy controls (Figure 1E and F).
The elevated NEU1 was mainly localized in cardiomyocytes based
on co-localization with cardiac troponin T (Figure 1G). Non-specific
staining was excluded by co-staining with IgG and alpha-sarcomeric
actinin (Supplementary material online, Figure S1B). We further compared NEU1 expression in cardiomyocytes and non-cardiomyocytes
of heart tissue from mice subjected to TAC. The NEU1 mRNA
(Supplementary material online, Figure S1C) and protein expression
(Figure 1H) were markedly increased in the cardiomyocyte fraction
and not the non-cardiomyocyte fraction.

Neuraminidase 1 promotes
cardiomyocyte hypertrophy at the
cellular level
We isolated NRCMs (Figure 2A) and observed that NEU1 expression
was increased in response to Ang II treatment (Figure 2B and C).
Knockdown of NEU1 (Figure 2D-F) notably ameliorated Ang IIinduced NEU enzyme activation, sialic acid releasing, and cardiomyocyte enlargement compared with the negative controls (Figure 2G-I).
Hypertrophic markers Nppa, Nppb, and Myh7 were also significantly
decreased (Figure 2J). Conversely, NEU1 overexpression without any
pathological stimulus up-regulated enzyme activity, sialic acid level,
the expression of Nppa, Nppb, and Myh7, and induced cardiomyocyte
enlargement (Supplementary material online, Figure S2).

Neu1CKO alleviates cardiac hypertrophy
and remodelling in mice
To explore the function of NEU1 in vivo, we generated mice with cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of NEU1 using a Cre/loxP-dependent
conditional gene-targeting approach. Mice homozygous for the
Neu1-loxp (fl)-targeted allele (Neu1fl/fl) were crossed with cardiomyocyte-specific tamoxifen-inducible Myh6 Cre lines (Supplementary material online, Figure S3A and B). The mRNA, protein, and
enzyme activity of NEU1 were efficiently deleted from the hearts of
Myh6-Cre, Neu1fl/fl mice (Neu1 conditional knockout, Neu1CKO)
(Supplementary material online, Figure S3C-E). Immunofluorescence
results showed that NEU1 was significantly knocked down in the cardiomyocytes (Supplementary material online, Figure S3F). These mice
and their age-matched Neu1fl/fl littermates without Cre recombinase
activity (control mice) were then challenged with TAC surgery
(Figure 3A). The Neu1-deleted group showed a significantly ameliorated phenotype with reduced heart size, heart weight, and lung
weight (Figure 3B and C; Supplementary material online, Figure S4A
and B). Cardiac sections stained with wheat germ agglutinin (WGA)

atherosclerosis.19 Neuraminidase 1 was highly expressed in monocytes and macrophages, promoting atherosclerosis, and plaque inflammation.20 Down-regulation of NEU1 reduced very-low-density
lipoprotein and attenuated atherosclerosis.20,21 Investigations on the
effects of NEU1 in cardiomyocytes are very few. A recent published
study demonstrated that an up-regulation of NEU1 in invading monocytes and macrophages after ischaemia/reperfusion contributed to
heart failure by promoting inflammation.22 It is well known that cardiomyocytes account for >50% of an adult human heart ventricular region, much higher than the 3% for cardiac monocytes and
macrophages.23 This therefore begs the question, 'what role does
the cardiomyocyte-localized NEU1 play in cardiac hypertrophy and
remodelling?'. Compared with the ischaemia-induced model such as
ischaemia/reperfusion, the activation of the immune system is less robust in non-ischaemic cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure models.24 Selective depletion of mononuclear phagocytes in pressure
overload-induced heart failure had no obvious effects on subsequent
cardiac remodelling or dysfunction.25 From this point, long-term
pressure-overload stimulation seems to be an ideally experimental
non-ischaemic model to characterize the role of cardiomyocytelocalized NEU1 in cardiac hypertrophy.
Here, we proposed the hypothesis that cardiomyocyte-localized
NEU1 is a mediator of pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy. We employed several experimental models in mice and rats
using long-term transverse aortic constriction (TAC) or isoproterenol hydrochloride (ISO) infusion. The increased level of
NEU1 was further confirmed in heart tissues of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. We used neonatal rat primary cardiomyocytes (NRCMs) in response to angiotensin II (Ang II) stimulation, a
commonly used stimulator to induce cardiac hypertrophy through
angiotensin II type 1 receptors26 to study the effects of cardiomyocyte-localized NEU1 and its underlying mechanism. To explore the
function of cardiomyocyte-localized NEU1 in vivo, we further generated cardiomyocyte-specific NEU1 knockout and overexpression
mice. Subsequently, novel compounds targeting mammalian NEU1
were screened to effectively prevent cardiac hypertrophy.
Additionally, we tested new indications for viral NEU inhibitors in
cardio-protection.

Neuraminidase 1 overexpression
promotes cardiac hypertrophy and
remodelling in mice
Besides loss-of-function, a gain-of-function approach was performed
using adeno-associated virus serotype 9 encoding NEU1 (AAV9NEU1) and AAV9-Ctrl (Supplementary material online, Figure S6A).
The mRNA, protein, and enzyme activity of NEU1 were significantly
increased in cardiomyocytes after injection of AAV9-NEU1 for
4 weeks (Supplementary material online, Figure S6B-E). The immunofluorescence results showed that AAV9-NEU1 was transduced into
cardiomyocytes (Supplementary material online, Figure S6F). We
investigated the effects of NEU1 overexpression on cardiac hypertrophic phenotypes in mice under both pathological and physiological
conditions (Supplementary material online, Figure S6G). As expected,
NEU1 overexpression aggravated the development of TAC-stimulated cardiac hypertrophy and remodelling (Supplementary material
online, Figure S7). Surprisingly, under physiological condition without

..
.. any pathological stimulus, NEU1 overexpression for 13 weeks led to
.. significant increase in heart size, heart weight, and cardiomyocyte
..
.. cross-sectional area (Figure 4A-D). Echocardiography indicated that
.. NEU1 overexpression triggered slight myocardial injury at 8 weeks
..
.. (Supplementary material online, Figure S8), and significant ventricular
.. thickening and cardiac dysfunction at 13 weeks (Figure 4E-G,
..
.. Supplementary material online, Figure S9). In addition, cardiac hyper.. trophy foetal gene and fibrosis markers were also significantly up..
.. regulated in hearts of mice subjected to NEU1 overexpression for
.. 13 weeks (Figure 4H-J). These results suggest that cardiomyocyte..
.. specific NEU1 overexpression promotes cardiac hypertrophy and
..
.. remodelling under both pathological and physiological conditions.
..
..
.. Neuraminidase 1 interacts with GATA4
.. in the nucleus
..
.. To investigate the underlying mechanism by which NEU1 promotes

.. cardiac damage, we determined the subcellular localization of NEU1
.. in cardiomyocytes. Of note, we observed that NEU1 is able to trans..
.. locate into the nucleus in response to pressure overload, as meas.. ured by subcellular fractionation and immunofluorescence imaging
..
.. (Figure 5A-C). This observation is different from the generally held
.. view that NEU1 is located in the lysosome.15
..
..
To identify potential NEU1-interacting proteins in the nucleus, the
.. nuclear protein extraction of NRCMs was co-immunoprecipitated
..
.. with an anti-NEU1 antibody. The immunoprecipitate was analysed by
.. liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (Supplementary

..
.. between GATA4 and the promoter of Nppa or Nppb are evolution.. arily conserved (Supplementary material online, Figure S10B). We
..

.. Figure S10C). Surface plasmon resonance indicated that NEU1 exhib.. ited strong binding affinity to GATA4 with an estimated equilibrium

.. dissociation constant of 0.35 nM, suggesting that NEU1 directly tar.. gets GATA4 (Figure 5F). The interaction between NEU1 and PURA is
..
.. too weak to fit the equilibrium dissociation constant (Supplementary

..

.. not bind to MYOCARDIN, MYOGENIN, SRF, MEF2C, and MYOD1
..
.. (Supplementary material online, Figure S10E). These results suggest

showed that Neu1 deficiency decreased cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area (Figure 3B and D). Echocardiography indicated that the
hearts of Neu1CKO mice developed less dilation and dysfunction
after TAC based on analysis of interventricular septum diameter in
diastole (IVSd), interventricular septum diameter in systole (IVSs),
left ventricular posterior wall diameter in diastole (LVPWd), left ventricular posterior wall diameter in systole (LVPWs), ejection fraction
(EF), left ventricular mass, and fractional shortening (FS) (Figure 3E
and F; Supplementary material online, Figure S4C-F). Transverse aortic
constriction surgery appeared not to affect diastolic function in terms
of E/A and left ventricular isovolumic relaxation time (Supplementary
material online, Figure S4G and H). The TAC-induced foetal gene
expressions were greatly down-regulated in the hearts of the
Neu1CKO mice compared with control (Figure 3G). Heart sections
were stained with Masson to evaluate the degrees of fibrosis. The
results revealed that cardiac fibrosis was improved in Neu1CKO
mice compared with control (Figure 3H). The markers of fibrosis
were also significantly down-regulated in Neu1CKO mice (Figure 3I).
Additionally, RT-qPCR showed that NEU1 knockdown inhibited
TAC-induced IL-6, TNF-a, and IL-1b increase (Supplementary material
online, Figure S4I-K). TUNEL assay showed that NEU1 knockdown
reduced TAC-induced apoptosis rates (Supplementary material online, Figure S4L). Isolectin B4 staining showed that capillary density
was not altered by TAC stimulation or NEU1 knockdown
(Supplementary material online, Figure S4M).
In another hypertrophic model induced by ISO (Supplementary
material online, Figure S5A), Neu1CKO mice also showed significantly
improved cardiac hypertrophy (Supplementary material online, Figure
S5B-E) and ventricular thickening (Supplementary material online,
Figure S5F and G). Cardiac function-associated EF and FS showed no
significant alteration in ISO-induced Neu1CKO mice (Supplementary
material online, Figure S5H and I). Hypertrophic and fibrosis marker
gene expression were moderately reduced in Neu1CKO mice compared with littermate controls (Supplementary material online, Figure
S5J and K). Apoptosis rates of cardiomyocytes were reduced in
Neu1CKO mice (Supplementary material online, Figure S5L).
Capillary density was not changed by ISO stimulation or NEU1
knockdown (Supplementary material online, Figure S5M).

NEU1 promotes cardiac hypertrophy

C-09 is screened as a novel human
neuraminidase 1 inhibitor
As NEU1 is a potential target for pathological cardiac hypertrophy,
we proposed a computer-aided drug design strategy to screen novel
human NEU1 inhibitors. The strategy involves homology modelling,
molecular dynamics simulation, virtual screening, and experimental
validation (Figure 6A). Since the precise crystal structure of mammalian NEU1 is not reported yet, SWII-MODEL, a protein structure
homology modelling, was employed to produce the three-dimensional structure of human NEU1 based on the structure of influenza
A virus NEU. Molecular dynamics simulation was carried out to produce tens of thousands of time-dependent protein frames. Cluster
analysis showed the four dominant conformational states accounting
for 65%, 22%, 4%, and 3%, respectively. Molecular operating environment was used to dock 1.6 million compounds from the ChemDiv library into the most populated NEU1 structure and to score their
potential complementarity with putative binding sites. After docking,
the top 500 ligands based on the lowest binding energies were
selected for further analysis. Through inspecting the interaction patterns of each ligand with the binding and active sites at Arg78, Arg97,
Asp103, Glu264, Arg280, Arg341, Tyr370, and Glu394, 16 compounds (C-01 to C-16) that formed reasonable hydrogen bonds with
NEU1 were obtained. The binding modes of C-09 and C-12 with
NEU1 are shown in Figure 6B. The biolayer interferometry assay
(BLI) was performed to measure the binding ability of the two compounds with human recombinant NEU1. C-09 and C-12 showed
strong binding affinity to human recombinant NEU1 with the estimated equilibrium dissociation constant at 0.38 and 2.3 lM, respectively (Supplementary material online, Figure S11A and B).
In NRCMs, C-09 and C-12 showed protective effects on cardiomyocytes (Supplementary material online, Figure S11C-E). Next, we
studied the effects of the two compounds in mice with TAC-induced
cardiac hypertrophy (Figure 6C). C-09 but not C-12 effectively inhibited NEU enzyme activation in vivo (Supplementary material online,
Figure S11F). Of note, oral administration of C-09 (7.5 mg/kg/d) alleviated TAC-induced cardiac injury, with significantly improved heart
morphology and function (Figure 6D-F, Supplementary material online, Figure S11G-L). The Masson staining showed the extent of cardiac fibrosis was improved after C-09 treatment (Figure 6D and G).
RT-qPCR results demonstrated that the TAC-induced Nppa, Nppb,
Myh7, Col1a1, Col3a1, Ctgf, Lox, and Acta1 expressions were greatly
down-regulated in the hearts of C-09-treated mice (Figure 6H and I).

.. C-12 (7.5 mg/kg/d) showed moderate improvements in left ventricu.. lar mass, LVPWd, hypertrophic marker genes, and cardiac fibrosis,

online, Figure S10H and I). Luciferase reporter assays further showed
that NEU1 knockdown inhibited the GATA4-mediated Nppa and
Nppb transcription, while NEU1 overexpression significantly promoted GATA4-induced Nppa and Nppb transcriptions (Figure 5I,
Supplementary material online, Figure S10J and K). When GATA4
was knocked down (Supplementary material online, Figure S10L),
NEU1 overexpression-induced Nppa, Nppb, and Myh7 transcriptions
were blocked in cardiomyocyte (Supplementary material online,
Figure S10M-O), indicating that NEU1 promoted cardiac hypertrophy
in a GATA4 dependent manner. Mechanism-wise, NEU1 translocated into the nucleus in response to Ang II stimulation and selectively interacted with the transcriptional factor GATA4, promoting
hypertrophy-related gene transcription (Figure 5J).

cardiomyocytes (Supplementary material online, Figure S17A and B).
It was possible that activated NEU1 partly resulted from increased
cAMP levels. It was reported that NEU activity affected calcium handling of cardiomyocytes.36 In close agreement, by knockdown or
overexpression of NEU1, we found that NEU1 positively regulated
intracellular calcium levels in NRCMs (Supplementary material online, Figure S17C and D).
Given the critical role of NEU1 in cardiac hypertrophy and remodelling as characterized in this work, it is of importance to discover
novel human-specific and organ-specific inhibitors. Because of unavailability of the three-dimensional structure of human NEU1, very
few studies focus on designing human-specific NEU inhibitors. Based
on the influenza virus NEU structure and binding/active sites of
human NEU1, we developed a strategy to screen small-molecule
inhibitors of human NEU1. From millions of compounds, we discovered the novel compound C-09, showing favourable binding affinity
to NEU1 and significant protective effects against cardiac hypertrophy and remodelling through virtual screening and cellular/animal
validation. In terms of amino acid sequence, NEU2, NEU3, and NEU4
show large similarity, while NEU1 shares <10% identities. Since the
amino acid sequence of NEU1 is quite different from NEU2-NEU4,
we speculated that C-09 selectively inhibited NEU1 activity. The determination of the three-dimensional structure of the NEU1 and its
complex in the near future would contribute to the discovery of
stronger inhibitors and explain its interdependent mode of action.
Also, NEU1 inhibitors could complement existing therapies, such as
b-adrenergic receptor blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitors in an effort to efficiently treat heart failure.
Repositioning existing drugs for new indications has the potential
to shorten development timelines and lower overall costs. Use of
NEU inhibitors is recommended in expert consensus statement for
the treatment of fulminant myocarditis.37 In close with this, this work
showed that zanamivir and oseltamivir, two first-line anti-virus drugs,
effectively inhibited mammalian NEU enzyme. As a result, the two
drugs elicited cardio-protection against TAC- and ISO-induced cardiac damage. It is known that marked reduction in NEU1 activity
leads to sialidosis, an inherited disease characterized by coarse facial
features and developmental delay.38 As of now, there is no case report on sialidosis syndrome caused by oseltamivir or zanamivir use
for up to 6 weeks. We did not observe any side effects of oseltamivir,
zanamivir, and C-09 during the entire experimental period. Because
of their well-established safety and pharmacokinetic profiles, it looks
promising to repurpose anti-viral drugs for new indications of ischaemic and non-ischaemic cardiovascular diseases.
This study has some limitations. First, we observed that NEU1 expression in the nucleus was elevated in response to Ang II challenge.
Further investigations are required to address how NEU1 was elevated and how it translocated from the lysosome to the nucleus.
Second, in addition to acting as a co-activator to interact with transcriptional factor GATA4, NEU1 may also be involved in other signalling pathways or interact with other transcription factors that remain
to be investigated. Third, this work highlights a role for NEU1 in maladaptive hypertrophy. It is not clear whether NEU1 also plays a role
in adaptive hypertrophy. Fourth, some haemodynamic parameters
were not determined such as mean arterial pressure and systemic
vascular resistance of mice receiving ISO owing to our technical limitation. Fifth, because of lacking data on diastolic function in

new indications of cardio-protection for anti-influenza drugs (zanamivir and oseltamivir) that directly inhibited mammalian NEU1
(Graphical abstract).
We previously identified a role for the metabolic marker N-acetylneuraminic acid in acute myocardial ischaemia, and NEU1 was shown
to act as an upstream enzyme to regulate release of free N-acetylneuraminic acid.31 In this work, we explored the role of NEU1 in
pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy and remodelling.
Unlike from our previous findings, here, NEU1 plays a non-canonical
role as a co-activator to interact with transcriptional factors GATA4,
promoting cardiac hypertrophy and remodelling. This study combined with our previous work showed that NEU1 is a key driver of
cardiovascular disease, and is therefore a potential therapeutic target.
NEU1 was observed to be highly expressed in different immune
cell types, such as macrophages within atherosclerotic arteries, circulating monocytes, and invading monocytes/macrophages in the
heart.20,22 It has been reported that NEU1 is involved in the development of inflammatory responses and contributes to atherosclerosis
and heart failure.20,21 This work showed that cardiomyocyte-localized NEU1 was increased significantly in pressure overload-induced
cardiac hypertrophy in mice and rats and was confirmed in heart tissues of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Cardiomyocytespecific NEU1 knockout or overexpression effectively counteracted
or aggravated the development of TAC-stimulated cardiac hypertrophy and remodelling. Our findings suggest NEU1 in cardiomyocytes as an inducer of cardiac hypertrophy.
Mammalian NEU1 is typically located in the lysosome, where it has
a well-defined catabolic function in removing terminal sialic acid residues of glycoproteins and oligosaccharides by forming a multienzyme
complex along with b-galactosidase and protective protein/cathepsin
A (PPCA).12 In line with a previous report,22 we also found that
PPCA expression and the interstitial sialylglycoproteins were regulated by NEU1 (Supplementary material online, Figure S16). Emerging
data have demonstrated that NEU1 can be sorted to plasma membrane of many cell types upon activation.17-22 It thereby modulates
the structure and function of cellular receptors by desialylation.12
Interestingly, our work showed that NEU1 translocated into
the nucleus, and acted as a transcriptional co-activator. Co-immunoprecipitation
and
liquid
chromatography-tandem
mass
spectrometry identified a transcriptional factor GATA4 that strongly
binds to NEU1. Transcriptional factors and their cofactors are key
regulatory molecules in determining reactivation of cardiac hypertrophy-related 'Foetal genes', including Nppa, Nppb, and Myh7.32 The
zinc finger protein GATA4 is one such transcription factors, and a
number of its cofactors have been implicated in cardiac hypertrophy,
most notably Nkx-2.5, myocyte enhancer factor 2, and serum response factor.33,34 Our work showed that the binding of GATA4 to
the promoter region of Nppa and Nppb depended on NEU1, suggesting NEU1 is a novel co-transcriptional factor of GATA4.
Molecular mechanisms regarding the NEU1-involved cardiac
hypertrophy and heart failure are very complex. Interestingly, we
observed that NEU1 was up-regulated not only in nucleus but also in
cytoplasm in response to pressure overload. We cannot exclude the
fact that alteration of NEU1 in other subcellular organelles also contributes to cardiac hypertrophy. It has been reported that cAMP
enhanced ISO-stimulated sialidase activity.35 In line with this, we also
observed that the cAMP level was increased in hypertrophic

hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients, it is likely that the magnitude
of diastolic impairment has impact on myocardial molecular profile
investigated in cells and animal model. Sixth, we showed obvious cardio-protective effects for zanamivir and oseltamivir in animal models.
Repurposing this new medical indication for existing anti-viral drugs
requires clinical trials to confirm their efficacy.
In conclusion, this work identifies NEU1 as a critical driver of pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy by interacting with the
transcriptional factor GATA4 and inhibiting NEU1 opens up an entirely new field of treatment for cardiovascular diseases. It has the
clinical potential to develop small-molecule compounds targeting
human NEU1 and repurpose novel cardio-protective indications for
existing anti-viral drugs.
