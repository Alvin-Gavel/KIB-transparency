Aims

Digital therapeutics is a new approach to facilitate the non-pharmacological treatment of hypertension using software programmes such as smartphone applications and/or device algorithms. Based on promising findings from a
small pilot trial, the HERB Digital Hypertension 1 (HERB-DH1) pivotal trial investigated the efficacy of digital therapeutics in patients with hypertension not receiving antihypertensive medication.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
This prospective, open-label, randomized controlled study was performed at 12 sites in Japan. Patients with hyperand results
tension [office systolic blood pressure (SBP) 140 to <180 mmHg and 24 h SBP >_130 mmHg] were randomly
assigned 1:1 to the digital therapeutics group (HERB system th standard lifestyle modification) or control group
(standard lifestyle modification alone). The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change in 24 h ambulatory SBP
from baseline to 12 weeks; key secondary efficacy endpoints were mean changes in office and home blood pressure (BP) from baseline to 12 weeks. All analyses were conducted in the full analysis set population. Between
December 2019 and June 2020, 390 patients were randomly assigned to the digital therapeutics group (n = 199) or
control (n = 191) group. Between-group differences in 24-h ambulatory, home, and office SBPs at 12 weeks were
-2.4 (95% confidence interval -4.5 to -0.3), -4.3 (-6.7 to -1.9), and -3.6 (-6.2 to -1.0) mmHg, respectively. No major
programme-related safety events occurred up to 24 weeks.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
The HERB-DH1 pivotal study showed the superiority of digital therapeutics compared with standard lifestyle modification alone to reduce 24-h ambulatory, home, and office BPs in the absence of antihypertensive medications.

Introduction
Hypertension, especially uncontrolled hypertension, has a significant
negative impact on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.1,2 In fact,
high systolic blood pressure (SBP) is the leading modifiable contributor to the worldwide cardiovascular disease burden.3
Detection of high blood pressure (BP) and effective treatment
with dietary/lifestyle interventions and BP-lowering medications can
significantly reduce the risk of future cardiovascular events.4
However, despite the availability of a range of pharmacological therapy options for the management of raised BP, rates of achievement
of target BP levels and BP control remain suboptimal: from 30% to
85% of treated patients with hypertension fail to reach a BP management target of 140/90 mmHg, and rates of uncontrolled BP are even
higher when the lower threshold of 130/80 mmHg recommended by
the latest US guidelines is applied.5,6 In addition, 17-20% of
American adults with hypertension have resistant disease, defined as
a lack of BP control despite treatment with optimal dosages of >_3
antihypertensives from different drug classes.7,8 This highlights an unmet need for complementary approaches to optimize the management of hypertension.
Digital therapeutics refers to an emerging branch of medicine,
which utilizes technology-based software algorithms or applications
(apps) to facilitate disease management.9 Although there are a plethora of apps claiming to help manage hypertension, few have been
developed in collaboration with healthcare professionals or device

companies, and none have undergone rigorous scientific assessment
of clinical efficacy in patients with hypertension.10 Furthermore, the
data that are available are not consistent with respect to the effects
of digital therapeutics on BP levels and control.11
The HERB system is a new interactive smartphone app that is
designed to help users make intensive and consistent lifestyle modifications to reduce BP. It combines medically validated nonpharmacological interventions (including salt restriction, control of
body weight, regular exercise, and alcohol restriction) with behavioural science techniques.12 In addition, user input relating to personality,
behavioural characteristics, and hypertension determinants is applied
to personalize recommendations and strategies. This software system
was developed under expert guidance from Jichi Medical University,
Tochigi, Japan, and includes an app for use by patients with hypertension and a web application for healthcare providers (Figure 1).
A randomized, open-label pilot study confirmed the feasibility and
safety of the HERB system in patients with essential hypertension.13
Hypertension guidelines recommend 12 weeks of nonpharmacological therapy before drug initiation in treatment-naive
patients with hypertension.14 Therefore, this randomized, controlled
clinical trial [HERB Digital Hypertension 1 (HERB DH1) pivotal] was
designed to evaluate the 12-week efficacy and safety of digital therapeutics using the HERB system without medication (primary endpoint), and effects on 24-week endpoints after drug initiation was
permitted, in patients with essential hypertension not receiving
pharmacological antihypertensive therapy.15

Efficacy of a digital therapeutics system

Methods
Study design and oversight
The randomized, open-label HERB-DH1 study (jRCT2032190148) was
conducted at 12 study sites in Japan (Supplementary material online,
Table S1). Patients were recruited between December 2019 and June
2020 and then followed until December 2020. The study protocol was
approved by the Institutional Review Board at Jinbo Orthopedics
(Tokyo) and Jichi Medical University Hospital (Tochigi, Japan). The trial
was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice, the
Declaration of Helsinki, and all applicable laws and guidelines in Japan.

12 weeks. Patients with suspected secondary hypertension or who
required immediate antihypertensive medication due to medical history
or comorbidities were excluded.

Randomization and masking
Randomization (1:1) was performed automatically using the electronic
data capture system and used as an independent web-based block randomization system. Randomization was stratified by the following factors:
study centre, history of antihypertensive medication use (>_3 months previously), and 24-h SBP at baseline (>_145 or <145 mmHg).

All patients were provided with details on lifestyle modifications for the
management of hypertension, as recommended by the Japanese Society
of Hypertension (JSH).14 In the digital therapeutics group, patients also
received interactive support for intensive and consistent lifestyle modifications using the HERB Mobile system.15 Patients in the digital therapeutics group downloaded the app (HERB Mobile) through their
smartphones, activated the app by entering a prescription code, and input
their personal baseline profiles including age, sex, and their lifestyle, social
background, and behaviour patterns (these data were gathered through a
chat-bot with a virtual nurse in the app). The app retrieved each patient's
input data and BP measurements from a home BP monitoring device, securely transferred the data to the cloud server, and analysed these data
based on an algorithm developed with the assistance of health professionals to generate a personalized programme of lifestyle modifications
designed to reduce BP. Patient data, including BP measurements, daily
activities, and progress on the proposed programme, were simultaneously transferred and shown to healthcare providers using web-based software (HERB Console).
Based on their personal data, physicians can support patients, promote
daily app usage (e.g. watching educational lectures in the app), and provide education related to BP management. The HERB Mobile has the following three 'Steps' to foster implementation and adherence to
individualized lifestyle modification to bridge the gap between current
lifestyle and their ideal goals: Step 1, input and education-a personalized
interactive education programme including lectures and advice via a 'virtual nurse' based on biological, psychological and social data; Step 2, appsupported interventions-specific instruction to implement lifestyle
modifications based on the knowledge and techniques provided in Step 1
(decrease salt intake, body weight control, exercise, improving sleep condition, stress coping, and reducing alcohol intake); and Step 3, self-planning and evaluation-encouragement to combine non-pharmacological
lifestyle modifications from Step 2 to maximize reductions in BP.
Completion of Step 1 was defined as receiving all 14 interactive education
chapters, and completion of Step 2 was defined as the app user having
successfully experienced and achieved three consecutive recommended
goals in each category.
For the first 12 weeks of the study, use of antihypertensive medication,
sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, Chinese herbal medicines
known to cause hypertension, and intake of foods approved by the
Japan's Consumer Affairs Agency as 'food for specified health uses' was
prohibited, and other interventions that could lower BP were discouraged (e.g. use of other smartphone apps that measure or store BP data or
are designed to help lower BP). Addition of antihypertensive therapy
according to current guidelines14 was permitted from Week 12 onwards
at the discretion of physicians.

Endpoints
The primary endpoint was the mean change in 24-h ambulatory SBP from
baseline to 12 weeks. Key secondary endpoints (evaluated at 12 and

.. 24 weeks) include the following: proportion of patients with a >_5-mmHg
..
.. change from baseline in mean 24-h SBP (efficacy rate); mean changes in
.. ambulatory 24-h diastolic blood pressure (DBP); mean changes in home
..
.. daytime and nighttime SBP, DBP, and heart rate; mean changes in office
.. SBP, DBP, and heart rate; mean change in salt intake measured by a salt
.. check sheet;16 app usage and progress through app educational pro..
.. grammes; and adverse events. Please see the study design paper for full
.. details.15 An adverse event was defined as any unfavourable medical
..
.. event occurring during the trial.
..
..
..
.. Assessments
..
.. Full methodological details have been published previously.15 Study visits
.. took place at Weeks 4, 8, and 12 after randomization. In addition, patients
..
.. were further evaluated after the end of study intervention (at Weeks 16,
.. 20, and 24) and were divided into subgroups based on the antihyperten.. sive medication usage within each randomized group.
..
..
Ambulatory BP was measured at screening, and Weeks 12 and 24,
.. using a validated device (TM-2241; A&D Co.) in accordance with proce..
.. dures recommended by the JSH guidelines14 and the Hypertension, brain,
.. cardiovascular and renal Outcome Prevention and Evidence in Asia
..
.. (HOPE Asia) Network.17 Mean 24-h BP was calculated as the average of
.. all successful readings. Participants recorded the times that they fell
.. asleep and woke up in a diary. They were instructed to rest or sleep dur..
.. ing nighttime and to maintain their usual daytime activities. Nighttime BP
.. readings were those recorded from the time of falling asleep to the time
..
.. of waking up; all other values were defined as daytime readings. Patients
.. were classified into the following groups based on the fall in nighttime BP:
.. extreme dipper (>_20% fall); dipper (10-20% fall); non-dipper (0 to <10%
..
.. fall); and riser (increase in BP at night).
..
Home BP was measured for 5-7 days before study visits at Weeks 4, 8,
..
.. 12, and 24. Home BP measurements were performed with a validated de.. vice (UA-651BLE; A&D Co.) in accordance with the JSH and HOPE Asia
.. Network recommendations.14,18,19 Patients in the digital therapeutics
..
.. group were instructed to connect their home BP monitoring device to
.. the HERB Mobile app via Bluetooth and enable forwarding of BP values
..
.. from the device to the app, and patients in the control group were
.. instructed to store BP values in the home BP monitoring device for
.. download at their next visit. In cases of temporary app malfunction during
..
.. the study, patients were asked to record home BP values in a paper diary
.. and these values were included in the analysis.
..
Office BP was measured at each study visit (Weeks 4, 8, 12, and 24).
..
.. Two measurements were taken on each occasion based on instructions
.. in the 2019 JSH guidelines.14 The average of two stable values (difference
..
.. <5 mmHg) was recorded; if the two readings differed by >_5 mmHg, then
.. readings were repeated.
..
Blood test and urinalysis were performed at screening, and at Weeks
..
.. 12 and 24. Body weight and body mass index (BMI) were also assessed at
.. screening, and at Weeks 12 and 24.
..
..
..
..
.. Adherence monitoring
..
.. The following measures were used to evaluate app usage and adherence
.. to recommendations: (i) mobile app engagement rate and (ii) self..
.. reported executive scores for app-guided behaviours. The mobile app
.. engagement rate was calculated as the number of days that the app was
.. spontaneously opened and used in the 7 days before each scheduled visit
..
.. divided by seven. Self-reported executive scores for app-guided behav.. iours were defined as the progress with proportions of each app-guided
.. behaviour component, including knowledge acquisition (50%) and app..
. guided behaviour execution (50%).

Sample size
Full details of the sample size calculation have been detailed elsewhere.15 In brief, based on the findings of a pilot study,13 the difference between the digital therapeutic and control group for the
primary endpoint (change from baseline in mean 24-h SBP) was estimated to be 5 mmHg with a standard deviation of 14 mmHg. Based
on a two-tailed alpha level of 5% and 90% power, the required sample
size was calculated to be 165 patients per group. The recruitment target was set at 180 patients per group based on an assumed drop-out
rate of 10%.

Between-group comparisons in secondary endpoints were performed
using ANCOVA or logistic regression adjusted for the appropriate
covariates.
Sensitivity analysis for the primary endpoint was performed in the perprotocol population (defined as the subset of participants who complied
with the study protocol). In addition, subgroup analyses were performed
to assess the interactions between the digital therapeutics intervention
and each subgroup using a regression model adjusting for centre and history of antihypertensive medication usage. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS statistical software version 9.4 or higher (SAS Institute
Inc., Cary, NC, USA), R version 3.6.1 (The R Foundation, Vienna, Austria)
with ggplot2 package for creating figures, and P-values <0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.

Results
Patients
Of 946 patients assessed for eligibility between December 2019 and
June 2020, 390 patients with essential hypertension were randomly
allocated to the digital therapeutics group (n = 199) or the control
group (n = 191) (Figure 2). Baseline characteristics were well balanced
between the two groups (Table 1).
Twelve-week follow-up was complete for 192 patients (96.5%) in
the digital therapeutics group and 180 patients (94.2%) in the control

..
.. group (Figure 2). From 12 to 24 weeks, antihypertensive drugs were
.. prescribed for 78 patients (40.6%) in the digital therapeutics group
..
.. and 87 patients (48.3%) in the control group (Supplementary material
.. online, Table S2). Final follow-up at 24 weeks was complete for 191

Reductions from baseline in ambulatory, home and office DBP and
heart rate were also significantly greater in the digital therapeutics
group vs. control (Supplementary material online, Figures S2 and S3).
The proportion of patients achieving morning home BP <135/
85 mmHg at 12-week follow-up was 22.2% in the digital therapeutics
group and 10.4% in the control group (Supplementary material online, Table S6).
Between-group differences in home and office BP at 24 weeks
were slightly smaller than those at 12 weeks, but most betweengroup differences remained statistically significant. The additional
BP-lowering effects seen in the digital therapeutics group were maintained at the 24-week follow-up in the subgroup of patients who
were prescribed antihypertensive drugs after 12 weeks (Figure 4 and
Supplementary material online, Figures S4-S8).
Body weight (Supplementary material online, Figure S9) and BMI
(Supplementary material online, Figure S10) decreased to a significantly greater extent in the digital therapeutics vs. control group [between-group differences (95% CI) in BMI at 12 and 24 weeks of
-0.2 kg/m2 (-0.4 to -0.1), P = 0.005 and -0.3 kg/m2 (-0.5 to -0.1),
P = 0.005, respectively]. There was a significant correlation between
baseline BMI and the reduction in 24-h ambulatory SBP in the digital
therapeutics group (r = 0.21, P = 0.004) but not in the control group
(r = 0.14, P = 0.063). Other obesity-related metabolic risk factors and
measures of fatty liver were improved in the digital therapeutics
group at both 12- and 24-week follow-up (Supplementary material
online, Table S7).
Salt intake (based on salt check sheet points) (Supplementary material online, Figure S11) showed a significantly greater decrease from

..
.. baseline in the digital therapeutics group than in the control group
.. [between-group differences (95% CI) at 12 and 24 weeks of -2.9
..
.. points (-3.7 to -2.2), P < 0.001 and -2.7 points (95% CI -3.6 to -1.9),
.. P < 0.001, respectively]. Between-group differences in urinary sodium
..
.. corrected for urinary creatinine did not differ significantly between
.. treatment groups throughout the study (Supplementary material on..

..
..
.. Subgroup analysis
..
.. The only significant quantitative interaction between subgroups for
..
.. treatment differences in 24-h ambulatory SBP at 12 weeks between
.. the digital therapeutics and control groups was seen for baseline 24-h

.. ambulatory SBP (Figure 5). The between-group difference was signifi.. cantly greater in patients with baseline 24-h ambulatory SBP >_145 vs.
..
.. <145 mmHg (between-group differences of -3.9 and -1.3 mmHg, re.. spectively, P interaction <0.001). Patients with baseline 24-h ambula..
.. tory SBP >_145 mmHg had a significantly higher BMI and waist
.. circumference and were more likely to have a history of antihyper..
.. tensive drug use than those with a baseline 24-h ambulatory SBP

(Supplementary material online, Figure S13). At 24 weeks, >90% of
patients had completed all Step 1 and Step 2 recommendations
(Supplementary material online, Table S9). There was a significant
correlation between self-reported executive score for app-guided
behaviours and the reduction in 24-h ambulatory SBP (r = -0.23,
P = 0.002).
The proportion of patients who measured morning and evening
home BP values at the 12-week follow-up was 97.4% and 93.8%, respectively, in the digital therapeutics group and 98.9% and 96.7%, respectively, in the control group.

Adverse events
A total of 91 patients (45.5%) in the digital therapeutics group and 54
(27.8%) in the control group reported any adverse event during the
study (Supplementary material online, Table S10); none of these
were considered to be related to the digital therapeutics system.
There were two serious adverse events in each group: one admitted
to hospital for pulmonary embolism in the digital therapeutics group
and one lymphoma in the control group. No psychological adverse
events were reported in either group.
Forty-eight patients (24.0%) in the digital therapeutics group experienced temporary system malfunctions during the trial (35 were unable to connect the app to a home BP monitor via Bluetooth, 7 had

Discussion
Although there is some older literature investigating the use of digital
interventions in patients with hypertension,11 the novelty of this
HERB-DH1 pivotal trial is the randomized, controlled evaluation of
the office, home, and ambulatory BP-lowering effects of adding a
comprehensive digital therapeutic intervention to standard lifestyle
modification alone in patients with hypertension not currently receiving antihypertensive medication. The study met its primary and secondary efficacy endpoints, with significant reductions in 24-h
ambulatory, home, and office SBP values in patients managed with
digital therapeutics plus lifestyle modification compared with standard lifestyle modification alone (Graphical abstract). Some of these
benefits persisted over time, even when antihypertensive agents
were permitted (from Week 12 onwards). However, home SBP
reductions were not maintained to 24 weeks in the subgroup who
did not have addition of antihypertensive medication at Week 12.
The digital therapeutic programme was well accepted by study participants, who showed good app usage and adherence to recommendations, as shown by a >95% engagement rate with the mobile app
and the fact that 90% of the participants completed all Step 1 and
Step 2 recommendations. There was a significant correlation

between executive score for app-guided behaviours and the reduction in 24-h ambulatory SBP.
The finding of consistent BP reductions throughout the 24-h
period in the digital therapeutics group of the current study was consistent in the full analysis set and per-protocol analyses and across a
variety of patient subgroups. In addition, this is similar to the results
of our previous study investigating the BP-lowering effect of salt restriction by expert nutritionists.20 These observations might have
particular clinical relevance to patients whose 24-h BP phenotype is
associated with a high cardiovascular risk, especially those with nocturnal or early morning hypertension.21,22 The findings of our subgroup analysis showed that the digital therapeutic intervention could
reduce SBP in patients with hypertension irrespective of 24-h BP pattern. Furthermore, the ability of digital therapeutic interventions to
lower BP throughout the 24-h period is not limited by reductions in
therapeutic effect at the end of the dosing window, as might occur
with shorter-acting pharmacological antihypertensive agents. In particular, one important limitation of oral antihypertensive therapy is
that drug concentrations might reach a relative trough during the
night and early morning periods because of once daily (typically
morning) dosing schedules and the pharmacokinetics of drug clearance. The potential for more continuous effects on BP during use of
digital therapeutic interventions might be relevant in mitigating the
loss of BP control associated with non-adherence to drug therapy,
which is an important issue in hypertension management.23

The findings of our study in untreated patients with hypertension are consistent with those from a retrospective study investigating a digitally delivered intervention including goal setting, skill
building, and self-monitoring.24 The change from baseline in morning home SBP in the intervention group from our study was
10.6 mmHg, compared with an 11.5 mmHg reduction from in SBP
from baseline (P < 0.001) over a mean follow-up of 62.6 days in
the retrospective study of patients with BP >_130/80 mmHg, with
or without antihypertensive therapy.24 Also, consistent between
the two studies was the fact that reductions in BP occurred within the first few weeks after starting the digital therapeutic
intervention.
In the current study, a significant reduction from baseline in home
SBP was seen in both the digital therapeutics and control groups,
both of which performed self-monitoring of home BP and received
standard lifestyle modification education. As demonstrated in a metaanalysis, self-monitoring of BP per se appeared to reduce BP in
patients with hypertension25 and this likely contributed to the reduction in home BP during our study. However, the meta-analysis data
suggested that the combination of self-monitoring of BP with other
interventions including lifestyle counselling and self-management
might be the most effective approach,25 which is consistent with our
findings.

.. of the intervention to those most likely to benefit. Our results
.. showed a significant interaction between baseline BP level and the ef..
.. ficacy of the digital therapeutic approach, with reductions in BP being
.. smaller in those with baseline 24-h ambulatory SBP >_145 vs.
..
.. <145 mmHg. Patients with higher vs. lower 24-h ambulatory SBP at
.. baseline had significantly higher BMI, waist circumference, and history
..
.. of antihypertensive use. Thus, it is possible that patients with a higher
.. baseline BP might not implement non-pharmacological lifestyle modi..
.. fications very well, even though they theoretically should have more
.. motivation to lower their BP. Another factor that could be used as
..
.. part of patient selection for digital therapeutics is how well patients
.. are adhering to standard lifestyle modification recommendations at
..
.. baseline. However, additional real-world data and research are
.. needed to better define patients who would be good candidates for a
..
.. digital therapeutic approach to initial hypertension management.
..
..
.. Limitations
..
.. Although a key strength of this trial is the evaluation of the ambula.. tory and home BP-lowering effects of digital therapeutics compared
..
.. with standard lifestyle modifications in untreated patients with hyper.. tension, several limitations need to be considered when interpreting
..
.. our findings. The trial enrolled a selected group of patients with
.. hypertension (i.e. those not currently receiving pharmacological ther..
.. apy who agreed to non-drug management for at least 12 weeks, and
.. without an indication for immediate drug treatment). For example,
..
.. patients with a history of heart failure or atherosclerotic cardiovascu.. lar disease were not eligible for this study due to the need for therapy
..
.. with agents such as renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors.
.. Therefore, the findings cannot be generalized to patient groups other
..
.. than those enrolled in the study, including higher-risk groups for
.. whom at least 12 weeks without pharmacological antihypertensive
..
.. therapy would be inappropriate. Adherence in the current study, as
.. determined based on app engagement and implementation of app..
.. suggested lifestyle modifications, was very high and may reflect the
.. characteristics of the population studied. Therefore, caution should
..
.. be exercised in generalizing the findings to other groups (e.g. based
.. on ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and level of education).
..
..
Although our study included some evaluation of the effect of the
.. intervention in the presence of antihypertensive drug therapy, the
..
.. data are limited and more detailed investigations are required, includ..
.. ing differentiation between mono- and combination therapy recipi.. ents. Based on the Japanese guideline recommendation for 12 weeks
..
.. of non-pharmacological management in treatment-naive patients
.. with hypertension,14 we limited the off-medication period to
..
.. 12 weeks in the current study to limit the duration of time patients
.. were not receiving drug therapy. However, this time period may not
..
.. have been sufficient to fully evaluate the BP-lowering effects of the
.. digital therapeutic intervention. After 12 weeks, doctors were per..
.. mitted to prescribe antihypertensive medication to achieve BP con.. trol. This occurred in 78/199 (39%) and 87/191 (46%) of patients in
..
.. the digital therapeutics and control groups, respectively. At the 24.. week follow-up, only between-group differences in morning and
..
.. evening home SBP remained statistically significant. This suggests that
.. there might be an attenuation of the positive effect of the digital inter..
.. vention over time, as partially confirmed by the lack of differences in
.. BP values between the digital therapeutics and control groups in
..
. study participants who did not start antihypertensive medication.

medication showed that this was associated with better control of
SBP than usual care.26 In addition, the incremental costs of the digital
intervention were low.26 Although BP reductions in that study could
also be attributed to titration of antihypertensive medication, followup between 12 and 24 weeks in our trial showed that reductions in
BP associated with use of the digital therapeutics system were maintained even with the addition of antihypertensive drug therapy. The
findings of another recent randomized, open-label trial of patients
with uncontrolled hypertension were less positive, showing that
those managed using a smartphone coaching app did not have lower
BP at 6 months compared with those managed using a BP tracking
app.27 That study was limited by a sample size that was not large
enough to detect small, but potentially relevant, differences between
treatment groups. Furthermore, the majority had uncontrolled BP
despite treatment with >_1 antihypertensive agent, making direct
comparison with our results difficult.
With respect to morning home SBP, the difference in change from
baseline between the digital therapeutics and control group at Week
12 was -4.3 mmHg (P < 0.001). This difference was evident from
Week 4 onwards and persisted until Week 24, even after antihypertensive medication was initiated in some patients. However, reductions in home SBP at Week 24 were only seen in patients who
started using antihypertensive therapy at Week 12, whereas SBP
returned towards baseline levels in those without medication. This
suggests a role for a combination strategy to maximize morning
home BP reductions. Given that morning home SBP is an independent risk factor for clinical stroke events,28 the additional BP-lowering
effects of digital therapeutics over conventional lifestyle modification
might be clinically relevant in terms of reducing cardiovascular risk.
Furthermore, the absolute reduction from baseline in morning home
SBP at Week 12 was 10.6 mmHg in the digital therapeutics group (vs.
6.2 mmHg in the control group; both P < 0.001 vs. baseline). In a
meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of antihypertensive
treatment, a 10 mmHg reduction in office SBP was associated with a
20% reduction in the risk of major cardiovascular events, a 17% reduction in the risk of coronary heart disease, a 27% reduction in the
risk of stroke, a 28% reduction in the risk of heart failure, and a 13%
reduction in all-cause mortality.4 Given that morning home SBP is
more closely associated with cardiovascular events than office SBP,
the magnitude of reduction in morning SBP seen in the digital therapeutics group of our study (10.6 mmHg) should be clinically relevant.
Reductions in home BP were evident by Week 4 after randomization and continued until Week 12, reflecting the different 'Steps' of
the digital therapeutics programme. Self-reported salt intake score
and body weight also decreased significantly during the intervention.
In addition, the degree of reduction in BMI was weakly but significantly correlated with decreases in BP in the digital therapeutics group.
Thus, the mechanism of significant BP reduction in the digital therapeutics group is likely to be due, at least in part, to the successful and
persistent execution of non-pharmacological behaviours guided by
the HERB system. Obesity-related metabolic risk factors and measures of fatty liver improved in the digital therapeutics group during
the study, and this is another mechanism by which this nonpharmacological digital therapeutic approach could reduce overall
cardiovascular risk.
Information on which patients might obtain the greatest benefit
from a digital therapeutic intervention would be helpful to target use

Efficacy of a digital therapeutics system

Conclusions
The results of this study highlight the potential effects of digital therapeutics for non-pharmacological lifestyle modification to reduce BP
in untreated patients with essential hypertension. The International
Society of Hypertension has highlighted the need for population-level
initiatives to reduce the global burden of elevated BP, including diet
and exercise recommendations and reducing salt intake.29 Digital
tools, such as the HERB system evaluated in this study, have the potential to contribute to these initiatives for patients with early-stage
hypertension by facilitating the implementation and effectiveness of
lifestyle modification messages and behaviours.

Given that BP data obtained after Week 12 in the current study were
obtained in a non-randomized setting, longer follow-up of untreated
patients is needed to provide additional data on the persistence of
effects of the digital intervention. In addition, evaluation of this approach specifically in treated patients with hypertension is required.
Another point to note is the fact that withdrawal rates were higher
in the control group than in the intervention group, although the perprotocol results were consistent with those in the full analysis set.
The planned recruitment period for this study was affected by the
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and enrolment
took 3 months longer than initially planned. In addition, some patients
were late for their scheduled visit due to the pandemic. Despite this,
we were able to complete the study as planned with a very low number of dropouts and missing values. In fact, the pandemic highlights
the value of being able to monitor patients and provide input on disease management remotely.
