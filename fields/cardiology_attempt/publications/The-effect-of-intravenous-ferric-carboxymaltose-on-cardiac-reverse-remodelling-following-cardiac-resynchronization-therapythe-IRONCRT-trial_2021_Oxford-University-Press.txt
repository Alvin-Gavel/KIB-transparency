Aims

Iron deficiency is common in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and negatively affects cardiac
function and structure. The study the effect of ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) on cardiac reverse remodelling and
contractile status in HFrEF.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
Symptomatic HFrEF patients with iron deficiency and a persistently reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF
and results
<45%) at least 6 months after cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) implant were prospectively randomized to

FCM or standard of care (SOC) in a double-blind manner. The primary endpoint was the change in LVEF from baseline to 3-month follow-up assessed by three-dimensional echocardiography. Secondary endpoints included the change
in left ventricular end-systolic (LVESV) and end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) from baseline to 3-month follow-up.
Cardiac performance was evaluated by the force-frequency relationship as assessed by the slope change of the cardiac contractility index (CCI = systolic blood pressure/LVESV index) at 70, 90, and 110 beats of biventricular pacing.
A total of 75 patients were randomized to FCM (n = 37) or SOC (n = 38). At baseline, both treatment groups were
well matched including baseline LVEF (34 +/- 7 vs. 33 +/- 8, P = 0.411). After 3 months, the change in LVEF was significantly higher in the FMC group [th4.22%, 95% confidence interval (CI) th3.05%; th5.38%] than in the SOC group (-0.23%,
95% CI -1.44%; th0.97%; P < 0.001). Similarly, LVESV (-9.72 mL, 95% CI -13.5 mL; -5.93 mL vs. -1.83 mL, 95% CI
-5.7 mL; 2.1 mL; P = 0.001), but not LVEDV (P = 0.748), improved in the FCM vs. the SOC group. At baseline, both
treatment groups demonstrated a negative force-frequency relationship, as defined by a decrease in CCI at higher
heart rates (negative slope). FCM resulted in an improvement in the CCI slope during incremental biventricular pacing, with a positive force-frequency relationship at 3 months. Functional status and exercise capacity, as measured by
the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire and peak oxygen consumption, were improved by FCM.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusions
Treatment with FCM in HFrEF patients with iron deficiency and persistently reduced LVEF after CRT results in an
improvement of cardiac function measured by LVEF, LVESV, and cardiac force-frequency relationship.

Introduction
Iron deficiency is common in heart failure with a reduced ejection
fraction (HFrEF) and associated with a reduced functional status,
poor exercise performance, and increased risk for heart failure hospitalization and cardiovascular mortality.1-3 Iron is an essential cofactor in proteins of oxidative phosphorylation and anti-oxidative
enzymes and as a result involved in the pathophysiology of progressive cardiac remodelling and failing cardiac and peripheral muscle energetics in heart failure.4,5 The negative impact of iron deficiency on

cardiac contractility is more pronounced during exercise.6,7 In normal
physiological conditions, contractility increases disproportionally to
heart rate, a phenomenon called a positive force-frequency relationship.8 In HFrEF patients with iron deficiency, cardiac output increases
less in comparison to non-iron-deficient counterparts during exercise.7 Animal models of iron deficiency indicate that during higher
heart rates, the compensatory increase in ATP and phosphocreatine
is blunted, resulting in a decrease in contractility at higher heart rates
(negative force-frequency relationship).6 This feature is also found in
HFrEF patients, when evaluating contractile status using an

The IRON-CRT trial

Methods
Study population
Patients were eligible for the IRON-CRT trial if (i) aged >_18 years, (ii) had
stable heart failure (on maximal tolerated doses of all guidelinerecommended medical heart failure therapies for at least 4 weeks, with
the exception of loop diuretics), (iii) received CRT as part of their treatment plan for HFrEF (according to a guideline class IA, IB, IIa, or IIb indication) >6 months previously, (iv) had persistently reduced LVEF <45% at
screening, (v) had >_98% biventricular pacing the last 6 months before inclusion, (vi) had symptomatic heart failure defined as a New York Heart
Association (NYHA) class >_II, and (vii) had iron deficiency defined as a
serum ferritin <100 ng/mL or serum ferritin between 100 and 300 ng/mL
if transferrin saturation (TSAT) was <20%. A baseline LVEF up to 45%
was allowed in this trial based on the data of previous trials with FCM in
heart failure, which used this as LVEF entry criteria.14-16 Exclusion criteria
are reported in Supplementary material online, Table S1. Ethical approval
was obtained from each participating centre and all patients provided
written informed consent before enrolment. The study followed the
principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki and is in compliance
with the standards of Good Clinical Practice. The manuscript was drafted
according to the CONSORT guidelines for randomized controlled
trials.17

Study design
The methods and design of IRON-CRT have been published previously.9 Briefly, the IRON-CRT trial was an investigator-initiated,
double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted in
two sites in Belgium (Ziekenhuis Oost-Limburg, Genk and Jessa
Hospital, Hasselt). The aim of the IRON-CRT trial was to assess the
impact of intravenous FCM compared to placebo on cardiac reverse
remodelling and cardiac contractile status in HFrEF patients with
iron deficiency who experienced incomplete reverse remodelling at
least 6 months after CRT. If patients sufficed all inclusion and exclusion criteria and provided written informed consent, patients were
randomized using a web-based randomization system (Castor EDC).

Figure 1 CONSORT flow chart of patients screened, randomized and followed up. A total of 221 met the inclusion criteria (numbers 1-6) mentioned in the Methods section and were screened for
the presence of iron deficiency, which was present in 48%.
Exclusion criteria included haemoglobin >15 g/dL, C-reactive protein >20 mg/L, insufficient image quality to assure three-dimensional
echocardiography, and active inclusion in another randomized controlled trial or recent (<30 days) completion of another randomized controlled trial.

.. Patients were assigned in balanced blocks assuring 1:1 randomization
..
.. to either intravenous placebo [standard of care (SOC) group, with
.. continuation of optimal medical therapy] or intravenous FCM. A
..
.. block-randomization strategy without capping was used assuring an
.. equal number of patients with a baseline LVEF <35% and LVEF >_35%
..
.. in both treatment arms. An LVEF of 35% was chosen to stratify into
.. blocks of lower and higher baseline LVEF, based on the observation
.. from previous trials illustrating a mean LVEF of on average 35% if an
..
.. LVEF entry criteria of 45% was used.14,16,18 The study was designed
.. and conducted by the first and last author of the manuscript. The
..
.. study received an unrestricted research grant from Vifor Pharma.
.. Vifor Pharma had no input in the design, collection, analysis or inter..
.. pretation of the study. All analyses were performed according to a
.. predefined statistical analysis plan, by an independent academic stat.. istician (CenStat, University Hasselt). The IRON-CRT trial was regis..
.. tered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03380520). Anonymized data will
.. be made available upon reasonable request to the corresponding
..
.. author.
..
..
.. Study drug administration and blinding
.. The active treatment intervention consisted of intravenous iron in the
..
.. form of intravenous FCM (InjectaferV/Ferinject V-Glattbrugg,
.. Switzerland) diluted into 250 mL NaCl 0.9%. The placebo intervention
..
.. consisted of the same 250 mL NaCl 0.9% without FCM. The required
.. dose of FCM was calculated according to the regulatory-approved dosing

incremental biventricular pacing protocol.9 In addition, HFrEF
patients with iron deficiency receiving cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) exhibit diminished cardiac reverse remodelling following
CRT implant, documented by less improvement in left ventricular
ejection fraction (LVEF).10,11
Ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) is recommended by heart failure
guidelines to alleviate heart failure symptoms, to improve exercise
capacity and quality of life.12 Recently, the AFFIRM-AHF (Study to
Compare Ferric Carboxymaltose With Placebo in Patients with
Acute Heart Failure and Iron Deficiency) has also demonstrated the
beneficial impact of FCM on the recurrence of heart failure admissions in patients with recent acute heart failure.13 Nevertheless, little
information is available about the effect of FCM on cardiac function
and structure. The IRON-CRT trial (Effect of Intravenous Ferric
Carboxymaltose on Reverse Remodelling Following Cardiac
Resynchronization Therapy) was a prospective, double-blind
randomized multi-centre trial specifically designed to determine if
treatment with FCM (i) induces incremental reverse remodelling in
CRT patients with iron deficiency and a persistently reduced LVEF
and (ii) is capable of improving the force-frequency relationship in
HFrEF.

dose needed was calculated based on screening weight and screening
haemoglobin. Based on this dosing scheme, patients would require a dose
of FCM ranging between 500 and 2000 mg. Because the maximal allowed
dose of FCM during one intravenous administration is 1000 mg per week,
patients who required a dose of either 1500 or 2000 mg received a
follow-up appointment after 1-2 weeks to receive the remaining dose.
To assure maximal blinding, patients assigned to the placebo group who
would also require an additional dose based on their body weight and
haemoglobin levels also received a second dosing appointment with the
infusion of placebo at that time. As the collection of the endpoints in this
study occur on a relative short basis (3 months), no additional

maintenance doses of FCM were administered. Because FCM is a darkbrown solution, additional measures were undertaken to assure patient
and investigator blinding.14,16,18 Both the placebo and FCM solutions
were covered in non-see-through white bags. In addition, all infusion lines
were made of non-see-through white plastic, avoiding the detection of
the colour of the infusate (Supplementary material online, Figure S1). A
study member from the Clinical Trial Unit (CTU) of the Ziekenhuis
Oost-Limburg (Genk, Belgium), not involved in endpoint assessment, was
unblinded and responsible for randomization, preparation, and administration of the blinded study infusate (FCM of placebo). In addition, all

Echocardiographic endpoints
The objective of this study was to determine if treatment with FCM (i)
induces incremental reverse remodelling and (ii) is capable of improving
cardiac contractile function. The primary endpoint was the change in

.. LVEF from baseline to 3-month follow-up. Secondary endpoints of re..
.. verse remodelling were the change from baseline in left ventricular end.. systolic (LVESV) and end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) to 3 months. LVEF,
..
.. LVEDV, and LVESV were measured using three-dimensional (3D) trans.. thoracic echocardiography by an experienced blinded sonographer to
..
and minimize intra.. alleviate inter-observer variability (one observer)
.. observer variability (3D echocardiography).19 The second objective of
.. this study was to determine if FCM treatment is capable of improving car..
.. diac contractility by assessing the force-frequency relationship. The gold
.. standard for measuring the force-frequency relationship is by plotting in..
.. vasively measured contractility against heart rate. Previous studies how.. ever have used a non-invasive surrogate (cardiac contractility index,
.. CCI).8,20 This CCI is the ratio between systolic blood pressure divided by
..
.. LVESV index (LVESV/body surface area). To determine the force-fre.. quency relationship, all patients underwent a previously validated pacing
..
.. protocol.8,9 A detailed description of all echocardiographic measure.. ments and this pacing protocol can be found in the Supplementary mater..
.. ial online, methods. Briefly, patients underwent biventricular pacing in
.. DDD mode (or VVI in case of atrial fibrillation) at different lower rates of
.. pacing (70, 90, and 110 b.p.m.). The lower rate was first programmed to
..
.. 70 b.p.m. After a 5-min adaptation period in decubitus, blood pressure
.. measurements (the arm with the highest pressure) were repeated three
..
.. times and averaged. Patients were then positioned in left lateral decubi.. tus, and after a 5-min adaptation period, echocardiographic measure.. ments were taken to calculate the CCI. The R-mode of the CRT device
..
.. was programmed off during this image protocol to avoid movement
.. inducing surges in heart rate above the programmed lower rate. This
..
.. protocol was afterward repeated for a pacing rate of 90 and 110 b.p.m.
.. The impact of FCM on cardiac performance was assessed as the change
..
.. in the slope of CCI at different heart rates (force-frequency relationship),
.. with a negative slope indicating a negative force-frequency relationship
.. and a positive slope a positive relationship.
..
..
.. Other endpoints
..
.. Other supporting endpoints included the change from baseline to 3.. month follow-up in: (i) cardiopulmonary exercise test variables of peak
..
.. oxygen consumption (VO2) and the slope of minute ventilation/carbon
.. dioxide production (VE/VCO2) ratio, (ii) Kansas City Cardiomyopathy
..
.. Questionnaire (KCCQ) score, and (iii) N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic
.. peptide (NT-proBNP) level. In addition, safety and tolerability of the
.. study drug was assessed by collecting adverse events. A detailed descrip..
.. tion of the methods on these supporting endpoints can be found in the
.. Supplementary material online, methods.
..
..
.. Statistics
..
.. The IRON-CRT trial was powered for the primary endpoint, change in
.. LVEF from baseline to 3-month follow-up. The sample size calculation
.. was based on a previous study illustrating in 40 patients (n = 20 iron su..
.. crose) a mean improvement in LVEF of 4.4% in favour of iron sucrose.21
.. Considering a type I error rate a = 0.05 and a type II error rate b = 0.10
..
.. (statistical power of 90%), we calculated a total sample size of 66 patients
.. to detect a mean 2.4% difference in LVEF, using a 3% absolute difference
..
.. in LVEF standard deviation. In addition, to account for potential drop-out
.. and to allow for more power for the secondary endpoint of force.. frequency relationship, the sample size was rounded to 100 patients. Due
..
.. to poor enrolment in one of the centres (no patients were enrolled at
.. Jessa Hospital as this site was activated just before the COVID-19 pan..
.. demic), it was decided to close the study prematurely at 75 patients in
.. December 2020. Because only three patients were lost to follow-up, this
.. was well above the calculated sample size of 66 patients. Data analysis for
..
. the efficacy endpoints were assessed for a full analysis set (FAS). The FAS

consists of patients randomly assigned to treatment that received trial
medication and had at least one post-baseline assessment. Because three
patients died (all in the SOC group) before the post-baseline assessment,
these patients were excluded from this analysis. As predefined in the analysis plan, the effect of missing data on the primary endpoint was assessed
in a sensitivity analysis. Missing not at random imputation was done by
creating control-based pattern imputation (regression model created
using baseline age, gender and baseline LVEF, LVESV, and LVEDV).9 The
change in primary (LVEF), secondary (LVESV and LVEDV) and tertiary
endpoints (peakVO2, VE/VCO2, KCCQ, and NT-proBNP) from baseline
to 3-month follow-up were assessed using analysis of covariance adjusted
for the baseline value. Squared transformation was performed in case of
none normal distributions. The force-frequency relationship was
assessed using linear mixed models including a fixed effect of randomization group, heart rate (linear assumption), time (baseline or follow-up),
and an interaction term of the aforementioned fixed effects. Categorical
safety endpoints and investigator reported adverse events were assessed
at 3 months using Fisher's exact test. Risk differences were calculated and

.. presented with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), using the Clopper-
..
.. Pearson method. Predefined subgroup analyses for the primary endpoint

case treatment, allocation was unblinded before dataset lock.
Baseline characteristics of the patients included are shown in

medical heart failure therapies. Supplementary material online,
Table S3 describes patient characteristics historically before CRT
implant and potential confounders of reverse remodelling,
illustrating two well-balanced treatment groups. Based on their
weight and haemoglobin levels, patients in the FCM group
received a mean dose of 959 +/- 380 mg FCM (median 1000 mg).
All patients received their first dose on the day of randomization.
Patients requiring an additional dose >1000 mg received their
second dose on average 9 days later (range 8-14 days).

Subgroup analysis

Discussion
This prospective, randomized double-blind trial offers novel important information regarding the effect of FCM on cardiac function and
structure in HFrEF patients with persistently reduced LVEF despite
optimal medical and device management. The main findings are that
intravenous iron repletion (i) results in an improvement of LVEF and
LVESV, (ii) results in force-frequency amplification and therefore at
least partially restores cardiac contractile performance, and (iii)
improves functional status (KCCQ) and maximal exercise capacity
measured by peak VO2 (Graphical abstract).
Iron is an essential co-factor for anti-oxidative enzymes and is part
of the iron-sulfur clusters of the first three elements of the electron
transport chain in mitochondria.4,22 As such, iron deficiency is implicated as an important comorbidity in the pathophysiology of heart
failure.4,22-27 Several trials have shown the beneficial effect of FCM
on functional status, maximal exercise capacity, and risk for heart failure readmissions.13,14,16,18 However, little data are available about
the effect on cardiac reverse remodelling of the guidelinerecommended intravenous iron formulation, being FCM.12 Animal
models indicate that iron deficiency is associated with progressive
cardiac remodelling.6,22 In addition, previous studies have suggested
that treatment of iron deficiency with iron sucrose is associated with
an improvement in LVEF, but these studies predate the use of contemporary heart failure therapies and used a different iron formulation (iron sucrose), currently not endorsed by the European Society
of Cardiology heart failure guidelines.28,29 More recently, an elegant
magnetic resonance imaging study illustrated that in HFrEF patients
with iron deficiency, treatment with FCM is capable of replenishing
intra-myocardial iron content as measured by T2* mapping cardiac
magnetic resonance sequences.30 Interestingly, changes in myocardial
iron content (T2*) were correlated with changes in LVEF, indicating
that myocardial iron repletion might improve left ventricular function.30,31 In HFrEF patients receiving CRT, several studies have illustrated that the presence of iron deficiency at the time of CRT implant

is associated with less left ventricular reverse remodelling in comparison to CRT recipients without iron deficiency.10,11 However, such
observational studies are not capable of answering the question of
causation beyond the observed correlations between reduced
remodelling and presence of iron deficiency. Persistent left ventricular dysfunction and symptomatic disease is present in up to 30% of
CRT recipients.32 We are the first to demonstrate in this doubleblind trial that treatment of iron deficiency with FCM results in an improvement of LVEF (LSM change th4.22%), reduces LVESV, and
improves functional status as measured by the KCCQ and exercise
capacity measured by peak VO2. By nature, randomized controlled
trials are capable of answering the question of causality, hereby showing that FCM offers incremental reverse remodelling. Importantly, although all patients were on guideline-recommended optimal medical
treatment consisting of neurohormonal blockers-including 50% on
angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor-and CRT, they remained
to have symptomatic severe heart failure with cardiac remodelling as
defined by their NYHA class, LVEF, left ventricular volumes, and NTproBNP. Because we selected heart failure patients with a persistently reduced LVEF after CRT implant, we are not able to answer the
question whether iron deficiency should be treated before CRT implant. Nevertheless, iron-deficient heart failure patients with a guideline indication for CRT (by nature of selection) also have a guideline
indication for treatment with FCM.12 Although we specifically targeted an HFrEF population demonstrating persistent heart failure
progression despite current guideline-recommended device and
medical therapy, there is no reason to believe that FCM would not
have similar effects in other iron-deficient HFrEF patients.
Careful elucidation of the beneficial effects of iron repletion in
improving myocardial contractile performance may hold an important key to understanding the role of iron deficiency in the failing heart.
By performing force-frequency relationship assessment, we illustrate
the impact of reversing iron deficiency in improvement of myocardial
performance.20 Pre-clinical studies have shown that incubation of
cardiomyocytes with an iron chelator results in a 74% reduction in
ATP content leading to diminished cardiomyocyte shortening.4
Haddad et al.6 demonstrated that this energetic crisis induced by iron
deficiency becomes more relevant at higher heart rates. We have

Figure 5 illustrates the results of the three predefined subgroup analyses. In all three subgroups, FCM resulted in a significantly higher (all
P < 0.05) improvement in LVEF in comparison to SOC. Testing for
interaction showed that the subgroup of patients with TSAT >_20%
had less improvement in LVEF than patients with a TSAT of <20%
(P-value for interaction = 0.0362); however, both subgroups still
demonstrated an improvement in LVEF in comparison to the SOC
subgroup (LSM difference FCM vs. SOC, TSAT >_20%: 2.15 [0.15-
4.14], P = 0.0363; TSAT <20%: 5.58 [3.60-7.56], P < 0.001). No heterogeneity in the treatment effect of FCM was found for patients
with vs. without a low haemoglobin (P-value for interaction = 0.279)
or low vs. higher baseline LVEF (P-value for interaction = 0.320).
Similarly, using LVEF 40% as cut-off to define high vs. low LVEF did
not indicate significant interaction in the treatment effect of FCM (Pvalue for interaction = 0.2996).

Limitations
Several limitations should be acknowledged. First, we used 3D echocardiography and not magnetic resonance imaging to determine
LVEF and left ventricular volumes because all patients had a CRT.
Nevertheless, 3D echocardiography has shown excellent correlation
with magnetic resonance measurements of LVEF and left ventricular
volumes. The semi-automated algorithms used offer high reproducibility and low test-retest variability. Studies have shown that the
source of the largest variability between 3D echocardiography and
magnetic resonance imaging stems from poor image quality.34
Therefore, to optimize the accuracy of our analysis, poor twodimensional image quality on screening evaluation was an exclusion
criteria. Second, we did not invasively measure cardiac contractility
during incremental pacing. Third, we studied CRT patients to determine changes in the force-frequency relationship; therefore, results
might not apply to all HFrEF patients. Fourth, the sample size is relatively small compared to other trials with FCM. Fifth, due to the
COVID-19 pandemic, no patients were included from the Jessa
Hospital. As such, the generated results might not be applicable to
broader range of practice settings.

previously shown that HFrEF patients with iron deficiency have a
diminished contractile reserve during exercise.9 We now demonstrate that FCM is capable of improving cardiac contractile performance. Indeed, treatment with FCM did reverse the negative downsloping relation between non-invasive CCI and heart rate towards a
positive upsloping relation.
In line with previous trials of HFrEF patients with iron deficiency,
FCM also improved functional status as measured by the KCCQ.14,18
Similarly, in line with the EFFECT-HF (Effect of Ferric Carboxymaltose on Exercise Capacity in Patients With Iron Deficiency and
Chronic Heart Failure) trial,16 we show that FCM improves maximal
exercise capacity as measured by peak VO2. While the EFFECT-HF
trial mainly demonstrated a prevention in further decline of peak
VO2 in comparison to the control group, we document a positive improvement in peak VO2 (th0.87 mL/kg/min, 95% CI 0.05; 1.68). A potential reason might be the fact that all our patients had a CRT device
and that rate adaptive pacing with a high upper rate was provided if
necessary, thereby overcoming chronotropic incompetence.
Finally, we did not find a statistical interaction between the treatment effect of FCM and the presence of anaemia or a lower or higher
baseline LVEF. Although guidelines position FCM for the treatment of
symptomatic iron-deficient HFrE, defined as LVEF <40%, our study is
consistent with the CONFIRM-HF and AFFIRM-AHF trials in showing
no significant interaction if LVEF was above 40%, suggesting that FCM
works equally well in patients with an LVEF 40-45%.13,18 Similarly to
the meta-analysis of Anker et al.,33 we did observe significant interaction between the treatment effect of FCM and the presence of a
high TSAT >_20% (also referred to as patients with isolated hypoferritinaemia). While these patients still had an improvement in LVEF, the effect was less pronounced than if TSAT was <20%. Nevertheless, the
recent AFFIRM-AHF trial (the largest published trial to date with FCM
in heart failure) did not observe a treatment interaction with low or
high TSAT, showing that the effect of FCM on endpoints such as heart
failure hospitalization is perhaps more than just an improvement in
LVEF or cardiac contractility but also relates to the effects of FCM on
peripheral muscles and global heart failure status.13,24,27
