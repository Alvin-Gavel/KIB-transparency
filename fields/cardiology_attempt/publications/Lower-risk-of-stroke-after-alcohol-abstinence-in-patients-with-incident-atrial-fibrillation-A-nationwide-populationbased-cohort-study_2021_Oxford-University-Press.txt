this is not enough', by A.M. Russo, https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab657.

Aims

The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between alcohol consumption status (and its changes) after
newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation (AF) and the risk of ischaemic stroke.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
Using the Korean nationwide claims and health examination database, we included subjects who were newly diagand results
nosed with AF between 2010 and 2016. Patients were categorized into three groups according to the status of alcohol consumption before and after AF diagnosis: non-drinkers; abstainers from alcohol after AF diagnosis; and
current drinkers. The primary outcome was incident ischaemic stroke during follow-up. Non-drinkers, abstainers,
and current drinkers were compared using incidence rate differences after the inverse probability of treatment
weighting (IPTW). Among a total of 97 869 newly diagnosed AF patients, 51% were non-drinkers, 13% were
abstainers, and 36% were current drinkers. During 310 926 person-years of follow-up, 3120 patients were diagnosed with incident ischaemic stroke (10.0 per 1000 person-years). At 5-year follow-up, abstainers and nondrinkers were associated with a lower risk for stroke than current drinkers (incidence rate differences after
IPTW, -2.03 [-3.25, -0.82] for abstainers and -2.98 [-3.81, -2.15] for non-drinkers, per 1000 person-years, respectively; and incidence rate ratios after IPTW, 0.75 [0.70, 0.81] for non-drinkers and 0.83 [0.74, 0.93] for abstainers,
respectively).

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
Current alcohol consumption was associated with an increased risk of ischaemic stroke in patients with newly diagnosed AF, and alcohol abstinence after AF diagnosis could reduce the risk of ischaemic stroke. Lifestyle intervention, including attention to alcohol consumption, should be encouraged as part of a comprehensive approach to
AF management to improve clinical outcomes.

Introduction
Alcohol consumption is associated with an increased risk of incident
atrial fibrillation (AF).1-3 Not only heavy drinking but also a "low
spectrum of alcohol consumption" could be a risk factor for incident
AF, as reported in a recent observational study.4 Regarding the risk of
AF, alcohol consumption showed a consistent linear dose-response
relationship.2-4
While the association and dose-response relationship between alcohol consumption and the risk of AF is well-established, the association between drinking alcohol and stroke is more controversial. In
the general population, the overall association of alcohol intake with
the risk of stroke was almost null, and the association with ischaemic
stroke showed a marginal reduction.5 In several prior studies, the
associations between alcohol consumption and cardiovascular risk,
including ischaemic stroke, are varied depending on whether the
study focused on an immediate effect or long-term effect or alcohol
dose in the general population.6-10 The relationship between alcohol
consumption and incident stroke in patients with AF per se remains
unclear.11
In a recent study, alcohol abstinence reduced AF recurrence in
patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF.12 Alcohol abstinence in

AF patients with moderate to heavy drinking showed a significant reduction in the recurrence of AF and AF burden compared to those
who continue their alcohol consumption. However, this study did
not report the reduction of hard clinical endpoints (e.g., stroke).
Physicians also need to consider the potentially beneficial effect of
low amounts of alcohol on the cardiovascular outcome (at least in
the general population), but they should also consider the effect of alcohol on AF management. Considering that a greater burden of AF
has associated with a higher risk of ischaemic stroke in patients with
AF,13 we still need evidence of whether alcohol abstinence would reduce the risk of ischaemic stroke in patients with AF, especially from
a large population-based perspective. These data would help physicians how to make recommendations on drinking alcohol to their
patients with newly diagnosed AF.
Implementation of a healthy lifestyle is an important part of guideline-recommended optimal care of patients with AF.14 When a new
disease is diagnosed, it can be a good opportunity to intervene with
respect to the patient's lifestyle. Although there was some evidence
on the clinical impact of lifestyle modification in patients with AF, we
still need more evidence-based recommendations to inform guidelines, e.g. to educate and encourage 'alcohol abstinence' among
patients who are newly diagnosed with AF.

Alcohol abstinence after atrial fibrillation diagnosis could reduce the risk of ischaemic stroke. Lifestyle intervention, including attention to alcohol consumption, should be encouraged as part of a comprehensive approach to atrial fibrillation management to improve clinical outcomes.

Alcohol abstinence and risk of stroke in AF patients

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the associations between alcohol consumption status (especially abstaining alcohol after newly
diagnosed AF) and the risk of ischaemic stroke in a population-based
nationwide observational cohort.

Methods

Patients with missing values in the health examination data were
excluded. To enhance accuracy in the diagnosis of stroke as a primary
outcome, we excluded patients with a prior history of stroke before the
second health examination (index date). Detailed definitions of the diagnoses, namely, AF, valvular AF, and prior stroke, are presented in
Supplementary material online, Table S1.15,16
Alcohol consumption status was evaluated using a self-reported questionnaire at the first and second health examinations. Subjects were categorized into three groups based on the status of alcohol consumption
before and after the diagnosis of AF: (i) non-drinkers; (ii) abstainers from
alcohol after the diagnosis of AF; and (iii) current drinkers, including sustained (persistent) drinkers and new drinkers after the diagnosis of AF
(Figure 1). Data on the frequency of alcohol intake per week (0-7) and
amount of alcohol intake per session (0 to <_32 g, 32 to <_56 g, 56 to

Study design and study population
The study design and flowchart of population enrolment are presented in
Figures 1 and 2, respectively. We included subjects who were newly diagnosed with AF between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2016 (n = 523
174). Patients diagnosed with valvular AF and those younger than
20 years of age were excluded. Patients who underwent health examinations within 2 years before and after the diagnosis of AF were included.

We used data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service
(NHIS) and the National Health Screening databases for our analysis.15
The Korean NHIS is a mandatory health insurance coverage provided by
the government for the entire Korean population (50 million people).
The Korean NHIS database includes demographic information as well as
information related to the medical records and expenses of enrolees,
such as diagnoses, examinations, prescriptions, and procedures.
Diagnoses were coded using the International Classification of Diseases,
Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification codes. We also used data from the
National Health Screening database linked with the Korean NHIS database. All enrolees of the Korean NHIS aged 40 years or older are recommended to undergo a biennial health screening. The health examination
includes anthropometric measurement, assessment of blood pressure, laboratory investigations, as well as a self-reported questionnaire on health
behaviours such as smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical activity.
The present study complied with the Declaration of Helsinki. This study
was exempted from review by the institutional review board of Seoul
National University Hospital (E-2007-071-1141).

<_112 g, and >112 g) were obtained from the self-reported questionnaire
(Supplementary material online, Methods).3 Based on the frequency per
week and amount per session, we classified the amount of alcohol consumption per week as mild (0 to <105 g), moderate (105 to <210 g), and
heavy (>_210 g).

Covariates

Study outcomes and follow-up
The primary outcome was the incidence of ischaemic stroke during follow-up. A detailed definition of the primary outcome is presented in
Supplementary material online, Table S1.15,16 We defined the index date
of follow-up as the second health examination date, which was performed within two years after AF diagnosis (Figure 1). Patients were followed up starting from the index date until the occurrence of ischaemic
stroke, death, or end of the study period (31 December 2017), whichever came first (Figure 1).

Statistical analysis
Continuous variables are presented as mean +/- standard deviation, and
categorical variables are presented as numbers (percentages). One-way
analysis of variance and the chi-square test were used to evaluate the significance of the differences among groups categorized by alcohol status.
The incidence rate (IR) of ischaemic stroke was calculated by dividing the
number of incident cases by the total follow-up period and presented as
per 1000 person-years. The hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for ischaemic stroke were analysed using the Cox proportional
hazards model.
To compare the three groups, including non-drinker, abstainer, and
current drinker, after balancing the differences in baseline characteristics,
we performed inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) analysis
by using stabilized weights calculated from propensity score (PS).17,18
The propensity for being in each group was calculated using a logistic regression model with baseline covariates that included age, sex, comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidaemia, heart failure,
prior myocardial infarction, peripheral artery disease, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, and cancer; baseline medications including oral anticoagulants (OACs), antiplatelet agents, and statins,
baseline body mass index, smoking status, regular exercise, low income,
and CHA2DS2-VASc score.19 To evaluate the balance of baseline characteristics among three groups, the maximum absolute standardized difference (ASD) was calculated in each covariate. The maximum ASD of <_0.1
indicates that there is a negligible difference in a certain covariate among
three groups.20 Weighted cumulative incidence curve was presented
with weighted IR, IR difference (IRD) with 95% CI, IR ratios (IRR) with
95% CIs with consideration of the IPTW using PS. The risk for ischaemic
stroke of the three groups was obtained using weighted Cox proportional hazards regression models with IPTW. HRs are presented with current
drinkers as the reference group.
The proportional hazards assumption was tested by graphical inspection of log-minus-log plot and Schoenfeld residuals for Cox models. The
results showed parallel log-minus-log survival curves and random patterns in Schoenfeld residuals, indicating no significant departure from the
proportionality assumption.
A P-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. We used
SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) for statistical analyses.

..
.. Sensitivity analyses
.. First, to provide complementary analyses, we performed a multivariable..
.. adjusted Cox proportional hazards model analysis. The multivariable
.. model was adjusted for the same variables that included PS calculation.
.. Before creating a final adjusted model, models that were adjusted sequen..
.. tially based on a priori considerations for baseline covariates were also
.. evaluated (models 1-5,Supplementary material online, Methods). HRs are
..
.. presented with non-drinkers as the reference group and also presented
.. with current drinkers as the reference group to more intuitively present
.. the relative risk (RR) of each group compared to current drinkers.
..
..
Second, focusing on the beneficial effect of alcohol abstinence after AF
.. diagnosis, PS matching (PSM) analysis was performed between the ab..
.. stainer group and current drinker group. The propensity for being in each
.. group was calculated using a logistic regression model with baseline cova..
.. riates included in the final multivariable Cox analysis.19 Patients were
.. matched in a one-to-one manner between the two groups using the
.. greedy, nearest-neighbor method without replacement with a calliper of
..
.. 0.01 of the PS.21 The balance of baseline characteristics between two
.. groups was evaluated using the ASD. An ASD of <_0.1 (10%) indicates
..
.. that study groups were well balanced.20 After PSM between the two
.. groups, the cumulative incidence curve of PS matched cohort was pre.. sented with IR, IRD with 95% CI, and IRR with 95% CI.
..
..
Third, we performed a competing risk analysis considering death as a
.. competing risk using the Fine and Gray proportional hazards model for
..
.. the subdistribution of a competing risk.22
..
..
.. Subgroup analyses
.. The potential effect modification by sex, age (<65 years, 65-74 years, and
..
.. >_75 years), underlying stroke risk of patients assessed by the CHA2DS2.. VASc score (<3 and >_3), and baseline smoking status (never smoker, ex.. smoker, and current smoker) were evaluated by subgroup analyses and
..
.. interaction tests. To account for the possible influence of the accumula.. tive alcohol intake, we stratified each group based on alcohol intake per
..
.. week at the first health examination. In addition, to account for the im.. pact of current alcohol consumption and the risk of ischaemic stroke, we
.. categorized each group based on the frequency of drinking per week, al..
.. cohol amount per session, and the total amount of alcohol intake per
.. week at the second health examination. Subgroup analyses performed
..
.. using multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression methods and P
.. for interaction <0.1 was considered significant interaction.
..
..
..
.. Results

..
.. A total of 97 869 patients newly diagnosed with AF (mean age

.. 61.3 +/- 12.3 years, 62.4% men, mean CHA2DS2-VASc score 2.3 +/- 1.5)

with respect to ischaemic stroke between different groups categorized by alcohol status and all subgroups (Supplementary material online, Figure S2).

Alcohol consumption amount at the first
health examination
To account for the influence of previous cumulative alcohol intake,
abstainers and current drinkers were stratified according to the
amount of alcohol intake per week as described in the Methods
section (mild [0 to <105 g], moderate [105 to <210 g], and heavy
[>_210 g]). Event numbers and crude IRs are presented in
Supplementary material online, Table S6. As shown in Supplementary
material online, Figure S3, abstainers who consumed mild or moderate amounts of alcohol per week and stopped drinking after the diagnosis of AF had a similar risk of ischaemic stroke as non-drinkers. Exheavy drinkers showed a significantly higher risk of ischaemic stroke
than non-drinkers, despite the cessation of drinking after the diagnosis of AF (adjusted HR 1.433, 95% CI 1.122-1.831). All current
drinkers showed a higher risk of ischaemic stroke compared to nondrinkers, regardless of the amount of alcohol consumed previously.

current drinkers (Graphical abstract). These observations have implications for promoting lifestyle modifications as part of the holistic
and integrated approach in the care of patients with AF.14,23
The strengths of the present study lie in the inclusion of a large
number of patients who were available for serial health examination before and after the diagnosis of AF. Based on the availability
of the serial self-reported questionnaires before and after the diagnosis of AF, we identified non-drinkers, abstainers, and current
drinkers and demonstrated the association between each alcohol
intake status and the risk of ischaemic stroke in the patients after
the diagnosis of AF.
Alcohol consumption has been reported to be associated with an
increased risk of incident AF, and a linear dose-response relationship
is well established between the two parameters.1-4 Binge drinking, as
well as habitual alcohol consumption, has been implicated in the
increased risk of developing AF.3 Excessive alcohol consumption
causes acute electrophysiological effects, including decreased atrial
effective refractory period and slow intra-atrial conduction.24 Binge
drinking also increases the susceptibility to atrial arrhythmias by mishandling of calcium in the sarcoplasmic reticulum.25
Alcohol exposure may lead to atrial electrical and structural
remodelling. The atrial tissue has been reported to be more susceptible to toxicity even at lower doses of alcohol than doses associated

with alcohol-induced cardiomyopathy in the ventricles.26 Thus, regular mild-to-moderate consumption of alcohol has been associated
with lower atrial voltages or the presence of low-voltage zones, conduction slowing, and enlargement of the left atrium.27-29 In a recent
randomized clinical trial that included regular drinkers with AF,
abstainers showed significantly lower recurrence and burden of AF
compared to sustained drinkers.12 Proactive abstinence from alcohol
intake is therefore recommended in patients with AF to control AF
itself. Moreover, the reduction of recurrence and burden of AF might
lower AF-related complications.13
Although the amount of alcohol intake shows a linear relationship
with incident AF, and alcohol abstinence is an important modifiable
factor for effective rhythm control in patients with AF, there has been
limited evidence on recommendations regarding optimal care of such
patients, especially in relation to stroke prevention. In the general
population, the association between alcohol intake and the risk of
stroke showed a U-shaped relationship, wherein light to moderate alcohol consumption was associated with a reduced risk of stroke compared to abstinence.5,7,10,30 However, there has been no definitive
answer to the question of whether a U-shaped relationship exists between alcohol intake and the risk of stroke in the population with AF.

an increased risk of the composite of thromboembolism and death in

.. Focusing on the management of comorbidities.14,23,41 The results of
.. the present study provide support for lifestyle changes in the manage..
.. ment of patients with AF, wherein proactive reduction and abstinence
.. from alcohol consumption were associated with better outcomes.
..
..
..
.. Study limitations
.. This study had several limitations. First, alcohol intake could affect
..
.. comorbidities, such as hypertension and obesity, and these conditions
.. could also be modifiable risk factors associated with stroke.14 To minim..
.. ize this, we adjusted for the comorbidities evaluated at the second
.. examination; however, a possibility of residual confounding persists.
..
.. Second, alcohol status was evaluated using a self-reported question.. naire, which could be associated with recall bias. Nonetheless, many
..
.. published retrospective and prospective observational studies, or even
.. randomized controlled trials, have collected information about alcohol
..
.. intake using similar self-reported questionnaires.1-3,12 Third, the benefi.. cial effect of alcohol abstinence and the dose-response relationship be..
.. tween the amount of alcohol intake and the risk of stroke might be
.. mediated by atrial electrical/structural remodelling and the burden of ar..
.. rhythmia. However, this aspect could not be evaluated, considering the
..
.. inherent limitation of the database. Lastly, the impact of heavy drinking
.. in the general population on the risk of stroke differs according to the
..
.. subtype of stroke (ischaemic vs. haemorrhagic).5,30 For example, the RR
.. of haemorrhagic stroke was higher (RR, 2.18) than that of ischaemic
..
.. stroke (RR 1.69) due to heavy drinking (>60 g/day).30 Furthermore, the
.. association between alcohol consumption and the RR of stroke was J..
.. shaped for ischaemic and linear-shaped for haemorrhagic stroke.30 In
.. the present study, we focused on ischaemic stroke, especially since data
..
.. on haemorrhagic stroke could not be differentiated from claims data.. bases of intracranial haemorrhage due to other causes.
..
..
..
..
.. Conclusion
..
..
.. Current alcohol consumption was associated with an increased risk
.. of ischaemic stroke in patients with newly diagnosed AF. Compared
..
.. to non-drinkers, current drinkers with mild amount of alcohol con.. sumption still showed a significantly higher risk of ischaemic stroke
..
.. and a linear dose-response relationship between the amount of cur.. rent alcohol intake and the risk of ischaemic stroke. Furthermore, al..
.. cohol abstinence after the diagnosis of AF could reduce the risk of
.. ischaemic stroke. Lifestyle interventions, including attention to alco..
.. hol consumption, should be encouraged as part of a comprehensive
.. approach in the management of patients with a new diagnosis of AF

the population with AF.11 However, this result was mainly driven by
death, and the numbers were insufficient to address the beneficial effect of abstinence from alcohol and establish a dose-response relationship for the risk of stroke.11 Al-Khalili et al.31 reported that prior
alcohol-related hospitalization was associated with a two-fold
increased risk of ischaemic stroke in young patients with AF (18-
64 years, median 55 years) at low risk for ischaemic stroke stratified
by CHA2DS2-VASc score (0 in men and 1 in women). However, a
direct relationship between alcohol intake and ischaemic stroke was
not demonstrated in this prior study.31
The present study showed that any amount of current alcohol intake in patients with AF was associated with a higher risk of ischaemic
stroke compared to non-drinkers. Moreover, there was a linear
dose-response relationship between the amount of current alcohol
intake and the risk of ischaemic stroke. Furthermore, abstinence
from alcohol might reduce the risk of ischaemic stroke in patients
with newly diagnosed AF.
The differences in the population with AF compared to the general population could be explained by several mechanisms. In previous studies, light to moderate regular alcohol intake was also
reported to cause electrical and structural atrial remodelling, which
eventually led to atrial myopathy.27-29 The latter refers to atrial fibrotic remodelling with electrical and autonomic remodelling, associated with an increased risk of stroke.32 In patients with
AF, the presence of any AF events lasting over 6 min was found to
be associated with an increased risk of stroke, which was even
greater in cases with the AF burden lasting over 24 h.33 Thus, reduction in the recurrence and the burden of arrhythmia by alcohol
abstinence might be beneficial in preventing stroke in patients with
AF.12 Although the cumulative incidence between abstainer and
current drinker groups was not significantly different in the early
period (<1 year), the absolute difference of IR and IRR after 2-year
follow-up remained consistent. We assumed that the beneficial effect of alcohol abstinence, such as reduction of AF burden and
atrial reverse remodelling, might need time to present as a risk reduction of hard endpoint (e.g. stroke).
To evaluate the risk of stroke in patients with AF, the impact of age
is crucial.34-36 Before IPTW, current drinkers were younger than
abstainers and non-drinkers, and the crude IRs of ischaemic stroke
were higher in non-drinkers and abstainers than current drinkers
(10.7, 9.7, and 9.3 per 1000 person-years, respectively, in Figure 4A).
After IPTW, age differences were well-balanced, and weighted IRs
of ischaemic stroke were highest in current drinkers (11.7 per 1000
person-years) than in abstainers and non-drinkers (10.1 per 1000
person-years and 8.8 per 1000 person-years, respectively). Hence,
although age is a strong factor associated with the risk of stroke, nondrinkers and abstainers showed significantly lower risks of stroke
than current drinkers after balancing the baseline characteristics. In
the subgroup analysis by age, the P-for-interaction was not significant;
however, the beneficial effect of abstinence from alcohol was attenuated in patients aged 75 years or older. This finding could be
explained by the strong association between age and the risk of
stroke.34-36 Age is the strongest risk factor for AF-related stroke and
is also associated with irreversible remodelling of a substrate in the
left atrium.37-40
Given the increased focus on integrated care of patients with AF,
lifestyle changes are part of the 'C' criterion of the ABC pathway,
