Aims

Our previous study demonstrated that Ca2th influx through the Orai1 store-operated Ca2th channel in macrophages contributes to foam cell formation and atherosclerosis via the calcineurin-ASK1 pathway, not the classical
calcineurin-nuclear factor of activated T-cell (NFAT) pathway. Moreover, up-regulation of NFATc3 in macrophages
inhibits foam cell formation, suggesting that macrophage NFATc3 is a negative regulator of atherogenesis. Hence,
this study investigated the precise role of macrophage NFATc3 in atherogenesis.

sclerosis in a mouse model of adeno-associated virus-mutant PCSK9-induced atherosclerosis. NFATc3 expression was decreased in macrophages within human and mouse atherosclerotic lesions. Moreover, NFATc3 levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from atherosclerotic patients were negatively associated with plaque
instability. Furthermore, macrophage-specific ablation of NFATc3 in mice led to the atherosclerotic plaque
formation, whereas macrophage-specific NFATc3 transgenic mice exhibited the opposite phenotype. NFATc3
deficiency in macrophages promoted foam cell formation by potentiating SR-A- and CD36-meditated lipid uptake. NFATc3 directly targeted and transcriptionally up-regulated miR-204 levels.

Translational Perspective
Here, we show that NFATc3 levels in circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells are negatively associated with disease severity in
patients with atherosclerosis. Macrophage-specific knockout of NFATc3 promotes foam cell formation and atherosclerosis development in mice. Mechanistically, miR-204 is the direct target of NFATc3 and relays the inhibitory effects of NFATc3 on atherosclerosis.
This study provides the first evidence that macrophage NFATc3 is an essential inhibitor of atherogenesis, suggesting that the NFATc3/
miR-204 axis is a promising therapeutic target for atherosclerosis treatment. Furthermore, our results suggest that inhibition of calcineurin/NFAT signalling may underlie the proatherogenic effects of cyclosporine A and FK506.

Introduction
Atherosclerosis is a chronic progressive inflammatory disease involving the synergistic interaction of lipid metabolic factors with the cellular components of the vessels.1,2 Formation of macrophage-derived
foam cells is the hallmark of atherosclerosis.1,3 During atherogenesis,
monocytes are differentiated into macrophages in the subendothelial
space and internalize oxidized low-density lipoproteins (oxLDL)

through scavenger receptors such as SR-A and CD36.4 The interplay
between the scavenger receptors and oxLDL in macrophages induces the secretion of cytokines that recruits immune cells into the vascular wall. Increased uptake of oxLDL and/or reduced cholesterol
efflux leads to lipid dysregulation in macrophages and promotes foam
cell formation, triggering a series of inflammatory responses, ultimately establishing plaque formation and atherosclerotic lesions.3 The

Results
Down-regulation of NFATc3 in
macrophages during atherogenesis
We found that NFATc3 is a predominant isoform and highly
expressed in human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDMs) and
mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) (Sup

..
.. plementary material online, Figure S1A and B). In the plaques of ca.. rotid arteries from atherosclerosis patients, the nuclear accumulation
..
.. of NFATc3 in macrophages was reduced, compared with in those
.. from healthy controls (Figure 1A). Reduced nuclear accumulation of
..
.. NFATc3 in macrophages was also observed in the atherosclerotic
.. lesions of Apoe-/- mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) (Figure 1B) and in
..
.. HMDMs and mouse BMDMs treated with oxLDL (Figure 1C and D).
.. However, oxLDL treatment barely affected the distribution of
..
.. NFATc1, NFATc2, and NFATc4 in BMDMs (Supplementary material
.. online, Figure S1C-E). Furthermore, oxLDL treatment reduced
..
.. NFATc3 mRNA levels in both the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions
.. of HMDMs and BMDMs (Figure 1E). To validate the NFATc3 down..
.. regulation, we determined the NFATc3 mRNA levels in circulating
.. PBMCs from patients with carotid atherosclerosis. NFATc3 mRNA
..
.. levels were consistently lower in both asymptomatic and symptomat.. ic patients than in the healthy controls. Notably, NFATc3 levels in
..
.. symptomatic patients were lower than those in the asymptomatic
.. patients (Figure 1F), suggesting that the decreased NFATc3 levels in
..
.. macrophages may be causally related to plaque instability. Moreover,
.. we explored the potential mechanism whereby oxLDL attenuates
..
.. NFATc3 levels. c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signalling has been
..
.. revealed to promote NFATc3 translocation from the nucleus to the
.. cytoplasm.18,19 Previous studies showed that JNK could be activated
..
.. by oxLDL in macrophages.17,20,21 We found that specific inhibition of
.. JNK signalling led to the nuclear retention of NFATc3 (Figure 1G),
..
.. indicating that JNK signalling activation contributes to the NFATc3
.. nuclear export during lipid challenge.

..
.. To investigate the role of macrophage NFATc3 in atherosclerosis,
.. we generated myeloid-specific NFATc3 knockout mice (LysM-Cre..
.. NFATc3Flox), hereafter referred to as NFATc3MKO mice (Supplemen.. tary material online, Figure S2A and B). The null allele was confirmed
..
.. in BMDMs from NFATc3MKO mice. NFATc3 depletion did not alter
.. the expression of other NFAT isoforms in macrophages (Supplemen..
.. tary material online, Figure S2C). Atherosclerosis was induced in mice
.. via the tail-vein injection of an adeno-associated virus (AAV8) encod..
.. ing the Asp374-to-Tyr mutant version of human PCSK9 (PCSK9DY)
..
.. followed by HFD feeding (Supplementary material online, Figure
.. S2D). The PCSK9DY mutation directly targets hepatocytes by inducing
..
.. degradation of hepatic low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR),
.. therefore resembling that of LDLR-/- mice.22 As expected, the LDLR
..
.. protein was almost undetectable in the liver after AAV-PCSK9DY in.. fection (Supplementary material online, Figure S2E). Deletion of
..
.. NFATc3 in macrophages did not affect the body weight or serum
.. lipid levels of mice fed a chow diet or HFD (Supplementary material
..
.. online, Figure S2F-J). No distinct plaques were observed in chow diet.. fed NFATc3Flox or NFATc3MKO mice after AAV-PCSK9DY infection.
..
.. Notably, NFATc3MKO mice fed an HFD showed larger plaque areas in
.. aortas and aortic roots than HFD-fed NFATc3Flox mice, as assessed by
..
.. Oil Red O staining (Figure 2A and B). Further analysis of the plaques in
.. aortic roots revealed that the atherosclerotic lesion and necrotic

.. core areas were increased, but the collagen content decreased in
.. NFATc3MKO mice (Figure 2C-E). More detailed assessment of the

. composition of aortic root plaques indicated that NFATc3MKO mice

with their enrichment within the plaques makes macrophages as a
promising therapeutic target in atherosclerosis.4
The nuclear factor of activated T-cell (NFAT) family proteins was
first identified as the transcription factors activated by the Ca2th/calcineurin signalling in T cells.5 NFATs consist of four well-characterized
members (NFATc1-c4).5 Because NFATs play critical roles in regulating the cytokine expression in T cells, the drugs that block the calcineurin/NFAT signalling, including cyclosporine A and FK506, have
been widely used as immunosuppressive agents in organ transplant
patients.6-8 Meanwhile, it has been increasingly recognized that
NFATs also play various roles outside the immune system.9,10
Several studies have shown that NFATs function as important regulators of genes implicated in cardiovascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis.11-13 However, individual NFAT isoforms exhibit different
effects on cardiovascular diseases.9,10,13 A better understanding of
the roles of NFAT signalling in the cardiovascular system may help
develop new therapeutic strategies for cardiovascular diseases.
Notably, clinical monitoring of the transplant patients with cyclosporine A or FK506 therapy has revealed that cardiovascular diseases, particularly atherosclerosis, are widespread and the most
common cause of mortality among these patients, surpassing even
infections.14,15 The mechanisms underlying these adverse effects are
assumed to be associated with metabolic, inflammatory, and coagulatory disorders.7,14,16 Whether the blockade of calcineurin/NFAT is
directly involved in these adverse effects is still a mystery. Recently,
we reported that the hyperlipidaemia-induced Ca2th influx in macrophages via Orai1 store-operated Ca2th channel contributes to the
foam cell formation and atherosclerosis.17 The increase in intracellular Ca2th concentration ([Ca2th]i) promotes atherosclerosis by activating calcineurin/ASK1signalling, but not calcineurin/NFATc3
signalling. Furthermore, overexpression of NFATc3 in macrophages
has been shown to inhibit foam cell formation.17 Together, these
data indicate that the activation of NFATc3 in macrophages may prevent atherogenesis. However, the exact functions of macrophage
NFATc3 signalling during atherogenesis have not yet been elucidated.
This study aims to investigate the functional significance of macrophage NFATc3 in atherosclerosis. The results demonstrated that
NFATc3 expression is reduced in peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (PBMCs) and plaques of atherosclerotic patients. Macrophagespecific knockout of NFATc3 potentiates atherosclerotic lesion formation, whereas macrophage NFATc3 prevents atherogenesis by
down-regulating the scavenger receptors SR-A and CD36 via miR204 axis.

cells (Figure 2F and G). However, the smooth muscle cell, dead cell, or
proliferating cell content of the plaques was not altered (Figure 2H
and Supplementary material online, Figure S2K and L).
Next, we performed bone marrow transplantation to confirm the
effects of NFATc3 macrophage-specific ablation on atherosclerosis
in an Apoe-/- background. Apoe-/- male mice were lethally irradiated

Apoe-/- mice that received the bone marrow from NFATc3MKO mice

collagen content was decreased in the plaques of NFATc3MKO/Apoe-/chimaeras, while the macrophage and T-cell counts increased (Figure
3G-I). No significant differences in body weight or serum lipid levels
were found between the two groups (Supplementary material online,
Figure S3).

NFATc3 overexpression inhibits

NFATc3 depletion promotes foam cell
formation and scavenger receptor
expression
Next, we examined the potential role of NFATc3 in the formation of
macrophage-derived foam cells. NFATc3MKO BMDMs showed
enhanced foam cell formation and lipid accumulation compared with
NFATc3Flox BMDMs (Figure 5A-C). The opposite effects were
observed in NFATc3-overexpressing TEPMs (Supplementary material online, Figure S5A-C). To investigate whether the increased binding
or uptake of modified lipoproteins accounts for the enhanced foam
cell formation in NFATc3-deficient macrophages, we performed the
binding and uptake assay with Dil-oxLDL. Immunofluorescence
revealed that the oxLDL-induced increase in Dil-oxLDL binding and
uptake was potentiated in NFATc3MKO BMDMs but suppressed in
NFATc3MTG TEPMs (Figure 5D and E and Supplementary material

..
.. online, Figure S5D and E). To delineate the mechanism whereby
.. NFATc3 ablation increases foam cell formation, the expression of
..
.. scavenger receptors and transporters was determined. Deletion of
.. NFATc3 increased SR-A and CD36 expression in BMDMs and
..
.. TEPMs, but barely affected the expression of scavenger receptor
.. LOX-1 or cholesterol transporters, such as SRB-1 and ABCG1
..
.. (Figure 5F and Supplementary material online, Figure S6A).
.. Interestingly, knockdown of NFATc1, NFATc2, or NFATc4 in
..
.. TEPMs did not alter the expression of SR-A or CD36
.. (Supplementary material online, Figure S6B). Immunofluorescence
..
.. measurement confirmed that the SR-A and CD36 levels were
.. increased in macrophages within the lesions of NFATc3MKO mice com..
.. pared with those in NFATc3Flox mice (Figure 5G). Conversely, the
.. TEPMs and aortic roots from NFATc3MTG mice showed a decreased
..
.. SR-A and CD36 expression (Supplementary material online, Figure
.. S6C-E). The enhanced foam cell formation, as well as oxLDL binding
..
.. and uptake, was suppressed upon the antibody-mediated neutraliza.. tion of SR-A or CD36. Importantly, the neutralization of both SR-A
..
.. and CD36 exhibited clear synergistic effects (Supplementary material
.. online, Figure S7). These findings indicate that the proatherogenesis in
..
.. NFATc3MKO mice results from the up-regulation of SR-A and CD36 in
..
.. macrophages.
..
Correlation analysis revealed that the PBMC NFATc3 levels were
..
.. negatively correlated with the SR-A and CD36 levels in normal con.. trols and carotid atherosclerosis patients (Figure 5H and I), further
..
.. suggesting that NFATc3 regulates SR-A and CD36 expression. We
.. searched for potential NFATc3-binding sites in the promoters of
..
.. SR-A and CD36 (within the -2.0 kb fragment upstream of the tran.. scription start site) by using the JASPAR database. Consequently,
..
.. four potential sites were predicted in each promoter region.
.. However, ChIP-qPCR revealed that the NFATc3 enrichment on ei..
.. ther sites of the SR-A and CD36 promoter fragments did not differ
.. from IgG control (Supplementary material online, Figure S8A). We
..
.. also assessed whether NFATc3 directly binds to SR-A and CD36 at
.. the mRNA or protein levels but observed no such interaction

.. (Supplementary material online, Figure S8B-E). Collectively, these

To further verify the functional role of macrophage NFATc3 in atherosclerosis, we established macrophage-specific NFATc3 transgenic
mice (NFATc3MTG), which were crossed with Apoe-/- mice to obtain
NFATc3MTG/Apoe-/- mice (Supplementary material online, Figure S4A-
C). NFATc3 expression was higher in thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages (TEPMs) from NFATc3MTG/Apoe-/- mice than in those
from Apoe-/- mice (Supplementary material online, Figure S4D). The
body weight and serum lipid levels of NFATc3MTG/Apoe-/- mice were
not different from those of Apoe-/- mice fed a chow diet or HFD
(Supplementary material online, Figure S4E-I). The total plaque areas
were comparable between the mice with either genotype that
received a chow diet. However, after HFD feeding, the plaque areas
in NFATc3MTG/Apoe-/- mice decreased relative to those in Apoe-/- mice
(Figure 4A and B). In addition, reduced lesion and necrotic core areas
and increased collagen content were observed in the aortic roots of
NFATc3MTG/Apoe-/- mice (Figure 4C-E). The infiltration of macrophages and T cells in plaques was inhibited in these mice, compared
with that in Apoe-/- mice (Figure 4F and G). However, the number of
dead or proliferating cells did not change (Supplementary material
online, Figure S4J and K). Serum levels of monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 and interleukin (IL)-1b decreased significantly, whereas
the IL-6 and IL-10 levels increased in NFATc3MTG/Apoe-/- mice (Figure
4H). In vehicle- (resting), lipopolysaccharide/interferon-c (LPS/IFNc)-, or IL-4-treated TEPMs, NFATc3 overexpression was associated
with increased IL-10 mRNA levels. In addition, NFATc3MTG TEPMs
showed decreased MCP-1 mRNA levels and increased arginase 1
mRNA levels upon LPS/IFN-c or IL-4 treatment. Of note, in contrast
to resting or IL-4-treated macrophages, NFATc3 up-regulation
decreased IL-6 mRNA levels in LPS/IFN-c-treated TEPMs (Figure 4I).
Together, these results suggest that NFATc3 converts proinflammatory macrophages into those with an anti-inflammatory
phenotype.

204-5p was also up-regulated in Ad-NFATc3-treated HMDMs (Figure
6B). The luciferase assay showed that NFATc3 up-regulation led to a
4-fold increase in miR-204 promoter activity, and a serial promoter
deletion analysis further showed that the functional NFATc3 site was
centred on an evolutionarily conserved site that is approximately
-1.5 kb upstream of the miR-204 gene (Figure 6C and Supplementary
material online, Figure S9C). ChIP-qPCR results confirmed that
NFATc3 was enriched in this region of the miR-204 promoter (Figure
6D), suggesting that NFATc3 directly targets miR-204. miR-204 is an
evolutionarily conserved miRNA located in intron 6 of the human
TRPM3 gene, and the NFATc3-binding site on the miR-204 promoter

is located in intron 1 of the TRPM3 gene (Supplementary material online, Figure S9D). NFATc3 up-regulation increased the levels of miR204 precursor (pre-miR-204) in TEPMs and HMDMs but did not alter
TRPM3 expression (Supplementary material online, Figure S9E and F),
indicating that NFATc3 up-regulates miR-204 independent of the

To determine whether the NFATc3-mediated regulation of
miR-204 is implicated in atherosclerosis, the pre-miR-204 levels
in PBMCs and plaques of atherosclerotic patients were examined. The pre-miRNA-204 levels were decreased in PBMCs and

(Figure 6E-G). Similar findings were obtained in the aortic roots
of HFD-fed Apoe-/- mice vs. chow diet-fed Apoe-/- mice (Figure
6G). In addition, oxLDL stimulation decreased the enrichment of
NFATc3 on the miR-204 promoter (Figure 6H). Concomitantly,
oxLDL also inhibited the transcription of miR-204; this effect
was antagonized by NFATc3 up-regulation (Figure 6I). These
findings suggest that the inhibition of NFATc3 nuclear accumulation upon an atherogenic challenge contributes to the decreased

To clarify the relevant role of miR-204 in NFATc3-mediated
scavenger receptor expression and foam cell formation, we
treated macrophages with either mature miR-204-5p or miR-2043p mimics. The SR-A expression was decreased in BMDMs,
TEPMs, HMDMs, and Raw 264.7 cells treated with miR-204-5p
mimics, whereas the CD36 expression was not altered (Figure 6J).
Interestingly, miR-204-3p decreased CD36 expression but barely

thus confirming the role of miR-204 in NFATc3-mediated inhibition of scavenger receptor expression. miR-204-5p or miR-2043p up-regulation offset the enhanced effects of NFATc3 deficiency
on foam cell formation and lipid accumulation, whereas the inhibitory effects observed in NFATc3MTG TEPMs were reversed by miR204-5p or miR-204-3p inhibitor. The combination of the mimics
or inhibitors showed stronger effects than the individual treatments (Supplementary material online, Figures S10 and S11). In

of miR-204-3p with a mutated seed sequence had effects similar to
those of the miR-204-3p mimics transfection on CD36 expression in
HMDMs (Supplementary material online, Figure S12E and F). The
half-life of CD36 mRNA in HMDMs was also not altered by miR204-3p (Supplementary material online, Figure S12G).
Collectively, these results identified miR-204 as a candidate target
of NFATc3. Canonical inhibition of SR-A by miR-204-5p and non-canonical inhibition of CD36 by miR-204-3p lead to suppressed foam
cell formation.

The novelty of the miR-204-3p non-seed region repressing
CD36 expression prompted us to explore the biogenesis and
function of miR-204-3p in macrophages. To this end, we performed RNA sequencing in miR-204-3p mimics-treated
HMDMs, confirming decreased CD36 expression upon miR204-3p up-regulation, compared with the control group
(Supplementary material online, Figure S12H). Further Gene
Ontology analysis showed that the down-regulated genes were
enriched in nuclear function-related biology processes
(Supplementary material online, Figure S12I). Surprisingly, fluorescent in situ hybridization revealed that miR-204-3p was localized in the nuclei of macrophages, but not vascular smooth
muscle cells or endothelial cells (Figure 7A and Supplementary
material online, Figure S13A and B). qRT-PCR analysis further
confirmed the nuclear presence of miR-204-3p, which was suppressed by oxLDL. However, the miR-204-3p levels in the cytoplasmic fractions remained unchanged upon oxLDL challenge
(Figure 7B). Importantly, we observed little nuclear localization
of miR-204-5p in HMDMs, excluding the possibility of the nuclear trapping of unprocessed pre-miRNA-204 (Supplementary
material online, Figure S13C). Both cytoplasmic pre-miR-204 and
miR-204-5p levels were decreased by oxLDL (Supplementary
material online, Figure S13D). Since increasing evidence suggests
that Argonaute 2 (Ago2) is critical for the functions of miRNAs
in the nucleus,23,24 we investigated whether nuclear miR-204-3p,
together with Ago2, plays an epigenetic role in regulating CD36
expression. Ago2 was enriched in the nuclei of macrophages,
and miR-204-3p co-immunoprecipitated with Ago2 from the nuclear extracts (Figure 7C and Supplementary material online,
Figure S13E-G). The nuclear accumulation of Ago2 was increased
in BMDMs from HFD-fed Apoe-/- mice and in oxLDL-treated
HMDMs (Figure 7D and Supplementary material online, Figure
S13H). Knockdown of Ago2 inhibited the oxLDL-induced CD36
up-regulation (Supplementary material online, Figure S13I and J).
Both the luciferase reporter and nuclear run-on experiments
showed an miR-204-3p-dependent down-regulation of the
CD36 transcript levels; this effect was antagonized by Ago2
overexpression (Figure 7E and F). Nuclear Ago2 up-regulation
also abolished the miR-204-3p-induced down-regulation of
CD36 in HMDMs, and Ago2 knockdown suppressed the miR204-3p inhibitor-induced CD36 up-regulation (Figure 7G and Sup
plementary material online, Figure S13K and L). Reciprocally, the
Ago2 enrichment on the CD36 promoter was decreased by
miR-204-3p in HMDMs (Figure 7H). Using the RNAhybrid

A sustained increase in [Ca2th]i is known to induce nuclear translocation of NFATs through activation of the phosphatase calcineurin.5 Our previous study has shown that oxLDL activates a
sustained increase in [Ca2th]i.17 Unexpectedly, the present data
revealed that oxLDL treatment inhibited NFATc3 nuclear accumulation in macrophages. This result contrasts with the previous

cells, where the tumor necrosis factor-a-induced increase in [Ca2th]i
is sufficient to increase NFATc4 nuclear accumulation.26 The discrepancy may be due to the distinct sub-cellular distribution of NFATs in
different types of cells. Similar to a previous study revealing that
NFATc3 is confined to the nuclei of mouse BMDMs without stimulation,27 we showed that NFATc3 is preferentially localized in the

3p. However, whether the nuclear localization of miR-204-3p is primarily determined by this motif remains to be assessed.
Notably, it has been previously shown that the nucleus-localized
miRNAs participate in the epigenetic regulation via Ago2.23,24 These
observations differ from the traditional view of Ago2 being crucial for
miRNA function by targeting mRNA 30 -UTRs in the cytoplasm to induce post-transcriptional gene silencing.37,38 Herein, our data demonstrated that Ago2 could prevent the miR-204-3p-induced
inhibition and promote the oxLDL-induced increase in CD36 transcription. Moreover, miR-204-3p and Ago2 bind to a same region
within the CD36 promoter, indicating that they compete with each
other for the binding to the CD36 promoter. The reduced enrichment of the histone modifications H3K27ac and H3K4me3 on the
CD36 promoter further support the conclusion that miR-204-3p
inhibits CD36 transcription. Thus, we proposed a working model for
miR-204-3p in the nucleus in which nuclear miR-204-3p targets the
CD36 promoter and decreases the Ago2 occupancy on the CD36
promoter, causing the effects of Ago2 on CD36 transcription to be
suppressed.
Lipid-laden foam cells could induce cytokine secretion that recruits
immune cells into the vascular wall and triggers inflammation, thereby
promoting plaque formation.1,3 We found that macrophage-specific
NFATc3 up-regulation inhibited the recruitment of inflammatory
cells into lesional vessels. Under in vitro conditions of atherosclerosislike pathological stress, such as that induced by LPS/IFN-c, NFATc3
induced lesional macrophages to shift to an anti-inflammatory state,
thus limiting atherosclerosis progression. Intriguingly, our present
data showed that the systemic levels of both IL-6 (pro-inflammatory)
and IL-10 (anti-inflammatory) increased in NFATc3MTG mice. This
seemingly conflicting observation is similar to the results of a previous
study, which reported that IL-10 synthesis and secretion are suppressed in IL-6-deficient mice, whereby the recruitment of inflammatory cells to the atherosclerotic plaques was enhanced,39 suggesting
that a balanced interplay between IL-6 and IL-10 may determine the
perpetuation of atherogenesis. The anti-inflammatory role of macrophage NFATc3 differs from that reported in previous studies, which
showed that NFATs target inflammation-related genes.11,25,27 The inconsistency may be due to the counteracting effects of individual
NFAT isoforms that compensate for the NFATc3 global deficiency
(NFATc3-/-) and play distinct roles in inflammation.9,40 For example,
the absence of NFATc3 is compensated by NFATc1 expression in
the liver of NFATc3-/- mice,40 which may influence the phenotype of
macrophages, but this compensatory is unlikely to occur in
NFATc3MKO macrophages. Moreover, NFATc1 or NFATc3 knockdown has been shown to increase endothelial cell inflammation and
monocyte adhesion, whereas NFATc2 or NFATc4 knockdown
exerts opposite effects.9 Thus, these findings, together with those of
our study, highlight the importance of the isoform-specific manipulation of NFAT in specific settings.
In conclusion, we reported that macrophage NFATc3 exerts atheroprotective effects, which are primarily mediated by miR-204.
Cytoplasmic miR-204-5p and nuclear miR-204-3p cooperatively inhibit the expression of scavenger receptors, leading to a stronger and
more stable suppression of foam cell formation and atherosclerosis.
Furthermore, our findings suggest that the NFATc3/miR-204
axis may represent a potential novel therapeutic target against
atherosclerosis.

nuclei of human PBMCs and mouse BMDMs; however, other studies
have revealed that NFATc3 resides exclusively in the cytoplasm of
unstimulated vascular smooth muscle cells or cardiomyocytes.25,28
The nuclear localization of NFATc3 indicates that some molecules
relay the cytoplasmic signals to the nucleus and thus contribute to
the hyperlipidaemia-induced nuclear export of NFATc3. Indeed, several Ser/Thr protein kinases, including JNK, glycogen synthase kinase3b, and protein kinase A, have been suggested to target NFATc3 and
promote NFATc3 nuclear export.18,19 Our recent work has demonstrated that oxLDL activates the calcineurin/ASK1/JNK signalling
pathway in macrophages,17 suggesting the involvement of JNK activation in oxLDL-induced NFATc3 nuclear export. This was confirmed
in our present study, as blockade of JNK activation prevented the
oxLDL-induced NFATc3 nuclear export.
Macrophage NFATc3 prevents atherosclerosis by blocking foam
cell formation via inhibiting lipoprotein uptake, as evidenced by the
decreased SR-A and CD36 expression. Strikingly, NFATc3 did not
directly bind to the promoter of SR-A or CD36. By combining the
results from two distinct gene expression platforms, we identified
miR-204 as a high-confidence miRNA regulated by NFATc3.
Moreover, NFATc3 binds to the miR-204 promoter and increased
the miR-204 precursor levels. Previous studies have demonstrated
that miR-204-5p levels are decreased during atherosclerosis and
related metabolic diseases.29-31 Herein, we found that the miR-204
precursor levels were also decreased in circulating PBMCs and plaque lesions of atherosclerosis patients. Furthermore, oxLDL suppressed the transcription of miR-204 by inhibiting the binding of
NFATc3 to the miR-204 promoter, whereas NFATc3 restoration
abrogated the oxLDL-induced inhibition of miR-204 transcription.
More importantly, up-regulation of macrophage miR-204 reversed
the NFATc3 deficiency-mediated enhancement of foam cell formation and atherosclerosis. The atheroprotective effects of miR-204 are
consistent with those reported previously in endothelial cells,
smooth muscle cells, and macrophages.29,32,33 However, it has also
been reported that miR-204-5p induces endothelial dysfunction associated with atherosclerosis.31,34 The distribution of miR-204 upstream/downstream factors in diverse cell types, difference in
extracellular stresses, and complexity of miRNA interaction may explain these variable results. Further studies are needed to address the
precise functions of miR-204 in vascular cells. Collectively, these
results identify NFATc3 as a key transcriptional modulator of
oxLDL-mediated miR-204 down-regulation and suggest that the
NFATc3/miR-204 axis plays an important role in atherosclerosis.
In addition to the canonical interactions between miRNA seed
regions and targeted mRNA 30 -UTRs, increasing evidence has
revealed an unexpected cell-type-specific localization of mature
miRNAs in the nucleus, exerting additional and more widespread
functions.24,35,36 Herein, we are the first to demonstrate that miR204-3p is specifically localized in the nucleus of macrophages.
Moreover, we provided evidence that miR-204 regulates scavenger
receptor expression via dual mechanisms, including the canonical
post-transcriptional inhibition of SR-A via cytoplasmic miR-204-5p
and the silencing of CD36 transcription via nuclear miR-204-3p.
