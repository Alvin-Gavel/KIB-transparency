Aims

Patients at high bleeding risk (HBR) represent a prevalent subgroup among those undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Early aspirin discontinuation after a short course of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) has
emerged as a bleeding avoidance strategy. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of ticagrelor monotherapy
after 3-month DAPT in a contemporary HBR population.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
This prespecified analysis of the TWILIGHT trial evaluated the treatment effects of early aspirin withdrawal foland results
lowed by ticagrelor monotherapy in HBR patients undergoing PCI with drug-eluting stents. After 3 months of tica-

grelor plus aspirin, event-free patients were randomized to 12 months of aspirin or placebo in addition to ticagrelor. A total of 1064 (17.2%) met the Academic Research Consortium definition for HBR. Ticagrelor monotherapy
reduced the incidence of the primary endpoint of Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) 2, 3, or 5
bleeding compared with ticagrelor plus aspirin in HBR (6.3% vs. 11.4%; hazard ratio (HR) 0.53, 95% confidence
interval (CI) 0.35-0.82) and non-HBR patients (3.5% vs. 5.9%; HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.46-0.77) with similar relative
(Pinteraction = 0.67) but a trend towards greater absolute risk reduction in the former [-5.1% vs. -2.3%; difference in
absolute risk differences (ARDs) -2.8%, 95% CI -6.4% to 0.8%, P = 0.130]. A similar pattern was observed for more
severe BARC 3 or 5 bleeding with a larger absolute risk reduction in HBR patients (-3.5% vs. -0.5%; difference in

ARDs -3.0%, 95% CI -5.2% to -0.8%, P = 0.008). There was no significant difference in the key secondary endpoint
of death, myocardial infarction, or stroke between treatment arms, irrespective of HBR status.

Conclusions
Among HBR patients undergoing PCI who completed 3-month DAPT without experiencing major adverse events,
aspirin discontinuation followed by ticagrelor monotherapy significantly reduced bleeding without increasing ischaemic events, compared with ticagrelor plus aspirin. The absolute risk reduction in major bleeding was larger in HBR
than non-HBR patients.

Introduction
For over 20 years, a combination of aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor
has been the mainstay antithrombotic strategy in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).1 This drug combination, referred to as dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), has been
proven superior to aspirin alone in preventing cardiovascular
events after stent implantation, although at the expense of
increased bleeding.2,3 The introduction of potent P2Y12 inhibitors

further compounded the trade-off between ischaemic and bleeding
risks. Prasugrel and ticagrelor demonstrated superior ischaemic
protection compared with clopidogrel among patients with an
acute coronary syndromes (ACS) on background aspirin therapy.4,5
However, this benefit was counterbalanced by an increased bleeding risk consequent to the incremental platelet inhibition. Although
once considered benign events, in recent years, bleeding complications after PCI have been associated with a similar adverse prognosis as thrombotic events.6,7

Methods
Trial design and population
TWILIGHT was a randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted at 187
sites in 11 countries. The trial rationale, design, and principal results have
been reported previously.12,13 TWILIGHT was designed, coordinated,
and sponsored by The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.
AstraZeneca provided an investigator-initiated grant and supplied ticagrelor for the trial but had no role in the design, collection, analysis, or interpretation of the data. National regulatory agencies and institutional
review boards or ethics committees of participating sites approved the
trial protocol.
Patients undergoing successful PCI with a drug-eluting stent were eligible for study enrolment if they satisfied at least one clinical and one
angiographic criterion associated with a high risk of ischaemic or bleeding
events. Clinical criteria included age >_65 years, female sex, troponin positive ACS, atherosclerotic vascular disease [prior myocardial infarction
(MI), coronary revascularization or peripheral artery disease], diabetes
mellitus requiring medication, and chronic kidney disease (CKD).
Angiographic criteria included multivessel coronary artery disease, total
stent length >30 mm, thrombotic target lesion, bifurcation lesion requiring two stents, obstructive left main or proximal left anterior descending
lesion, and calcified target lesion requiring debulking devices. Key exclusion criteria included presentation with ST-elevation MI, cardiogenic
shock, prior stroke, or need for oral anticoagulation.
All enrolled patients received open-label ticagrelor (90 mg twice daily)
and enteric-coated aspirin (81-100 mg daily) after the index PCI. At
3 months, patients who had been adherent to treatment and without
major bleeding or ischaemic events were randomized 1:1 in a doubleblind fashion to aspirin or matching placebo for an additional 12 months
in addition to open-label ticagrelor. Follow-up occurred 1 month after
randomization via telephone and in-person at 6 and 12 months after
randomization.13

Endpoints
The primary endpoint was Bleeding Academic Research Consortium
(BARC) type 2, 3, or 5 bleeding up to 1 year after randomization. The key
secondary endpoint was the composite of all-cause death, MI, or stroke.
Moreover, we considered BARC 3 or 5 bleeding and the composite of
cardiovascular death, MI, or ischaemic stroke, as outcomes of interest for
this analysis in line with the recommendations of the ARC on HBR trial
design principles.15 Other secondary bleeding endpoints included
Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) major bleeding, Global Use
of Strategies to Open Occluded Arteries (GUSTO) moderate or severe

.. or bleeding, and International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis
..
.. (ISTH) major bleeding.16-19 Other secondary ischaemic endpoints
.. included all-cause death, cardiovascular death, non-fatal MI, ischaemic
..
.. stroke, and definite or probable stent thrombosis. MI was defined accord.. ing to the third universal definition, and stent thrombosis was classified
..
.. according to the ARC.20,21 All clinical events were adjudicated by an inde.. pendent committee, blinded to treatment assignment.
..
..
.. High bleeding risk assessment
..
.. Patients were considered as HBR if they fulfilled at least one major or
.. two minor criteria as defined by the ARC-HBR consensus statement.14
.. Major criteria available for analysis were severe or end-stage CKD [i.e.
..
.. estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 or dialy.. sis], haemoglobin <11 g/dL, moderate or severe thrombocytopenia (i.e.
..
.. platelet count <100  109/L), previous major bleeding, and liver disease.
.. Minor criteria included age >_75 years, moderate CKD (i.e. eGFR >_30 and
..
.. <60 mL/min/1.73 m2), haemoglobin >_11 and <13 g/dL for men and >_11
.. and <12 g/dL for women, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use.
..
.. Baseline laboratory values were obtained locally at each site during the
.. enrolment procedure. The eGFR was estimated according to the
.. Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equa..
.. tion.22 Supplementary material online, Table S1 summarizes the list of
.. available major and minor criteria and their definitions compared with
..
.. those provided in the original ARC-HBR document.14 Patients with miss.. ing data on at least one major or two minor criteria were excluded from
..
.. the analysis, unless they had other fulfilled criteria that identified them as
.. HBR.
..
..
.. Statistical analyses
..
.. In the primary prespecified analysis, the treatment effects of ticagrelor
.. monotherapy vs. ticagrelor plus aspirin were evaluated according to HBR
.. status.12 Clinical and procedural features are summarized by the presence
..
.. or absence of HBR and randomized group using means (standard devi.. ation) for continuous variables and frequencies for categorical variables.
..
.. The cumulative incidence of primary and secondary endpoints was esti.. mated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Patients without a primary end..
.. point between randomization and 1 year were censored at the time of
.. death, last known contact, or 365 days, whichever came first. Hazard
..
.. ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were generated using
.. Cox proportional hazards models, with formal interaction testing to as.. sess effect modification. Absolute risk differences (ARDs) and 95% CIs
..
.. for ischaemic and bleeding events were calculated with Kaplan-Meier
.. estimates and Greenwood standard errors. Interaction P-values on the
..
.. absolute scale were calculated with the Z-test to assess whether the dif.. ferences in ARDs between HBR and non-HBR patients were significantly
..
.. different than zero.
..
In addition, we performed an exploratory analysis to examine the
..
.. effects of ticagrelor monotherapy according to the number of ARC-HBR
.. criteria satisfied. Given that HBR was defined by the presence of (at least)
.. one major or two minor criteria, an ARC-HBR score was computed by
..
.. taking into account the relative weight of each major and minor HBR cri.. terion (i.e. 0.5 point assigned to each minor criterion and 1 point assigned
..
.. to each major criterion).23 Patients were then stratified into four groups:
.. (i) those without any criteria (0 point), (ii) with only one minor criterion
..
.. (0.5 point), (iii) with one major or two minor criteria (1 point), and (iv)
.. with multiple ARC-HBR criteria (>_1.5 points).23 For all analyses, bleeding
..
.. outcomes were assessed in the intention-to-treat cohort, while ischaemic
.. outcomes were analysed using the per-protocol cohort. A sensitivity ana.. lysis of bleeding outcomes was performed in the per-protocol cohort. A
..
. two-sided P-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. All

Contemporary advances in device technologies and pharmacological strategies have allowed extending PCI to older and more vulnerable cohorts.8,9 As such, an increasing number of patients
undergoing PCI have high bleeding risk (HBR) conditions, which
make a standard DAPT regimen clinically undesirable.10,11 The
TWILIGHT trial recently demonstrated that ticagrelor monotherapy
after a short course of DAPT is an effective and safe bleeding avoidance strategy among high-risk patients undergoing PCI.12 The trial
enrolled patients at high risk for both bleeding and thrombosis
according to a broad range of clinical and angiographic criteria.13 To
investigate the treatment effects of ticagrelor monotherapy compared with ticagrelor plus aspirin in a contemporary HBR population,
we conducted a prespecified analysis of the TWILIGHT trial using
the Academic Research Consortium (ARC) criteria for HBR.14

Results
Patient characteristics
A total of 9006 patients undergoing PCI were enrolled in the trial. Of
the 7119 patients randomized at 3 months post-PCI, 941 were
excluded for country-specific regulatory reasons (n = 587) or for
missing information on major or minor criteria required to ascertain
ARC-HBR status (n = 354). Hence, the final study cohort included
6178 patients, of whom 1064 (17.2%) were HBR (Supplementary
material online, Figure S1). Details regarding the reasons for enrolled
patients not undergoing randomization according to HBR status are
provided in Supplementary material online, Table S2. HBR patients
were older, more frequently female and of non-white race compared
with non-HBR patients. They had more cardiovascular risk factors
and comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes, and peripheral
artery disease, and were less frequently active smokers. Among HBR
patients, moderate CKD and age >_75 years were the two most common minor criteria (55.4% and 49.4%, respectively), while haemoglobin <11 g/dL was the most common major criterion (24.2%). With
respect to angiographic and procedural features, HBR patients were
less likely to have undergone PCI via radial access, and more often
had multivessel disease, left main PCI, and calcific lesions than nonHBR patients (Table 1). Baseline characteristics stratified by randomized treatment arm are provided in Supplementary material online,
Tables S3 and S4.
At 12 months after randomization, HBR patients were less adherent to the blinded study drug (74.5% vs. 83.7%, P < 0.001) and ticagrelor (79.2% vs. 87.7%, P < 0.001) than non-HBR patients, while there
were no significant differences between randomized treatment arms
within the two groups (Supplementary material online, Figure S2).
Reasons for non-adherence to study drug and ticagrelor are listed in
Supplementary material online, Tables S5 and S6, respectively.

Bleeding events
The primary endpoint of BARC 2, 3, or 5 bleeding occurred in 93
patients (8.9%) in the HBR group and in 237 patients (4.7%) in the
non-HBR group (HR 1.95, 95% CI 1.54-2.48; P < 0.001) (Supplementary material online, Figure S3A). There was a significant reduction in
the incidence of BARC 2, 3, or 5 bleeding in HBR patients randomized to ticagrelor plus placebo compared with those randomized to
ticagrelor plus aspirin (6.3% vs. 11.4%; HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.35-0.82;

..
.. P = 0.004) for an ARD of -5.1% (95% CI -8.5% to -1.7%). Treatment
.. effects on BARC 2, 3, or 5 bleeding were consistent among non-HBR
..
.. patients (3.5% vs. 5.9%; ARD -2.3%, 95% CI -3.5% to -1.2%; HR 0.59,
.. 95% CI 0.46-0.77; P < 0.001) with no evidence of heterogeneity
..
.. (Pinteraction = 0.673; difference in ARDs -2.8%, 95% CI -6.4% to 0.8%;
.. P = 0.130) (Figure 1A and Supplementary material online, Table S7).
..
..
The incidence of BARC 3 or 5 bleeding was significantly higher in
.. HBR than non-HBR patients (3.4% vs. 1.0%; HR 3.30, 95% CI 2.15-
..
.. 5.07; P < 0.001) (Supplementary material online, Figure S3B).
.. Ticagrelor plus placebo resulted in lower rates of BARC 3 or 5 bleed..
.. ing in both HBR (1.6% vs. 5.0%; HR 0.31, 95% CI 0.14-0.67, 0.003)
..
.. and non-HBR patients (0.8% vs. 1.3%; HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.36-1.09,
.. P = 0.098; Pinteraction = 0.148) (Figure 1B), but with an ARD significantly
..
.. larger in the former group (-3.5%, 95% CI -5.6% to -1.3% vs. -0.5%,
.. 95% CI -1.0% to 0.1%; difference in ARDs -3.0%, 95% CI -5.2% to
..
.. -0.8%; P = 0.008). A similar pattern was observed for other major
.. bleeding endpoints according to the TIMI, GUSTO and ISTH scale
..
.. (Figure 2 and Supplementary material online, Table S7). The sensitivity
.. analysis of bleeding outcomes in the per-protocol cohort was
..
.. consistent with the results of the intention-to-treat cohort
.. (Supplementary material online, Table S8).
..
..
.. Ischaemic events
..
.. A total of 66 (6.1%) key secondary endpoint events occurred in HBR
.. patients as compared with 181 (3.6%) in those without HBR (HR
..
.. 1.70, 95% CI 1.27-2.26; P < 0.001) (Supplementary material online,
.. Figure S4). Rates of all-cause death, MI, or stroke were not significantly

(5.5%) had more. There was a progressive increase in the risk of
BARC 2, 3, or 5 as a function of the number of ARC-HBR criteria satisfied, with the 1-year event rate increasing from 4.6% to 5.1%, 6.9%,
and 13.3% across the four groups. Similarly, the rate of BARC 3 or 5
bleeding increased from 0.8% to 1.6%, 2.1%, and 6.0%. A comparable
pattern was observed for ischaemic events (Supplementary material
online, Figure S5). The relative treatment effects of ticagrelor monotherapy on bleeding and ischaemic endpoints were consistent across
all HBR subgroups (Supplementary material online, Figures S6 and S7).

Discussion
The principal findings from this prespecified analysis of the
TWILIGHT trial are that: (i) HBR patients experienced higher rates
of not only bleeding but also ischaemic events than non-HBR
patients, with a risk proportional to the number of fulfilled ARC-HBR
criteria; (ii) ticagrelor monotherapy lowered the risk of clinically relevant BARC 2, 3, or 5 bleeding without increasing ischaemic events,
including death, MI or stroke, irrespective of HBR status; (iii) the absolute reduction in major bleeding complications associated with
ticagrelor monotherapy was more pronounced in HBR than nonHBR patients; (iv) the treatment effects on ischaemic and bleeding
events were consistent across different ARC-HBR risk categories.
Altogether, these findings highlight the role of 3-month DAPT followed by ticagrelor monotherapy as a safe and effective bleeding
avoidance strategy among HBR patients enriched with high ischaemic
risk features who undergo PCI with a drug-eluting stent (Graphical
abstract).
Percutaneous coronary intervention indications have extended to
increasingly complex patient populations over the last decade.24 As a
result, a large number of patients undergoing PCI present with clinical

periprocedural and late bleeding. As bleeding complications after PCI
are intrinsically related to the duration and intensity of antithrombotic therapy,25,26 short-term and single-drug antiplatelet regimens
seem sensible among HBR patients.27,28 However, use of these strategies is not straightforward because HBR patients have generally
been excluded or underrepresented in clinical research on DAPT
and they often are at increased risk of ischaemic events as well.10,11
While newer stent platforms have been tested among HBR patients
receiving an abbreviated DAPT regimen followed by aspirin monotherapy,29-31 most of these studies did not provide comparative data
on the benefits and risks associated with different DAPT durations
and, therefore, the optimal approach to HBR patients remains largely
unknown.
Recently, a strategy of early aspirin discontinuation followed by
P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy has been suggested as an alternative to
standard DAPT.32 The first large randomized study to test this novel
paradigm in antiplatelet therapy was GLOBAL LEADERS. In this trial,
23-month ticagrelor monotherapy after 1-month DAPT was not superior to 12-month DAPT in an all-comers population in whom
16.6% of patients were considered at HBR (as defined by a PRECISEDAPT score >_25).33,34 Conversely, in the TWILIGHT trial, which
preferentially enrolled patients at high risk for both bleeding and ischaemic events, ticagrelor monotherapy after 3-month DAPT, compared with ticagrelor plus aspirin, was shown to reduce bleeding
without compromising antithrombotic efficacy.12,13 The study clinical
and angiographic inclusion criteria, however, were relatively broad
and only partially overlapped with current definitions of high bleeding
and ischaemic risk. Patients with an indication for chronic oral anticoagulation, which is generally the most prevalent inclusion criterion in
HBR trials, prior stroke, planned surgery within 90 days, or other disorders at extreme risk for major bleeding were excluded. Dialysis,
platelet count <100  109/L, and liver disease were also trial exclusion criteria, but some patients with these conditions were enrolled

and thus were considered for the analysis. While the proportion of
ARC-defined HBR patients in the present study (17.2%) was lower
than what was reported in previous all-comer registries, it must be
noted that only patients deemed eligible for long-term DAPT with
ticagrelor could be enrolled in the trial. A large number of
TWILIGHT patients were indeed at high ischaemic risk with twothirds undergoing PCI for non-ST-elevation ACS, one-third having a
complex PCI procedure and 37% being diabetic.35-37 In this context,
ticagrelor monotherapy after 3-month DAPT represents an important bleeding avoidance strategy among HBR patients with concomitantly elevated ischaemic risk whom the treating physician intend to
discharge on a potent P2Y12 inhibitor. Furthermore, the distribution
of major and minor criteria, except for those excluded, was comparable with that of previous ARC-HBR validation studies, thereby supporting the external validity of our findings.10,11
Current European guidelines on non-ST-elevation ACS reserve a
strategy of ticagrelor monotherapy after 3-month DAPT for low-risk
patients, a recommendation justified by the lower than expected
rates of adverse events observed in TWILIGHT at 1 year.38 Against
this background, our results suggest that the treatment effects of ticagrelor monotherapy reported in the main trial are preserved in
higher risk cohorts who meet the ARC-HBR definition. Of note, the
incidence of the primary BARC 2, 3, or 5 bleeding endpoint was nearly doubled in HBR vs. non-HBR patients, while BARC 3 or 5 bleeding
was increased by more than three times. This gradient in risk was
even greater when considering the number of ARC-HBR criteria fulfilled. Owing to their risk profile, the absolute reduction in bleeding
risk realized with the experimental strategy was significantly larger in
HBR than non-HBR patients. This benefit was achieved despite
poorer adherence to study medications, partly due to the higher
event rates. Similar results have been reported in a subgroup analysis

of the STOPDAPT-2 trial looking at the effects of 1-month DAPT followed by clopidogrel monotherapy vs. 12-month DAPT among HBR
patients.39 However, that study was limited by very low bleeding
rates and included only Japanese patients-a group known to have
an ischaemic-bleeding risk profile different than non-East Asian
populations.40
Following the publication of the ARC-HBR consensus, a BARC 3
or 5 bleeding rate cut-off of 4% at 1 year post-PCI has been proposed
to identify actual HBR cohorts objectively.14 In TWILIGHT, the initial
3-month blanking period and the exclusion of patients ineligible to
12-month DAPT with ticagrelor (such as those on chronic oral anticoagulant therapy) may have led to a BARC 3 or 5 bleeding rate
slightly below this threshold. Nonetheless, ticagrelor monotherapy
reduced the incidence of BARC 3 or 5 bleeding in HBR patients from
5.0% to 1.6%. Importantly, the bleeding-related benefit of early aspirin
discontinuation seem to extend beyond the first year post-PCI, as
suggested by a recent head-to-head comparison between clopidogrel
and aspirin monotherapy for secondary cardiovascular prevention.41
Avoiding a trade-off in antithrombotic efficacy is the most challenging aspect of any bleeding reduction strategy involving short DAPT.
Although shortened exposure to DAPT may be particularly beneficial
in HBR patients, many such patients are also at increased risk for
thrombosis.42 In fact, in TWILIGHT, ischaemic event rates were
70% higher in presence of HBR-reflecting the fact that clinical
conditions such as diabetes, peripheral artery disease, and multivessel
disease were more common among these patients. Notwithstanding
this correlation, ticagrelor monotherapy, compared with ticagrelor
plus aspirin, did not increase the key secondary endpoint of death,
MI, or stroke, in either HBR or non-HBR patients. The net treatment
effects of ticagrelor monotherapy are consistent with pharmacodynamic observations of a marginal antiplatelet effect of aspirin when

added to potent P2Y12 inhibitors,43,44 although data specific to HBR
cohorts are lacking. Last, risk prediction models, such as the ARCHBR trade-off model, may help clinicians in tailoring antithrombotic
therapies based on the estimated ischaemic and bleeding risk of each
individual.42 Future studies should evaluate the utility of these new
risk assessment tools in personalized medicine to improve outcomes
of HBR patients.
Despite being a prespecified analysis from a large randomized,
placebo-controlled clinical trial, our study has important limitations
inherent to all subgroup analyses. HBR status was determined
according to the ARC-HBR definition, which has been validated previously.23 Nonetheless, the dichotomous nature of the ARC-HBR
definition limits its ability to accurately risk stratify across the spectrum of HBR patients. It is encouraging, however, that no signals of
heterogeneity in the relative treatment effects were seen when the
ARC-HBR score was applied. Not all ARC-HBR criteria were available for the analysis, and while some of those were not collected in
the study case report form, others were actually exclusion criteria
for the trial. Our findings do not apply to other P2Y12 inhibitors and
to patients who do not otherwise meet the study enrolment criteria
and who were not event-free and adherent to treatment at 3 months
after PCI. The present study was underpowered to detect clinically
relevant differences in ischaemic events, and the wide CIs do not rule
out a potential for harm of the experimental strategy among HBR
patients. Hence, our findings must be seen as hypothesis-generating
and warrant prospective confirmation in dedicated studies using the
ARC-HBR criteria.
In conclusion, among selected HBR patients who tolerated
3 months of DAPT with ticagrelor after PCI with a drug-eluting stent,
withdrawing aspirin and continuing ticagrelor monotherapy significantly decreased clinically relevant as well as major bleeding events
without compromising ischaemic protection, as compared with ticagrelor plus aspirin. As a bleeding avoidance strategy, ticagrelor monotherapy was associated with a larger absolute reduction in major
bleeding events among HBR vs. non-HBR patients.
