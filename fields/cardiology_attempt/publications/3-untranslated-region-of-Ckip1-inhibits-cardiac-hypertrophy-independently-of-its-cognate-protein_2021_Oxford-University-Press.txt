Aims

30 untranslated region (30 UTR) of mRNA is more conserved than other non-coding sequences in vertebrate
genomes, and its sequence space has substantially expanded during the evolution of higher organisms, which
substantiates their significance in biological regulation. However, the independent role of 30 UTR in cardiovascular
disease was largely unknown.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
Using bioinformatics, RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, we
and results
found that 30 UTR and coding sequence regions of Ckip-1 mRNA exhibited diverse expression and localization in

cardiomyocytes. We generated cardiac-specific Ckip-1 30 UTR overexpression mice under wild type and casein kinase 2 interacting protein-1 (CKIP-1) knockout background. Cardiac remodelling was assessed by histological, echocardiography, and molecular analyses at 4 weeks after transverse aortic constriction (TAC) surgery. The results
showed that cardiac Ckip-1 30 UTR significantly inhibited TAC-induced cardiac hypertrophy independent of CKIP-1
protein. To determine the mechanism of Ckip-1 30 UTR in cardiac hypertrophy, we performed transcriptome and
metabolomics analyses, RNA immunoprecipitation, biotin-based RNA pull-down, and reporter gene assays. We
found that Ckip-1 30 UTR promoted fatty acid metabolism through AMPK-PPARa-CPT1b axis, leading to its protection against pathological cardiac hypertrophy. Moreover, Ckip-1 30 UTR RNA therapy using adeno-associated
virus obviously alleviates cardiac hypertrophy and improves heart function.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusions
These findings disclose that Ckip-1 30 UTR inhibits cardiac hypertrophy independently of its cognate protein. Ckip-1
30 UTR is an effective RNA-based therapy tool for treating cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure.

Translational perspective
Cardiac remodelling is highly regulated both at the transcription and post-transcriptional processing. mRNA contains both the genetic
information translated from coding regions, but also untranslated regions (UTRs) at their 50 and 30 ends. In this study, we disclose
a totally novel function of Ckip-1 30 UTR, which substantially inhibits pressure overload-induced pathological cardiac hypertrophy independent of CKIP-1 protein. Overexpression of Ckip-1 30 UTR in cardiomyocytes substantially ameliorates metabolism reprogramming
through AMPK-PPARa-CPT1b axis and promotes heart function. The findings demonstrated that Ckip-1 30 UTR RNA would be a
potential effective RNA-based therapy tool for treating pathological cardiac hypertrophy.

Introduction
Pathological cardiac hypertrophy presents as the heart's response to
a variety of external and internal stresses, including mechanical or
neurohormonal stimuli, which eventually leads to heart failure
(HF).1-4 Cardiac hypertrophy is characterized by metabolic remodelling, Foetal gene reactivation, interstitial fibrosis, and contractile dysfunction.5-8 To improve clinical outcomes and avoid HF, new
therapies that target the precise regulatory mechanisms of cardiac
hypertrophy are needed.
RNA molecules, including protein-coding mRNAs and non-coding
RNAs, play critical roles in gene regulation. RNA metabolism is highly
regulated and plays important roles in cardiac development and disease.9-11 Various modification steps, including 50 -capping, intron
splicing, and 30 -polyadenylation, are required to generate mature
mRNAs. The structure of mRNA comprises a coding sequence
(CDS) region and 50 and 30 untranslated regions (UTRs).12,13 The
central hubs of post-transcriptional regulation are located in the
UTRs of mRNAs.14-16 Regulatory elements that determine the fate

of mRNAs, by regulating mRNA degradation, translation, and localization, are often located in the 30 UTR. 30 UTRs are highly conserved
in vertebrate genomes, highlighting their significant biological
roles.17,18 Furthermore, 30 UTRs are involved in the pathogenesis of
various genetic diseases.19 For example, an extended region of CTG
repeats in the 30 UTR of myotonic dystrophy protein kinase causes
cardiac conduction defects in humans.20 With such a protein-centric
view, 30 UTRs are typically defined by canonical transcription, showing that they are contiguous with the upstream coding regions in the
mRNA. Initially, CDS and 30 UTR of mRNA were thought to be oneto-one ratio correlates, but it was surprising to find widespread
unbalanced expression and different subcellular localization in mammals, plants, and bacteria.21,22 Genes with high 30 UTR/CDS ratios
are involved in neuron development.23 Moreover, a proteinindependent role of a 30 UTR has been discovered in Drosophila melanogaster; transfection with the Oskar 30 UTR rescues the eggless
phenotype of Oskar mRNA-null mutants, independently of the Oskar
protein.24 However, the independent roles of 30 UTR in cardiovascular disease are largely unknown.

Results
The 30 untranslated region and coding
sequence regions of Ckip-1 mRNA
exhibit diverse expression and
localization in heart
To systematically elucidate mRNA 30 UTR and CDS expression during HF, we examined publicly available deep RNA-sequencing (RNAseq) data that were generated from non-failing human heart (NF) and
non-ischaemic failing human heart (NICM).36 In comparison with the
NF samples, the discordant expression changes in the CDS and 30
UTR were observed in NICM samples (Supplementary material online, Figure S1A). Among the top 25 upregulated or downregulated
significantly changed mRNA 30 UTR or CDS from RNA-seq data

S2), CKIP-1, which had been demonstrated to respond to pathological
hypertrophy and promoted cardiac function in our previous studies,35 attracted our attention. Notably, the expression of the 30 UTR
and CDS regions of CKIP-1 mRNA in HF patient cardiac tissue was inconsistent. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRTPCR) analysis revealed that the level of the CKIP-1 mRNA 30 UTR
was significantly higher (four-fold) in HF samples compared with nonHF samples, while the level of the CKIP-1 mRNA CDS was significantly lower (0.5-fold) in HF samples compared with non-HF samples
(Figure 1C and D and Supplementary material online, Table S3).
In primary adult mouse cardiomyocytes, we next performed twocolour RNA in situ hybridization for Ckip-1 mRNA 30 UTR (green signal) and CDS (red signal) with Fam-labelled and Cy3-labelled RNA
probes, respectively (Figure 1E and Supplementary material online,
Figure S1B). Fam- and Cy3-labelled probes specific for 18S RNA were
used as cytoplasmic markers and positive controls. A non-specific
RNA probe was used as a negative control (Supplementary material
online, Figure S1C). The results showed that Ckip-1 mRNA 30 UTR
and CDS existed diverse cellular localization in the cardiomyocytes.
Simultaneously, we monitored copies change of Ckip-1 mRNA 30
UTR and CDS in isolated cardiomyocytes. Absolute copy number
analysis revealed that 30 UTR was present at 4000 copies per cell;
the CDS regions of Ckip-1 mRNA showed a lower abundance of
870 copies per cell (Figure 1F). Our findings suggest that the abundance of the cardiac Ckip-1 30 UTR was higher than that of Ckip-1
CDS and that the Ckip-1 30 UTR and CDS exhibited different spatial
distributions in cardiomyocytes.
We further analysed Ckip-1 mRNA 30 UTR and CDS transcript levels in cardiac hypertrophy induced by transverse aortic constriction
(TAC) in mice (Figure 1G and Supplementary material online, Figure
S1D). Remarkably, Ckip-1 CDS expression reached its peak level at
Day 7 in comparison with the sham control, whereas 30 UTR expression showed an initial increase 14 days after TAC, but it began to considerably decrease 21 days after TAC (Figure 1G). The results
demonstrated that 30 UTR and CDS regions of Ckip-1 mRNA exhibit
unequal expression change in response to HF.

Cardiac overexpression of Ckip-1 30
untranslated region blunts transverse
aortic constriction-induced cardiac
hypertrophy
To explore the role of Ckip-1 30 UTR in cardiac hypertrophy, we generated transgenic (TG) mice with overexpressing the Ckip-1 30 -UTR
in cardiomyocytes under control of the a-MHC promoter (Figure
2A). Two independent lines of TG mice (TG1 and TG2) were established. Compared to wild-type (WT) mice, Ckip-1 30 UTR mRNA levels of these two lines were increased four- to seven-fold
(Supplementary material online, Figure S2A and B). We selected TG-2
mouse line that exhibited specific higher expression levels of Ckip-1
30 UTR in heart tissues for subsequent experiments (Supplementary
material online, Figure S2C). Ckip-1 30 UTR TG mice and their agematched WT littermate controls were subjected to cardiac pressure
overload by TAC. After 4 weeks of TAC, we performed myocardial
histology analysis to evaluate cardiomegaly and fibrosis (Figure 2B and
C). We found a significant increase in cardiac fibrosis after TAC,
which was decreased in 30 UTR TG hearts compared with WT mice

A hallmark of energy metabolism in pathological hypertrophic
growth is the downregulation of fatty acid (FA) oxidation and a significant increase in glycolysis.25,26 With increasing severity of cardiac
hypertrophy, the pathological heart undergoes dramatic reprogramming that is linked to handling of excess FA that arise from adipose
tissue. This transition results in a cardiac metabolic signature that
embraces FA overload.27-29 The toxic intracellular accumulation of
lipid species contributes to HF.30,31 Understanding the metabolic
remodelling in the hypertrophic heart fuel is critical for developing
the concept of metabolic intervention in HF. AMP-activated protein
kinase (AMPK) is a crucial energy sensor and a master regulator of
cell metabolism that responds to a variety of stresses in the heart.32
AMPK activation efficiently inhibited cardiac hypertrophy.32,33 While
we understand the basic regulation of AMPK activity by kinases, recent studies had introduced the concept that AMPK was regulated by
non-coding RNA.34 However, the role of 30 UTRs in AMPK regulation is unclear.
In this study, we examined the alteration of mRNA 30 UTR and
CDS in the cardiac tissue of HF patients using publicly available highthroughput sequencing data. We found asymmetry in the expression
levels of 30 UTRs and their cognate CDS regions in HF patients; this
effect was particularly prominent for casein kinase 2 interacting
protein-1 (CKIP-1). Our previous study demonstrated that CKIP-1
protein was a novel regulator of cardiac remodelling via HDAC4/
MEF2C pathway.35 However, the physiological role of Ckip-1 30 UTR
in the heart is unknown.
Here, we identified Ckip-1 30 UTR as a novel regulator of pressure
overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy independently of CKIP-1 protein. Moreover, Ckip-1 30 UTR promoted FA metabolism through
AMPK-PPARa-CPT1b axis, which lead to protect against pathological cardiac hypertrophy. Notably, treatment with Ckip-1 30 UTR
sequences successfully alleviated cardiac hypertrophy and HF. Our
findings suggest that the Ckip-1 30 UTR performs a novel function in
cardiovascular disease independently of its cognate protein (Graphical
abstract).

Ckip-1 30 UTR inhibits cardiac hypertrophy

Ckip-1 30 untranslated region protects
against adverse cardiac remodelling in a
CKIP-1 protein-independent manner
To determine whether the role of Ckip-1 30 UTR in cardiac hypertrophy is independent of its cognate CKIP-1 protein, we generated a
Ckip-1 30 UTR TG mouse line with a Ckip-1 gene knockout (KO) genetic background (KO/30 UTR TG) (Figure 3A). Ckip-1 30 UTR was
highly expressed in KO/30 UTR TG, while no Ckip-1 30 CDS and
CKIP-1 proteins were detected (Supplementary material online,
Figure S4A-C). KO and KO/30 UTR TG littermates at 2 months of age
underwent TAC surgery for 4 weeks. Ckip-1 KO mice exhibited
marked cardiac hypertrophy, as revealed by size enlargements, large
areas of fibrosis, and increased heart weight/body weight (Figure
3B-D). In comparison with KO mice, KO/30 UTR TG mice exhibited

..
.. a decreased response to pressure overload-induced cardiac hyper.. trophy. The cardiomyocyte sizes and heart weight/body weight ratios
..
.. of KO/30 UTR TG mice were significantly decreased after TAC
.. (Figure 3C and D). Masson trichrome staining revealed less fibrosis in
..
.. the heart of KO/30 UTR TG mice compared with KO mice (Figure 3B
.. and Supplementary material online, Figure S4D). The expression lev..

.. UTR TG mice than in KO mice (Figure 3E-G).
..
Echocardiographic analysis showed significant decreases in EF and
..
.. FS in KO mice, but no changes in KO/30 UTR TG mice, after 4 weeks

.. of TAC (Figure 3H and I). In KO mice, 4 weeks of TAC caused
.. increases in LVIDs and LVIDd, and this response was markedly
..
.. reduced in KO/30 UTR TG mice (Figure 3J and K). There was similar
.. cardiac ventricle wall thickness in KO/30 UTR TG and KO mice
..
.. (Supplementary material online, Figure S4E-H). When compared

..
.. (Supplementary material online, Figure S5A), heart weight/body

..
.. (Supplementary material online, Figure S5C and D) demonstrated that
.. Ckip-1 KO was hypersensitive to pressure overload-induced cardiac
..
.. hypertrophy and Ckip-1 30 UTR TG mice under KO background
..

Collectively, these results indicated that Ckip-1 30 UTR reversed

(Figure 2B and Supplementary material online, Figure S2D). Staining
with wheat germ agglutinin revealed that the cross-sectional area was
significantly smaller in 30 UTR TG hearts compared with WT hearts
after TAC (Figure 2C). We found no significant difference between
the heart weight/body weight ratios of Ckip-1 30 UTR TG mice and
WT mice after TAC (Supplementary material online, Figure S2E). At
the molecular level, the TAC-induced expression of the hypertrophic
markers, atrial natriuretic peptide (Anp), brain natriuretic peptide
(Bnp), and myosin heavy chain 7 (Myh7), was significantly downregulated in 30 UTR TG mice (Figure 2D-F).
Echocardiography was performed to monitor cardiac structural
and functional changes. After TAC, WT mice represented impaired
contractile function. By contrast, ejection fraction (EF) and fractional
shortening (FS) after 28 days from sham or TAC surgery group were
significantly increased in 30 UTR TG mice compared with WT mice,
indicating the benefits of Ckip-1 30 UTR under basal and stress conditions (Figure 2G and H). This was accompanied in 30 UTR TG mice by
significantly decreased end-diastolic left ventricular internal diameter
(LVIDd) and end-systolic left ventricular internal diameter (LVIDs;
Figure 2I and J), and ventricular wall thickness was unchanged
(Supplementary material online, Figure S2F-I). In addition, western
blot analysis showed increased CKIP-1 protein levels in response to
30 UTR overexpression (Figure 2K). These data suggested that Ckip-1
30 UTR overexpression reduced the severity of cardiac hypertrophy
after TAC.
To investigate the role of Ckip-1 30 UTR in the regulation of physiological cardiac remodelling, we subjected Ckip-1 30 UTR TG and WT
mice to a 3-week swimming programme to induce physiological cardiac hypertrophy. The swimming exercise caused an increase in heart
weight/body weight without cardiac fibrosis in WT and Ckip-1 30
UTR TG mice (Supplementary material online, Figure S3A and B).
Echocardiography revealed that cardiac function increased significantly after the swimming programme in both WT and Ckip-1 30 UTR
TG mice and that this effect was stronger in Ckip-1 30 UTR TG mice
compared with WT mice (Supplementary material online, Figure S3C
and D). Cardiac structure data indicated that LVIDs was significantly
decreased in 30 UTR TG mice (Supplementary material online, Figure
S3E), LVIDd and ventricular wall thickness was unchanged compared
with WT mice (Supplementary material online, Figure S3F-J). These
data suggested that Ckip-1 30 UTR was also involved in the regulation
of compensatory physiological changes induced by swimming.

Ckip-1 30 untranslated region promotes
lipid metabolism and ATP synthesis
during cardiac hypertrophy
To investigate the regulation of Ckip-1 30 UTR on lipid metabolism
during cardiac hypertrophy, we performed liquid chromatography-
mass spectrometry- (Figure 5A-C) and gas chromatography-mass
spectrometry-based targeted metabolomics analysis (Figure 5D-E)
and metabolite quantification in the hearts of KO and KO/30 UTR TG
mice after TAC. Free FA levels were significantly lower in the cardiac
tissue of KO/30 UTR TG mice after TAC compared with KO mice
(Figure 5B and C), while TCA cycle intermediates were increased
from KO/30 UTR TG mice in response to TAC (Figure 5E).
Next, we measured adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels in KO
and KO/30 UTR TG mice after TAC surgery. ATP production
increased in KO/30 UTR TG mice but decreased in Ckip-1 KO mice,
after TAC (Figure 5F). Lipid accumulation was determined histologically by staining cardiac tissue sections with oil red O, which was
markedly increased in sections from the hearts of KO mice but not in
KO/30 UTR TG mice (Figure 5G and Supplementary material online,
Figure S7). Together, these data suggest that overexpression of Ckip-1
30 UTR inhibited lipid accumulation and facilitated the generation of
ATP through TCA cycle reactions from FA.

Ckip-1 30 untranslated region acts as Let7f sponge to facilitate the activation of
CaMKK2-AMPK-PPARa axis
30 UTRs often contain binding sites for regulatory miRNAs.
Therefore, we investigated potential miRNA-based mechanisms driving AMPK regulation by the Ckip-1 30 -UTR. Bioinformatics analysis
using TargetScan programme (Release 7.1) showed that both Ckip-1
30 UTR and calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase kinase 2 (Camkk2)
30 UTR contained Let-7f targeting sites (Figure 6A). Notably, Ckip-1 30
UTR overexpression increased the protein levels of CaMKK2 protein
(Figure 6B), which directly phosphorylates AMPK at Thr172.37 To

..
.. verify whether Let-7f was involved in the regulation of Ckip-1 30 UTR
.. on CaMKK2, we examined the relationship between CaMKK2 and
..
.. Let-7f. The results showed that knockdown of endogenous Let-7f
.. induced an increase in CaMKK2 protein level, and Let-7f overexpres..
.. sion significantly reduced the level of CaMKK2 (Figure 6C and
.. Supplementary material online, Figure S8A), but mRNA levels were
..
.. not affected (Supplementary material online, Figure S8B). Moreover,
.. the reporter gene activity of Camkk2 30 UTR was inhibited by Let-7f,
..
.. and mutation of Let-7f-binding sites in the Camkk2 30 UTR abolished
.. the inhibitory effect of Let-7f (Figure 6D). Furthermore, such an effect
..
.. had not existed in other putative binding sites at positions 1191-
.. 1196 (Supplementary material online, Figure S8C and D). These
..
.. results indicated that CaMKK2 protein level was regulated by Let-7f.
..
Next, we investigated whether Ckip-1 30 UTR sequence could
..
.. sponge Let-7f. Luciferase assay revealed that Let-7f could also sup.. press the luciferase activity of Ckip-1 30 UTR, but it had less effect on
..
.. the Let-7f-binding site mutation form of Ckip-1 30 UTR (Figure 6E). To

.. formed an RNA immunoprecipitation assay with anti-YFP antibody,
.. determining whether Let-7f could be pulled down by the YFP-MS2..
.. tagged Ckip-1 30 UTR. Let-7f was significantly enriched by the YFP

.. antibody (Figure 6F). Then, we applied inverse pull-down assay to test
..
.. whether Let-7f could enrich Ckip-1 30 UTR using biotin-labelled spe.. cific Let-7f probe. The results showed that Ckip-1 30 UTR but not its
..
.. mutant was co-precipitated (Figure 6G). These results revealed that
.. Ckip-1 30 UTR directly interacted with Let-7f.
..
More importantly, overexpression of Ckip-1 30 UTR but not Ckip-1
..
.. 30 UTR-mut increased CaMKK2 protein level, by which the phos..

.. Let-7f counteracted the regulation of Ckip-1 30 UTR on CaMKK2 and
..
.. the phosphorylation of AMPK (Figure 6H and Supplementary material

Next, we then evaluated whether Ckip-1 30 UTR regulated AMPK
activity. The results showed that Ckip-1 30 UTR TG mice resulted in a
large increase in T172-phosphorylated AMPKa compared with WT
mice, whereas the total AMPK protein remained unchanged (Figure
4E). Moreover, AMPKa was significantly activated in KO/30 UTR TG
mice compared with KO mice, independent of CKIP-1 protein (Figure
4F). AMPK activation increases PPARa expression and subsequently
induced its targets transcription, which involved in FA transport and
FA oxidation, including long-chain FA transport protein 1 (Slc27a1),
carnitine palmitoyltransferase1b (Cpt-1b), and acyl-coenzyme A oxidase 1 (Acox1). Their expression levels were further confirmed by
qRT-PCR (Figure 4G). Moreover, we investigated the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in mitochondria isolated from heart tissues of
Ckip-1 30 UTR TG mice (under the background of WT or KO mice)
(Supplementary material online, Figure S6D-G). The results demonstrated that cardiac-specific Ckip-1 30 UTR overexpression whether
in WT or Ckip-1 KO mice could significantly increase the OCR of cardiac mitochondria compared with their controls, respectively
(Supplementary material online, Figure S6D-G). Taken together, these
data implicated that Ckip-1 30 UTR regulated cardiac lipid metabolism
through the AMPK-PPARa axis in the heart.

Ckip-1 30 UTR inhibits cardiac hypertrophy

Discussion
In this study, we discovered a novel function of 30 UTR independent
of its cognate protein in the pressure overload-induced cardiac
hypertrophy. First, we found that 30 UTR and CDS regions of Ckip-1
mRNA existed diverse expression and localization in cardiomyocytes. Cardiac-specific Ckip-1 30 UTR overexpression in WT and
Ckip-1 KO mice protects from pressure overload-induced cardiac
hypertrophy and HF. Ckip-1 30 UTR functions as a novel regulator of
cardiac hypertrophy independent of CKIP-1 protein. Meanwhile, integrated analysis of transcriptomics and metabolomics data revealed
the important role of Ckip-1 30 UTR in the regulation of AMPK signalling and cardiac metabolism. Ckip-1 30 UTR significantly increased the
phosphorylation of AMPK at Thr172 by targeting Let-7f and

CaMKK2, activated the AMPK-PPARa-CPT1b axis, and promoted
the lipid metabolism and ATP production during pathological cardiac
hypertrophy. Importantly, Ckip-1 30 UTR therapy significantly alleviated pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Our results
showed that Ckip-1 30 UTR contained additional genetic information
that conferred a protective role during maladaptive cardiac stress
and metabolic remodelling, independently of CKIP-1 protein (Figure
7L).
30 UTRs are the non-coding regions of mRNA. The median length
of 30 UTRs is approximately 10-fold higher in humans compared with
yeast; however, the median length of CDSs is similar between the
two species. This suggests a critical role of 30 UTRs in higher organisms.38 The activation of pathological stress responses requires extensive reprogramming of the 30 UTR landscape. A growing number
of studies have found that 30 UTR-mediated processes are involved
in the pathogenesis of various diseases, including myotonic dystrophy,
b-thalassemia, thrombophilia, and cancer, as well as viral infections.39-42 Large-scale unbiased analyses revealed dynamic mRNA 30
UTR formation in the failing human heart.43 However, the role of 30
UTR in cardiac hypertrophy and HF was poorly understood. Our
findings highlight a novel regulatory model involving Ckip-1 30 UTR at
the transcriptional level. The Ckip-1 30 UTR restricts cardiac hypertrophy and improves heart function by regulating energy metabolism.
The central dogma of molecular biology implies that 30 UTRs are
typically contiguous with the upstream coding regions in the mRNA.
Intriguingly, widespread differential expression between coding region
and 30 UTR sequences has been detected in neurons and other tissues.21-23 30 UTR sequences have sophisticated functions, such as acting
as scaffolds and mediating protein-protein interactions.44 The length of
30 UTR length is regulated by alternative cleavage and polyadenylation.45 RNA-binding motif protein 10 is an anti-hypertrophy mediator
that regulates the procession of 30 UTR of key hypertrophy factors to
regulate cardiac hypertroph.46 A well-characterized model of a 30 UTR
that functions independently of its cognate CDS is the 30 UTR of the C.
elegans protein X-box binding protein 1 (xbp-1). The xbp-1 transcript
functions as part of a dual output xbp-1 mRNA stress response axis.47

response to TAC (Figure 7C and D). The heart weight/body weight
ratios after TAC were significantly lower in mice injected with AAV930 UTR compared with those injected with the AAV9 control (Figure
7C). Masson trichrome staining revealed less cardiac fibrosis in the
cardiac tissue of AAV9-30 UTR-injected mice after TAC compared
with control mice after TAC (Figure 7D and Supplementary material
online, Figure S9A). The reactivation of Foetal genes, Anp, Bnp, and
Myh7, was evidently reduced in the AAV9-30 UTR hearts in comparison with that in the AAV9-control hearts (Figure 7E-G).
Echocardiographic analysis showed significant decreases in EF and FS
in AAV9-control injected mice after 4 weeks of TAC, whereas the
changes in AAV9-30 UTR mice are not apparent (Figure 7H and I).
Notably, intramyocardial lipid accumulation was clearly decreased in
AAV9-30 UTR-injected mice after TAC surgery (Figure 7D and
Supplementary material online, Figure S9B). The expression of
CaMKK2 and the activation of AMPK were significantly higher in the
cardiac tissue of AAV9-30 -UTR-injected mice compared with AA9V
control mice after TAC (Figure 7J). Moreover, cellular ATP production was higher after TAC in mice injected with the AAV9-30 -UTR
compared with the AAV9 control (Figure 7K). These results demonstrated that Ckip-1 30 UTR sequence represented a potential RNAbased therapy for treating cardiac hypertrophy and HF.

Ckip-1 mRNA generates two distinct pathways that can allow cardiomyocytes to fine-tune their response to cardiac hypertrophy. This
work reveals a novel model of 30 UTRs-mediated regulation of cardiac hypertrophy and HF. Therefore, 30 UTR represents an attractive
RNA therapy tool for developing targeted therapeutic modalities for
the treatment of cardiovascular disease.

independent roles of 30 UTRs are largely unknown. In the present
study, we found that 30 UTR and CDS of Ckip-1 exhibited different expression and non-uniform distribution patterns in cardiomyocytes.
Notably, cardiac-specific Ckip-1 30 UTR overexpression protected from
pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy and metabolic remodelling independently of CKIP-1 protein. To our knowledge, this is the
first study to examine the role of 30 UTR in cardiovascular disease independent of its cognate protein in vivo.
Phosphorylation of the Thr172 site of AMPK markedly increases
its activity and is regulated by the liver kinase B1 or CaMKK2.37
Genetic KO of CaMKK2 in the cardiac tissues exacerbates ischaemic
injury through CaMKK2-AMPK-dependent pathway.49 AMPK activation also directly regulates transcription factor PPARa, which serves
an important role in the regulation of cardiac lipid and energy metabolism.50,51 In addition, PPARa promotes FA oxidation in cardiomyocytes via CPT1b, which is involved in the activation and transport of
FA into mitochondria.52
CKIP-1 was initially identified as a specific CK2a subunit-interacting
protein. CKIP-1 exhibits multiple biological functions in cardiovascular
disease, bone formation, tumorigenesis, and immune regulation by
interacting with various proteins.53 In our previous study, we found
that CKIP-1 conferred cardioprotective effects in various cardiac
remodelling phenotypes.35,54 The regulatory mechanism of CKIP-1
signalling pathway in the regulation of cardiac hypertrophy is dependent on the interaction of HDAC4 and PP2A.33 Here, we describe a
CKIP-1 protein-independent function of Ckip-1 30 UTR as an endogenous Let-7f sponge that increases myocardial CaMKK2 expression
after TAC stimulation. Subsequently, CaMKK2 induces AMPK activation and its downstream target PPARa. During hypertrophy, Ckip-1 30
UTR maintains mitochondrial oxidative energy metabolism by redirecting FA trafficking to mitochondrion via CPT-1b activation. Our
finding indicated that Ckip-1 30 UTR enhances the role of the
CaMKK2/AMPK/PPARa/CPT-1b pathway involved in cardiac energetics and mitigates cardiac lipotoxicity, thereby reversing the development of HF. Our findings demonstrated dual roles of Ckip-1 30 UTR
and CDS region regulation of cardiac hypertrophy and HF.
In summary, our findings enhance the current understanding of 30
UTRs and their role in regulating cardiac hypertrophy. The single
