See page 4321 for the editorial comment for this article 'LDL-cholesterol drives reversible myelomonocytic skewing in human bone marrow', by L. Yvan-Charvet and M. Westerterp, https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab630.

Aim

Preclinical work indicates that low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) not only drives atherosclerosis by
directing the innate immune response at plaque level but also augments proinflammatory monocyte production in
the bone marrow (BM) compartment. In this study, we aim to unravel the impact of LDL-C on monocyte production in the BM compartment in human subjects.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
A multivariable linear regression analysis in 12 304 individuals of the EPIC-Norfolk prospective population study
showed that LDL-C is associated with monocyte percentage (b = 0.131 [95% CI: 0.036-0.225]; P = 0.007), at the
and results

expense of granulocytes (b = -0.876 [95% CI: -1.046 to -0.705]; P < 0.001). Next, we investigated whether altered
haematopoiesis could explain this monocytic skewing by characterizing CD34th BM haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) of patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) and healthy normocholesterolaemic controls. The HSPC transcriptomic profile of untreated FH patients showed increased gene expression in pathways
involved in HSPC migration and, in agreement with our epidemiological findings, myelomonocytic skewing. Twelve
weeks of cholesterol-lowering treatment reverted the myelomonocytic skewing, but transcriptomic enrichment of
monocyte-associated inflammatory and migratory pathways persisted in HSPCs post-treatment. Lastly, we link
hypercholesterolaemia to perturbed lipid homeostasis in HSPCs, characterized by lipid droplet formation and transcriptomic changes compatible with increased intracellular cholesterol availability.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusions
Collectively, these data highlight that LDL-C impacts haematopoiesis, promoting both the number and the proinflammatory activation of circulating monocytes. Furthermore, this study reveals a potential contributory role of
HSPC transcriptomic reprogramming to residual inflammatory risk in FH patients despite cholesterol-lowering
therapy.

Introduction
Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of
death worldwide, despite improved preventive strategies and survival.1 Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is the key driver
of atherosclerotic CVD, making cholesterol-lowering treatment the
cornerstone of CVD prevention.2,3 Although a substantial proportion of cardiovascular (CV) events is prevented by cholesterollowering treatment, residual CV risk is considerable, even in patients
who reach very low plasma LDL-C levels.4 One of the contributors
to residual CV risk is inflammation, which is suggested to be partly
driven by enhanced monocyte activation.5 Targeting the proinflammatory monocyte response is therefore considered a potential strategy to reduce inflammatory risk with minimal systemic
immunosuppression.6-8
Mechanistically, atherosclerosis is the result of an unresolved inflammatory response of monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages to cholesterol retention in the arterial wall.9 Over the last
decade, it has become increasingly clear that hypercholesterolaemia
aggravates this inflammatory process by enhancing the production
of proinflammatory monocytes in the bone marrow (BM)

compartment.10,11 This is of clinical interest since epidemiological
studies have identified monocyte count as an important CV risk factor,12,13 whereas translational research has confirmed the association
of a proinflammatory monocyte phenotype with increased inflammatory activity in the arterial wall.14
In steady state, all types of mature blood cells-including
monocytes-are produced in the BM compartment via a process
called haematopoiesis. Following specific stimuli, multipotent
haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) undergo lineage commitment steps while proliferating and differentiating into
leukocytes, erythrocytes or thrombocytes.15 Animal studies have
shown that hypercholesterolaemia influences this process by promoting HSPC proliferation and myeloid commitment, ultimately
leading to monocytosis and accelerated atherosclerosis.16-18 Also,
alterations in lipid metabolism in HSPCs themselves following, for
example, activation of cholesterol synthesis19 or blocking of cholesterol efflux,20-22 enhances HSPC expansion and myeloid
skewing. Together, these studies substantiate that plasma cholesterol levels and intracellular cholesterol homeostasis have impact
on HSPC proliferation and differentiation.23 We therefore
hypothesized that the enhanced monocyte response in

LDL-C impacts hematopoiesis, promoting both the number and the proinflammatory activation of circulating monocytes.

Impact of cholesterol on proinflammatory monocyte production

Methods
Study population and design
Study population and design for mechanistic analyses in
hypercholesterolemic patients
For mechanistic validation, we conducted a single-centre observational
study between July 2017 and May 2019 at the Amsterdam UMC (location
AMC), The Netherlands. We included untreated FH patients who had an
indication to start lipid-lowering therapy [statin, proprotein convertase
subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), and/or ezetimibe] according to their
treating physician. FH was defined as having a mutation in one of the
known FH-causing genes (LDLR, PCSK9, APOB) or, in the absence of such
mutation after genetic testing, having a Dutch Lipid Clinic Network score
>_ 6 (=probable or definite FH).24 Exclusion criteria included active smoking, established CVD and recent use (<3 months) of cholesterol-lowering
drugs. The healthy controls were age, sex, and body mass index (BMI)
matched with the FH patients. After inclusion, FH patients underwent
blood withdrawal and a sternal bone marrow aspiration at baseline and
after 12 weeks of lipid-lowering therapy. The healthy controls underwent
these procedures once. All participants provided written informed consent. The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the
Amsterdam UMC and was conducted according to the principles of the
Declaration of Helsinki.

Study population and design for epidemiological analysis
in the EPIC-Norfolk cohort
For the assessment of the correlation between LDL-C, apolipoprotein B
(ApoB) and leucocyte count and differential, we used data from the
European Prospective Investigation into Cancer in Norfolk (EPICNorfolk) study.25 Between 1993 and 1997, 25 639 subjects were
recruited from general practices and included in this study. The study
protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the Norwich District
Health Authority and all study participants gave written informed consent
prior to enrolment.

Bone marrow experiments
All the laboratory experiments and bioinformatics analyses regarding
HSPC characterization are available in detail in the Supplementary material online.

Statistical approach
Statistical analysis of the EPIC-Norfolk data
After excluding subjects with C-reactive protein (CRP) >_10 g/L [to minimize bias caused by (acute) infections] and missing leucocyte count and

..
.. Quantification and statistical analyses FH study
.. All data were analysed using R version 3.6.3 (R Core Team, Vienna,

hypercholesterolemic patients5 could be traced back to LDL-Cmediated disruption of cholesterol homeostasis in HSPCs and
subsequent altered haematopoiesis.
To examine our hypothesis, we performed two human studies. First, we conducted a mechanistic study in which we performed ex vivo unbiased RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and
functional analyses of CD34th BM HSPCs (hereafter HSPCs) of
patients with untreated familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) before and after cholesterol-lowering treatment, and compared
these results to normocholesterolemic healthy control subjects.
Next, we used epidemiological data to determine the relationship between LDL-C and leucocyte count and differential in the
EPIC-Norfolk study.

Cholesterol-lowering treatment
mitigates decreased HSPC
differentiation and myelomonocytic
skewing in the BM compartment
Following the first BM aspiration, FH patients received maximally tolerated cholesterol-lowering treatment by either a statin, a PCSK9
antibody or a combination, with or without ezetimibe (Supplementary material online, Table S2). After 12 weeks of treatment, a mean
66% reduction in plasma LDL-C levels was achieved (P < 0.001),
resulting in a mean post-treatment plasma LDL-C level of
1.89 +/- 1.16 mmol/L (Supplementary material online, Table S2). No
significant changes in leucocyte (-0.02 [1.25]; P = 0.961) and monocyte count (0.12 [1.48]; P = 0.803) were observed.
After 12 weeks of treatment, HSPC gene expression demonstrated a trend towards normalization of the transcriptomic profile
(Figure 2A). Pairwise comparison of the transcriptomic profile before
vs. after treatment showed 2462 significantly DEGs, of which 940
genes were upregulated and 1522 genes were downregulated after
treatment (Figure 2B). GO term analysis of the significantly downregulated genes showed predominantly enrichment of pathways
involved in cell motility (Figure 2C). In addition, GO term analysis of
the significantly upregulated genes and GSEA showed predominantly
enrichment of pathways implicated in OXPHOS (Figure 2D-F). To
functionally validate these findings, we measured the oxygen

..
.. consumption rate in HSPCs by Seahorse Flux Analysis. As expected
.. and while not significant, basal respiration was almost 70% lower
..
.. (P = 0.067) in untreated FH patients vs. healthy controls, and was sig.. nificantly increased after cholesterol-lowering therapy (P = 0.029)
..
.. (Figure 2G), following the OXPHOS gene expression pattern seen in
.. the RNAseq.
..
Since OXPHOS fluxes are higher in more proliferative and differ..

..
.. proliferation and HSPC differentiation were concomitantly increased
.. after cholesterol-lowering therapy. Indeed, GSEA confirmed enrich..

.. in FH patients after treatment (FDR = 0.000 and FDR <0.001, re..
.. spectively) (Figure 2H and I). Earlier we noted that the attenuation of
.. genes involved in granulocyte differentiation was most prominent in
..
.. untreated FH patients compared to healthy controls. Interestingly,
.. both GO term analysis and GSEA revealed reversibility of this effect,
..
.. showing significantly increased gene expression associated with neu.. trophil activation (Figure 2D) and granulocyte differentiation (Figure
..
.. 2J), respectively. Alleviation of decreased gene expression in path.. ways involved in HSPC differentiation was further supported by sig..
.. nificant enrichment of gene sets involved in lymphopoiesis,
..
.. erythropoiesis, and megakaryopoiesis, whereas the gene set involved
.. in monocytopoiesis was unaffected (FDR = 0.994) (Supplementary

suggests that fatty acids are the preferred substrates for oxidation in
HSPCs of untreated FH patients32 (Figure 1E).
GO term analysis of the significantly downregulated genes in untreated FH patients demonstrated enrichment of the pathways 'myeloid leucocyte activation' and 'antibacterial humoral response' (Figure
1F). In accordance with our epidemiological data showing a negative
association of LDL-C with granulocyte percentage, these two pathways predominantly consisted of downregulated granulocytic associated genes (15 out of 16 genes), which was also reflected by a downregulation of the gene set 'transcriptional regulation of granulopoiesis' in untreated FH patients (FDR = 0.000) (Figure 1G). In addition to
these monocytic-skewed transcriptomic changes in HSPCs of untreated FH patients, an up-regulation of KITLG, encoding an important
regulator of stem cell survival and myelopoiesis called stem cell factor
(SCF)33 was observed, in addition to down-regulation of lymphoidassociated gene IL734 (Figure 1H).
HSPCs give rise to mature blood cells through cell proliferation
and differentiation.35 Interestingly, GSEA showed that gene sets
related to cell cycle and differentiation were negatively enriched in
untreated FH patients (FDR = 0.000 for both) (Figure 1I-J).
Metabolically, this was in line with a concordant negative enrichment
of the oxidized phosphorylation (OXPHOS) gene set (FDR = 0.000)
(Figure 1K), which is a metabolic programme used in more proliferating and mitochondrial active HSPCs.36,37 The decreased gene
expression associated with HSPC differentiation, in addition to the
up-regulation of stem cell survival regulator KITLG, coincided with a
1.4-fold increase of the percentage CD34th HSPCs in the BM compartment (P = 0.004) (Figure 1L), measured by flow cytometry. Taken
together, the HSPC transcriptome of untreated FH patients differs
from healthy controls, hallmarked by global up-regulation of promigratory pathways and myelomonocytic skewing.

inflammatory response' pathway and GSEA revealed enrichment of
the gene set 'regulation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) mediated signalling pathway' (FDR = 0.019) (Figure 3C and D). This is in line with our
previous findings showing that the trained immunity phenotype of circulating monocytes of FH patients is hallmarked by persistent
enhanced cytokine production after LPS stimulation ex vivo.5 Among
the most upregulated inflammatory genes were plaque macrophage
marker CD163 (Klco et al., 2011)40 and PLA2G7, which encodes
lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) (Figure 3E). LpPLA2 is an enzyme produced by plaque macrophages, serves as a
marker for vulnerable plaques and is a strong predictor of CVD.41,42
Also, genes involved in chemotaxis were persistently elevated in
HSPCs of treated FH patients, including CCL2, CXCL12, and VCAM1
(Figure 3E), with concomitant enrichment of the gene set 'monocyte

chemotaxis' (Figure 3F). This gene expression profile coincided with
persistent decreased cell surface expression of BM homing receptor
CXCR4 on CD34th HSPCs (Figure 3G and Supplementary material
online, Figure S2), and sustained increased CCR2 cell surface expression on both BM (Figure 3H and Supplementary material online, Figure
S2) and circulating CD14th monocytes (Figure 3I) after treatment.
Analysis of the monocyte subset distribution in the BM compartment
did not show any significant differences (Figure 3J). Also, we did not
find significant correlations between CCR2 expression on circulating
monocytes and CCR2 expression on bone marrow monocytes, nor
with CXCR4 expression on CD34th HSPCs (Supplementary material
online, Figure S3). Altogether, these results indicate that transcriptomic reprogramming of HSPCs could contribute to the trained immunity phenotype found in circulating monocytes of FH patients.

Both hypercholesterolaemia and
cholesterol-lowering treatment affect
lipid homeostasis in HSPCs of FH
patients
Disrupted lipid homeostasis in HSPCs has major impact on
HSPC behaviour. 10,23 Moreover, preclinical studies have linked
altered lipid metabolism in myeloid progenitors to trained immunity.18,43 Indeed, the top 25 of most significantly overexpressed gene sets in untreated FH patients compared to
healthy controls included gene sets 'cholesterol storage', 'lipid
metabolism', and 'lipid digestion mobilization and transport'
(FDR = 0.007, 0.005, and 0.038, respectively) (Figure 4A-C). In
parallel, staining of intracellular lipid droplets (LDs) by Nile Red
demonstrated an increased number of LDs in HSPCs of untreated FH patients compared to healthy controls (Figure 4D
and E). Cells form LDs in reaction to lipid overload to prevent
lipotoxicity.44 In line with GSEA, also other compensatory
pathways to lower intracellular cholesterol content were
observed in HSPCs of untreated FH patients, including significant up-regulation of cholesterol efflux transporter gene expression of ABCA1 and ABCG1 (Figure 4F). In turn, cholesterollowering treatment led to normalization of intracellular LD
number (Figure 4D and E). This coincided with a significant reduction of ABCA1 and ABCG1 (Figure 4F). Lastly, PPARD and
PPARG, encoding lipid sensors peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor delta and gamma, respectively, were significantly upregulated before treatment (Figure 4G). After
cholesterol-lowering treatment, PPARD expression decreased,
whereas PPARG remained significantly upregulated (Figure 4G).
This persistent up-regulation of PPARG post-treatment corresponded with enrichment of the gene set 'lipid metabolism' in
treated FH patient vs. healthy controls (Figure 4H).

LDL-C is epidemiologically and
mechanistically linked to enhanced
monocyte production
Our findings in the EPIC-Norfolk cohort revealed no association of
LDL-C with leucocyte count and opposing associations with monocyte
and granulocyte percentage, independently of CRP levels. These results
suggest that the association of LDL-C with specifically monocyte count
is not merely a reflection of the low-grade inflammatory state hallmarking patients with increased CV risk, but could imply an LDL-C-specific
biological effect on leucocyte subset formation. These findings were validated mechanistically, where we showed that the HSPC transcriptomic
profile was characterized by myelomonocytic skewing in untreated FH
patients. Notably, we demonstrated that the myelomonocytic skewed
transcriptomic profile largely normalized after cholesterol-lowering
treatment, including up-regulation of master regulator and promotor of
granulopoiesis CEPBA.38 Our results are in line with previous preclinical
findings demonstrating that hypercholesterolaemia-induced myeloid
skewing was in part the result of transcriptional reprogramming of the
bipotential GMPs.18 Combined, our epidemiological and mechanistic
results support that LDL-C promotes monocyte production in the BM
compartment at least in part via modulated GMP fate, thereby impeding
granulocytic differentiation. Of note, in the absence of a lymphoid
skewed transcriptomic pattern in BM HSPCs of untreated FH patients,
the significant positive association between LDL-C and lymphocyte
number in the EPIC-Norfolk study may imply a positive effect of hypercholesterolaemia on extramedullary lymphopoiesis.

LDL-C promotes promigratory phenotype
of monocytes and their progenitors
Besides increased monocyte number, also the promigratory phenotype
of monocytes and their progenitors contribute to accelerated atherosclerosis. In this respect, we observed an up-regulation of promigratory
genes in HSPCs of untreated FH patients, including FLT1. This is of interest, since blocking of Flt1 in a hypercholesterolemic mouse model,
abrogated myeloid progenitor egress from the BM compartment into
the circulation, which coincided with decreased macrophage content in
atherosclerotic lesions.27 Furthermore, we observed decreased cell
surface expression of the BM homing receptor CXCR4 on HSPCs of
untreated FH patients of which its down-regulation has been described
to promote HSPC mobilization.45 Indeed, previous human studies have
linked hypercholesterolaemia to HSPC migration, evidenced by an association between total cholesterol levels and circulating CD34th
HSPCs.46,47 In line, we previously showed that circulating monocytes of
FH patients have increased CCR2 cell surface expression,5,48 facilitating
monocyte migration into the atherosclerotic plaque.49 Interestingly, we

..
.. here show that CD14th monocytes in the BM compartment of FH
.. patients also have persistent increased CCR2 cell surface expression
..
.. after cholesterol-lowering treatment. The persistent CCR2 expression
.. on both BM as circulating monocytes and concomitant persistent
..
.. promigratory HSPC transcriptomic profile in treated FH patients
.. implies hypercholesterolaemia-induced HSPC priming in vivo.
..
..
..
.. Disrupted lipid homeostasis linked to
..
.. altered HSPC behaviour
.. Preclinical work has established that hypercholesterolaemia directly
..
.. impacts HSPCs and their behaviour.10 Here, we observed that
.. increased plasma LDL-C levels lead to a profound increase in LD
..
.. number in HSPCs of untreated FH patients, despite compensatory
.. up-regulation of cholesterol efflux transporter genes ABCA1 and
..
.. ABCG1. Interestingly, in parallel of the increased LD number in
.. HSPCs, we found at both transcriptional as functional level decreased
..
.. mitochondrial OXPHOS in HSPCs of untreated FH patients and
.. increased PDK4 expression, marking fatty acid oxidation. Inhibition of
..
.. OXPHOS has been described in the setting of excess intracellular
.. lipid accumulation50 and could have driven the observed differenti..
.. ation impairment of HSPCs in untreated FH patients.51
.. Corroborating these findings, normalization of plasma LDL-C levels
..
.. following cholesterol-lowering treatment coincided with reduced LD
.. number in HSPCs, in addition to an increase in OXPHOS and allevi..
.. ation of the reduced differentiation. However, the reduction in
..
.. OXPHOS could also be a passive reflection of the observed
.. increased percentage of upstream HS(P)Cs in untreated FH patients.
..
.. Future studies on whether these aforementioned metabolic changes
.. drive monocytic biased differentiation of HSPCs, and via which mech..
.. anisms the different cholesterol-lowering treatment modalities im.. pact these changes, are therefore warranted.
..
..
..
.. Clinical implications
.. Lessons from the CANTOS trial that targeting inflammation along..
.. side cholesterol-lowering therapy is able to further reduce CVD
.. risk,52 has fuelled the search for other anti-inflammatory therapies to
..
.. combat (residual) inflammatory CVD risk. Our study suggests that
.. even after cholesterol-lowering treatment modulated haematopoi..
.. esis contributes to the pro-atherogenic monocyte response in hyper..
.. cholesterolemic patients, highlighting that BM HSPCs could serve as a
.. new therapeutic target. For example, targeting mobilization of mono..
.. cytes and their precursors has already been suggested to mitigate
.. accelerated atherosclerosis post-myocardial infarction, whereas our
..
.. findings emphasize a potentially beneficial effect in the chronic inflam.. matory setting as well.27,53 However, targeting HSPCs is probably
..
.. more complex, since several preclinical studies have established that
.. the changes in HSPCs contributing to prolonged monocyte activation
..
.. are multifaceted, with metabolic, transcriptomic, and epigenetic alter.. ations.18,43,54 Especially in the context of trained immunity, further re..
.. search in hypercholesterolemic patients is warranted, to further
.. investigate whether the observed transcriptomic (and metabolic)
..
.. HSPC reprogramming is accompanied by epigenetic alterations in

that HSPCs of untreated FH patients are hallmarked by myelomonocytic skewing and a promigratory phenotype, coinciding with perturbed intracellular lipid homeostasis. Twelve weeks of cholesterollowering treatment largely reverted these HSPC alterations.
However, despite normalization of plasma LDL-C levels, gene

In conclusion, this study provides epidemiological and mechanistic
evidence that hypercholesterolaemia modulates HSPC behaviour in
the BM compartment, thereby enhancing proinflammatory monocyte
production in patients. Moreover, persistent promigratory and proinflammatory gene expression in HSPCs despite normalization of
plasma LDL-C levels suggests that prolonged monocyte activation
originates in the BM compartment of hypercholesterolemic patients.
