Aims

Aortic aneurysm and dissection (AAD) are high-risk cardiovascular diseases with no effective cure. Macrophages
play an important role in the development of AAD. As succinate triggers inflammatory changes in macrophages,
we investigated the significance of succinate in the pathogenesis of AAD and its clinical relevance.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
We used untargeted metabolomics and mass spectrometry to determine plasma succinate concentrations in 40
and 1665 individuals of the discovery and validation cohorts, respectively. Three different murine AAD models
and results

were used to determine the role of succinate in AAD development. We further examined the role of oxoglutarate
dehydrogenase (OGDH) and its transcription factor cyclic adenosine monophosphate-responsive element-binding
protein 1 (CREB) in the context of macrophage-mediated inflammation and established p38aMKOApoe-/- mice.
Succinate was the most upregulated metabolite in the discovery cohort; this was confirmed in the validation cohort. Plasma succinate concentrations were higher in patients with AAD compared with those in healthy controls,
patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and patients with pulmonary embolism (PE). Moreover, succinate
administration aggravated angiotensin II-induced AAD and vascular inflammation in mice. In contrast, knockdown of
OGDH reduced the expression of inflammatory factors in macrophages. The conditional deletion of p38a
decreased CREB phosphorylation, OGDH expression, and succinate concentrations. Conditional deletion of p38a
in macrophages reduced angiotensin II-induced AAD.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
Plasma succinate concentrations allow to distinguish patients with AAD from both healthy controls and patients
with AMI or PE. Succinate concentrations are regulated by the p38a-CREB-OGDH axis in macrophages.

Translational perspective
Plasma succinate concentration in patients with aortic diseases including aortic dissection and aortic aneurysm is high. This parameter
may be used as a pre-hospital diagnostic auxiliary index to distinguish aortic diseases from healthy controls, acute myocardial infarction
and pulmonary embolism. Increased plasma succinate leads to dysfunction of mitochondria and increased reactive oxygen species levels
in vasculature, thereby aggravating aortic aneurysm and dissection (AAD). We observed that inhibition of the p38a-cyclic adenosine
monophosphate-responsive element-binding protein 1-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase axis in macrophages reduced their release of succinate, inhibiting the progression of AAD. Therefore, inhibiting succinate-related pathways such as reducing the plasma succinate content or inhibiting succinate-induced mitochondrial dysfunction may be used as potential therapeutic targets for AAD.

Introduction
Aortic aneurysm and dissection (AAD) have a prevalence of 1.3-8%
and are associated with high mortality due to acute aortic complications.1-3 Sporadic AAD are associated with smoking, hypertension,
old age, and male gender. The pathogenesis of AAD is associated
with inflammation, apoptosis, smooth muscle cell phenotype switch,
and degradation of the extracellular matrix.4,5 There are no effective
drugs to prevent the occurrence and development of AAD.6
Therefore, it is essential to explore potential therapeutic targets for
AAD.
Succinate plays critical roles in a variety of physiological and
pathophysiological conditions. It accumulates in the myocardium
during myocardial ischaemia and is rapidly oxidized to generate
reactive oxygen species (ROS) with the occurrence of

reperfusion, which led to the death of myocardial cells and
aggravated ischaemia-reperfusion injury.7 Dimethyl malonate, by
inhibiting succinate dehydrogenase, improved ischaemia-reperfusion injury during myocardial infarction in mice and pigs.7,8
Succinate also plays an important role in maintaining glucose
homeostasis. For example, succinate contributes to intestinal
gluconeogenesis and accelerates adipose tissue thermogenesis.9,10 Succinate released from muscles during exercise contributes to the formation of extracellular matrix and muscle
regeneration.11 Furthermore, succinate plays an important role
in the pathophysiological process of diseases such as diabetes,
chronic neuroinflammation, osteoclastogenesis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and intestinal type 2 immunity.12-18 However, the contribution of succinate to AAD and its
clinical relevance remain unclear.

Methods
Additional details about the methods are available in the Supplementary
material online. The corresponding author can be contacted for access to
experimental data associated with this study.

Study population
The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Tongji
Hospital (Tongji Medical College, Wuhan, China) and was conducted in
accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the International
Conference on Harmonization Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice.
Informed consent was obtained from all participants. The study was a
two-stage (the discovery stage and the replication stage) case-control
study and a total of 1705 participants were included. Patients with aortic
diseases, including aortic dissection (AD) and abdominal aortic aneurysm
(AAA), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), or pulmonary embolism (PE),
were recruited from Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College in Wuhan,
China, between January 2014 and September 2020. Blood samples were
collected before emergency surgery and mostly are the first day of admission. Because of limitation of PE cases, all patients with PE were included
in our cohort. Healthy control subjects who had no significant systemic
diseases (e.g. ischaemic heart disease, cancer, pulmonary disease, or infectious diseases) were recruited from the communities of Wuhan and
Tongji Hospital. All blood samples were collected and plasma was separated by centrifugation immediately and stored at -80 C until analysis.

Statistical analyses
Data were analysed using R (version 3.6.3; R Foundation, Vienna,
Austria) and GraphPad Prism version 8.0 (GraphPad Software, San
Diego, CA, USA). Continuous variables with normal distribution are
expressed as the mean +/- standard deviation (SD). Continuous variables that did not pass the normality test are expressed as the median with interquartile range (IQR). Categorical variables are
expressed as numbers and percentages (%). Comparisons between
groups were performed using the Student's t-test or Wilcoxon test
for quantitative variables and the Fisher's exact test or the
Chi-squared test for categorical variables.

..
In the validation set, data were available for 1665 individuals,

Macrophages are known to display a diverse array of metabolic
characteristics that depend upon their functional states.19 In M1
inflammatory macrophages, glycolysis is enhanced, whereas the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle is interrupted at several key points,
thereby leading to the accumulation of TCA intermediate products. Succinate is an important intermediate product of the TCA
cycle that accumulates in M1 pro-inflammatory macrophages.20
Succinate transported from mitochondria to the cytoplasm inhibits
proline hydroxylase activity, increases the levels of hypoxiainducible factor 1-alpha, and induces the expression of interleukin
(IL)-1b. In addition, succinate in mitochondria generates a large
amount of ROS through oxidation by succinate dehydrogenase,
promoting M1 polarization.21
In our current study, we found that plasma succinate concentrations were positively correlated with human aortic diseases and succinate plays an important role in the pathogenesis of AAD as
demonstrated in three well-established murine AAD models.

Succinate aggravates AAD formation in
mice
To determine the role of succinate in AAD, we administered succinate or vehicle control to mice and constructed BAPN/angiotensin II
(Ang II)-induced AAD model (Supplementary material online, Figure

..
.. S5A). Succinate administration increased the mortality rate (41.7% vs.
.. 71.4%, Figure 2A and B), AAD incidence (67% vs. 100%, Figure 2C),
..
.. and also appeared to increase the diameter of ascending aorta, aortic
.. arch and descending aorta at 31 days, but with only three animals
..
.. remaining in the succinate group, statistical significance is not
.. reported. Compared with the vehicle control group, succinate ad..
.. ministration increased aortic pathology as showed by haematoxylin
.. and eosin (H&E) staining and Elastic Van Gieson (EVG) staining
..
.. (Supplementary material online, Figure S5B). Succinate administration
.. increased the level of ROS in the vasculature (Supplementary
..
.. material online, Figure S5C and D).
..
In a second AAD model, we administered succinate or vehicle
..
.. control to Apoe/ mice and then infused Ang II for 28 days
..
.. (Supplementary material online, Figure S6A and B). Succinate adminis.. tration elevated AAD incidence from 60% in Ang II-infused control
..
.. animals to 100% in Ang II-infused succinate-supplemented mice of
.. AAD (Figure 2E and F). Succinate-administered mice exhibited a sig..
.. nificant increase in the maximal aortic diameter compared with con.. trol mice (ascending aorta: 1.33 +/- 0.18 vs. 1.67 +/- 0.29 mm, P = 0.0301;
..
.. aortic arch: 1.34 +/- 0.11 vs. 1.65 +/- 0.25 mm, P = 0.0138; abdominal:
.. 1.66 +/- 0.84 vs. 1.06 +/- 0.38 mm, P = 0.0490; Figure 2G). Similar changes
..
.. were observed in mice infused with Ang II for 14 days
.. (Supplementary material online, Figure S7). H&E staining revealed
..
.. that aortic medial thickness increased significantly, whereas EVG
..
.. staining showed that elastic tissue fibers had increased fragmentation
.. in succinate-treated animals (Supplementary material online, Figure
..
.. S6C). Moreover, immunohistochemistry revealed that the levels of
.. pro-inflammatory factors such as IL-1b, matrix metalloproteinase-9
..
.. (MMP9), IL-6, and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-a were increased in
.. the aortic tissues of succinate-administered mice (Supplementary ma..

.. ROS in succinate-administered Apoe/ mice after Ang II-infused for
..
.. 3 days (Supplementary material online, Figure S6F and G). Notably, we
.. further confirmed that succinate supplementation aggravated BAPN..
.. induced AAD (Figure 2H). We found that the incidence of AAD

.. increased in mice receiving water containing 1.5% succinate (Figure

To determine the utility of plasma succinate concentrations as a
potential biomarker for all aortic diseases, the predictive ability of
succinate was evaluated by using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) that gave a value of 0.83 (95% CI:
0.81-0.85, P = 0.006, Supplementary material online, Figure S3B) with
better discriminative performance than baseline module (AUROC =
0.79, 95% CI: 0.76-0.81, reference), which included age, sex, smoking,
drinking, history of hypertension, and diabetes, and systolic blood
pressure. Furthermore, the combined AUROC of these two factors
was statistically higher (AUROC = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.86-0.89,
P < 0.0001).
In addition, the decision curve analysis (DCA) is a novel method
used to evaluate alternative diagnostic strategies that has advantages
over the AUROC method. The DCA curves obtained for baseline,
succinate, and baseline plus succinate conditions are presented in
Figure 1D. Compared with the baseline condition, succinate alone
modestly elevated the net benefit; however, the combination showed
significantly higher net benefits, indicating that plasma succinate test
has a potential clinical application value.
Aortic diseases, AMI, and PE are potentially fatal conditions that
share similar symptoms but require different treatment strategies.
Therefore, it is vital for clinicians to distinguish these three diseases.
Thus, we enrolled 199 patients with AMI and 76 patients with PE to
find whether any biochemical parameters could reliably distinguish
aortic diseases from AMI and PE (Supplementary material online,
Table S4). Plasma succinate concentrations were increased significantly in patients with aortic diseases compared with those in patients
with AMI (median: 12.0 lmol/L, IQR: 8.23-16.85, P < 2.22  10-16)
and PE (median: 15.45 lmol/L, IQR: 11.22-26.8, P < 2.22  10-16)
(Figure 1E). The AUROC values for patients with AMI and PE vs.
healthy controls were 0.63 (0.59-0.67) and 0.53 (0.46-0.60), respectively (Figure 1F). The AUROC values in patients with aortic disease
vs. patients with AMI and PE were 0.91 (0.88-0.93) and 0.80 (0.73-
0.86), respectively (Figure 1G). Therefore, plasma succinate concentrations had a positive diagnostic performance and allowed differentiation of patients with aortic disease from healthy controls and
patients with AMI and PE.
Beta-blocker therapy is routine in AAD and could suppress
mitochondrial metabolism, potentially leading to the accumulation of
succinate. We then assessed cross-sectional relationships between
blood succinate levels and presence of AD, stratified by those who
had vs. had not received beta-blocker therapy (Supplementary
material online, Table S5). While blood succinate levels were noted
to be elevated in subjects having AD, there was no difference among
those who had vs. had not received beta-blocker therapy (all patients,
P = 0.27, Type A AD, P = 0.49, Type B AD, P = 0.37, Supplementary
material online, Figure S4).

We then focused on the transcriptional regulation of Ogdh
expression in macrophages. According to the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-seq database (http://rna.sysu.edu.cn/chipbase3/)23,
transcription factor cyclic adenosine monophosphate-responsive
element-binding protein 1 (CREB) could bind to the promoter region
of Ogdh (Figure 4A). In the dual-luciferase reporter assay performed
to validate these in silico data, overexpression of CREB resulted in the
activation of the Ogdh promoter compared with the results obtained
with vector-control (Figure 4B). CREB bound to the promoter region
of Ogdh in BMDMs according to the ChIP assay (Figure 4C and D). To
prove that CREB regulates OGDH expression in macrophages, we
knocked down the Creb1 gene using siRNA, which decreased
OGDH and pro-IL-1b expression levels in LPS-treated BMDMs
(Figure 4E). Similar results were obtained in BMDMs incubated with
the selective CREB inhibitor 666-15 (Supplementary material online,
Figure S11A).
We also found that the levels of phosphorylated CREB (p-CREB)
in macrophages were increased significantly in AAD (Figure 4F and
Supplementary material online, Figure S11B-E). Furthermore, expression levels of CREB and OGDH showed remarkable positive correlation in three independent public aortic disease databases
(Supplementary material online, Figure S11F-H).

Phosphorylation of CREB by p38a
increases succinate production and
promotes inflammatory reactions of
macrophages
CREB is a widely expressed transcription factor whose activity is
regulated by a variety of kinases. Previous research reported that,
under LPS stimulation, CREB has been shown to be phosphorylated
by p38a24 and we reproduced those observations (Supplementary
material online, Figure S12). We further investigated the role of p38a
in the regulation of succinate production. First, p38a myeloid-deleted
mice (p38aMKO mice) were obtained by crossing p38a-flox mice
(p38afl/fl mice) with LysM-Cre mice (Figure 5A). In LPS-stimulated
BMDMs from p38aMKO mice, the levels of phosphorylated CREB
were lower than in LPS-treated BMDMs from p38afl/fl animals. These
results support the notion that p38a phosphorylates CREB after LPS
stimulation (Figure 5A). Immunoprecipitation experiments showed
that p38a binds to CREB (Figure 5B). p38a knockout downregulated

..
.. OGDH at both the mRNA and protein levels (Figure 5C and D) and
.. decreased the content of succinate in BMDMs (Figure 5E). We also
..
.. found that the expression of pro-IL-1b in p38aMKO BMDMs was
.. lower than in p38afl/fl BMDMs (Figure 5F). p38a deletion impacted ex..
.. pression of other inflammatory factors in BMDMs stimulated by LPS:
.. we detected decreases in the expression levels of genes encoding
..
.. macrophage pro-inflammatory factors, such as Nos2, Hif1a, Il1b, and
.. Ccl2 (Figure 5G). The proportion of M1 pro-inflammatory (CD86
..
.. positive) macrophages (Figure 5H) and the level of intracellular ROS
.. (Figure 5I) were lower in p38aMKO BMDMs than in p38afl/fl BMDMs.
..
.. In addition, we constructed a different p38a-deficient macrophage
..
.. cell line by using CRISPR-Cas9 technology (Supplementary material
.. online, Figure S13A and B). Overall, p38a deletion in RAW264.7 cells
..
.. reduced their inflammatory potential (Supplementary material online,
.. Figure S13C-I).
..
..
.. p38a deletion in macrophages attenuates
..
.. the formation of AAD
..
.. We found that p38a expression was significantly increased in human
.. AAD tissues (Supplementary material online, Figure S14A-D).
..
.. Furthermore, we confirmed that p38a was specifically enriched in
.. macrophages (Figure 6A and Supplementary material online, Figure
..
.. S14E-H). Therefore, we explored the role of p38a in the progres.. sion of AAD. We treated wild-type mice with the specific p38a in..
.. hibitor SB203580 (Supplementary material online, Figure S15A). This
.. compound inhibited the progression of AAA induced by elastase
..
.. (Figure 6B and Supplementary material online, Figure S15B-D). Next,
..
.. we crossed p38aMKO and p38afl/fl mice with Apoe-/ mice to obtain
.. p38aMKO Apoe-/ and p38afl/fl Apoe-/ mice. The incidence of AAD
..
.. decreased in p38aMKO ApoE/ mice infused with Ang II (Figure 6C
.. and D), and their aortic diameters were smaller than in their wild..
.. type littermates (Figure 6E). H&E staining revealed that the wall thick.. ness and the loss of smooth muscle cells were less pronounced in
..
.. p38aMKO Apoe-/ mice than in their wild-type littermates (Figure 6F).
.. EVG staining revealed that the knockout of p38a in macrophages
..
.. prevented the degradation of elastin (Figure 6G).
..
Macrophage infiltration in AAD, especially that of M1 pro..
.. inflammatory macrophages (F4/80th/CD206-), was lower in
..
.. p38aMKO Apoe-/ mice (Figure 6H), indicating weaker aortic inflam.. mation. A similar phenomenon was also observed in mice infused
..
.. with Ang II for either 3 or 7 days (Supplementary material online,
.. Figure S16). Moreover, immunohistochemistry data showed reduced
..
.. aortic expression levels of inflammatory factors such as MMP9, IL-6,
.. monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 MCP1, TNF-a, and IL-1b in
..
.. p38aMKO Apoe-/ mice compared with those in p38afl/fl Apoe-/ mice
.. (Figure 6I). Our findings were also supported by the observations in
..
.. other AAA models: deletion of p38a in macrophages attenuated
..
.. AAA induced by elastase (Supplementary material online, Figure S17).
..
To definitely prove that the relief of AAA induced by p38 knock..
.. out was due to the decrease of succinate levels, we examined the ef.. fect of succinate supplementation in p38 knockout mice. In p38aMKO
..
.. BMDMs, concentrations of pro-IL-1b and IL-1b in the supernatant
.. increased significantly after pre-treatment with 5 mM succinate
..
.. (Supplementary material online, Figure S18A and B). In our further

. 1.5% succinate (Supplementary material online, Figure S18C), which

significantly after LPS stimulation, which promoted succinate accumulation.22 Here, we found that OGDH was increased significantly in
macrophages within AAD tissue sections, suggesting that OGDH
might play an important role in AAD (Figure 3B and Supplementary
material online, Figure S10). Importantly, knockdown of the Ogdh
gene via siRNA attenuated inflammation in bone marrow-derived
macrophages (BMDMs) stimulated with LPS for 24 h, reducing the
expression of Il1b and Nos2 at the mRNA level (Figure 3C and D), as
well as of OGDH and pro-IL-1b at the protein level (Figure 3E). The
concentration of succinate decreased significantly after Ogdh knockdown (Figure 3F). Moreover, the addition of succinyl phosphonate, a
specific inhibitor of OGDH, downregulated the expression of Il1b
and Nos2 at the mRNA level and the content of pro-IL-1b at the protein level (Figure 3G-I).

significantly increased AAD incidence rate and maximal aortic diameter (Supplementary material online, Figure S18D-F) compared with
those in mice that received normal water. In addition, wall thickness
and levels of pro-inflammatory factors increased and elastin integrity
decreased in succinate-supplemented mice (Supplementary material

administration of succinate aggravated elastase-induced AAA
(Supplementary material online, Figure S19).

found that plasma succinate concentrations were increased in
patients with aortic diseases (AD and AAA) using untargeted
metabolomics and targeted mass spectrometry. Furthermore,
plasma succinate concentrations can be used as a biomarker for
pre-hospital AAD diagnosis and allow reliable differentiation from
AMI and PE when patients present with chest pain. We also found
that succinate administration increased the mitochondrial ROS
level in the vasculature, further aggravated Ang II-, BAPN- and
BAPN/Ang II-induced AAD. We discovered that the p38a-CREB-
OGDH axis regulates the production of succinate in macrophages.
Deletion of p38a could inhibit the progression of AAD (Graphical
abstract). Therefore, plasma succinate can be used both as a biomarker for AAD diagnosis and a potential target for AAD
therapeutics.

.. occur in diseased states where hypoxia-inducible factor-1a was pre.. viously found to be involved AAD development.27 This suggests that
..
.. a relatively hypoxic region is present in the AAD aortic wall which is
.. likely to be associated with succinate accumulation.28 Therefore, the
..
.. release of aortic sources of succinate from AAD would be expected
.. to occur.
..
..
In addition to the host, the gut microbiota is an important source
.. of succinate.29 Increased abundance of succinate-producing microbes
..
.. is positively correlated with elevated plasma succinate concentration
.. and an increased risk of obesity.12 However, in our study, it cannot
..
.. be ruled out whether elevated succinate plasma levels in patients
..
.. with AAD are related to the altered composition of their gut micro.. biota or destruction of the integrity of intestinal barrier. Hence, fur..
.. ther experiments are needed to determine the major source of
.. succinate in patients with AAD.
..
In searching for the potential mechanisms by which succinate pro..
.. motes AAD, we turned to oxidative stress as it has been implicated
..
.. in the development of AAD. It is known that succinate can be taken
.. up directly by cells to exert its biological functions, such as promoting
..
.. intestinal gluconeogenesis and adipose thermogenesis.9,10 Indeed, in
.. our study, administration of succinate increased ROS level in AAD
..
.. tissues. These results support the notion that increased plasma suc.. cinate levels in patients with AAD lead to the increased uptake of
..
.. extracellular succinate by macrophages or smooth muscle cells. The
..
.. succinate is then oxidized by succinate dehydrogenase to produce a
.. large amount of ROS that aggravates AAD. Thus, it is conceivable
..
.. that dimethyl malonate, a competitive inhibitor of succinate dehydro.. genase, can be used to reduce the generation of ROS and alleviate
..
.. AAD.
..
SUCNR1, the receptor of succinate, is widely expressed in a var..
.. iety of cells of the immune system, nervous system, heart, and muscle.
.. Whether the expression or function of SUCNR1 is altered during
..
.. the pathophysiology of AAD is also unknown. The EC50 of succinate
.. required for the activation of SUCNR1 is 17-56 lM.30 Our study
..
.. determined plasma succinate concentrations to be a median of
..
.. 15.3 lM in healthy individuals. However, its level can be as up to
.. 35.2 lM in patients with AAD. These high plasma succinate concen..
.. trations can be expected to cause SUCNR1 activation and signal
.. transduction in macrophages and smooth muscle cells. In our future
..
.. study, we will focus on verifying whether the succinate-SUCNR1
.. axis is involved in the progression of AAD. Using succinate..
.. neutralizing antibodies to maintain normal plasma succinate concen.. tration may be another possible way to inhibit AAD progression.31
..
..
In summary, our findings reveal that succinate plays an important
.. role in the pathogenesis of AAD and can potentially be used as a new
..
.. biomarker for diagnosis. In mice, inhibiting the p38a-CREB-OGDH
..
.. axis in macrophages is sufficient to mitigate AAD. These data provide
.. a rationale for targeting succinate-related pathways as a new target
..
.. for AAD treatment.

upregulated metabolite in the plasma of patients with AAD when
compared with healthy controls. Importantly, as shown in Figure 1E-
G, succinate plasma level may not only serve as an independent circulating marker for AAD, but can also be utilized as an auxiliary indicator for pre-hospital diagnosis to differentiate patients with AAD from
patients with AMI and PE who present similar symptoms. We recognize that computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging
remains the preferred imaging modalities for AAD diagnosis and
monitoring; however, they are less applicable for mass screening and
large-scale trials. While current succinate measurement by mass
spectrometry as performed in our study may limit its practical utility
in clinic, a point-of-care testing can potentially be developed for
plasma succinate detection in the future for emergency usage. Of
note, beta-blocker therapy did not increase the concentration of succinate in the current study. Given the size of this data set, there still
remains a possibility that acute administration of beta-blockers or
other therapeutics makes a partial contribution to the increase in circulating succinate concentration at the time of surgical repair. This
will deserve future confirmation studies using larger patient cohorts
of AAD.
Our study also highlights a previously unknown causal role of high
plasma succinate in driving AAD and may be exploited as a target for
therapy development against AAD. Accumulating studies have implicated a pathological role for succinate in the development of a variety
of diseases such as AMI, autoimmune diseases, diabetes, and chronic
neuroinflammation. In light of our findings, we postulated that high
plasma succinate concentration in patients with AAD plays a promotional role in the development of AAD. As unequivocally demonstrated in three AAD murine models (Ang II, BAPN, and BAPN/Ang
II), succinate administration to mice markedly aggravated the AAD
phenotype. Thus, we believe that plasma succinate levels can not
only be used as a biomarker to discriminate AAD from healthy control and patients with AMI and PE but also be utilized as a potential
target for AAD treatment.
The cellular source of succinate has become increasingly clear.
Previous studies have reported that succinate accumulated in inflammatory macrophages and can be released to the extracellular milieu,
such as in rheumatoid arthritis, chronic neuroinflammation, and systemic lupus erythematosus, further accelerates the progression of
diseases.13,15,17 According to the above studies, inflammatory cells,
especially macrophages, accumulate in AAD tissues and may release
succinate into the blood during AAD, causing an increase in plasma
succinate level, which in turn, aggravates the progression of AAD.
With that in mind, we focused our attention on macrophages to determine the requisite importance of succinate and the mechanistic
basis of succinate regulation, in the promotion of AAD. To address
this, we hypothesized that disruption of key pathways of succinate
production in macrophages could inhibit AAD development. The activity of OGDH increases in inflammatory macrophages.22 In line
with our hypothesis, we found that knockdown of the OGDH gene
can significantly inhibit the accumulation of succinate and secretion of
inflammatory factors in inflammatory macrophages (Figure 3C-E).
The expression of OGDH in patients with AAD also increased significantly. These results suggest that OGDH is a potential therapy target
for AAD.
In addition to inflammatory cells, succinate accumulates in ischaemic tissues such as heart and brain.7 Aortic hypoxic injury may also
