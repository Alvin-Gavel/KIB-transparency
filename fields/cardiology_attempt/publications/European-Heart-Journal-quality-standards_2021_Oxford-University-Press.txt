Introduction

Authorship criteria
According to the ICMJE guidelines,4 authorship should be based on
the following four criteria: (i) substantial contributions to conception
or design of the work, or the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of
data for the work; (ii) drafting of the work or revising it critically for
important intellectual content; (iii) final approval of the version to be
published; and (iv) agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the

work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of
any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved. As
noted in the ICMJE guidelines, 'This final criterion helps Editors solve
potential issues that may arise during or after the publication of the
work'. All those designated as authors should meet all four criteria
for authorship. Those who do not meet all four criteria but contributed to the study should be acknowledged after obtaining permission.
One author should be identified to take responsibility for the integrity of the work as a whole.4,7-12 Authors should certify the validity of
the work and also that the manuscript has not been previously published or is considered for publication in another journal4,7-12 (Figure
2).
The EHJ will accept requests to recognize joint authorship (e.g.
joint first or senior authors) as it is known that modern science
requires advanced, multidisciplinary teams to address many questions
of interest. Generally, it is expected that these joint roles will be
shared by two authors.4 In the instances where a small subset of
authors is largely responsible for leading the manuscript, and there is
a larger body of investigators that provided supplemental support for
the manuscript, a paper written on behalf of a named pool of investigators identified by a study team in the authorship line should be considered.4 Detailing individual contributions in the manuscript is the
best way to give the required credit to each author.

Conflicts of interests
The EHJ is fully committed to transparency and this includes disclosure of potential conflicts of interest13-17 (Figure 2). The proposed

will further judge on the scientific impact and clinical influence of the study. The editorial decision-making process includes relative priority as compared with competing papers, alignment with the scope of the journal, and readers' interest. Only the best papers will be published in the European
Heart Journal.

The aim of the European Heart Journal (EHJ) is to attract innovative,
methodologically sound, and clinically relevant research manuscripts
able to change clinical practice and/or substantially advance knowledge on cardiovascular diseases.1-3 As the reference journal in cardiovascular medicine, the EHJ is committed to publish only the best
cardiovascular science adhering to the highest ethical principles.1-6
EHJ uses highly rigorous peer-review, critical statistical review, and
the highest quality editorial process, to ensure the novelty, accuracy,
quality, and relevance of all accepted manuscripts with the aim of
inspiring the clinical practice of EHJ readers and reducing the global
burden of cardiovascular diseases1-6 (Figure 1).
The EHJ subscribes to the recommendations of the International
Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) for the conduct,
reporting, editing, and publication of scholarly work in biomedical
journals.4 The EHJ is a registered member of the Committee on
Publication Ethics (COPE) and endorses this code of conduct on ethical issues in research and publication.5,6

Figure 2 The quality standards of the European Heart Journal are based on the widely respected and accepted international editorial recommendations. These include authorship criteria, conflict of interest, trial registration, data sharing initiatives, and sound statistical analyses, among others.
Scientific integrity is paramount to ensure the credibility and clinical influence of the research findings. COPE, Committee On Publications Ethics;

new ICMJE disclosure form suggests using the term 'relationships and
activities' rather than the classic 'conflicts of interest' to ensure a
more balanced interpretation by readers.4 However, both terms may
be used for disclosure. The rationale for disclosure is to preserve
trust in the scientific process and the credibility of published material.13-17 Financial and non-financial relationships and activities pertinent to the submitted work that may be perceived by the reader as
potential conflicts of interest should be disclosed. It is important to
recognize that bias may exist when professional judgement on a primary interest may be influenced by a secondary interest (e.g. economic gain). When in doubt it is better to err on the disclosure side.
Readers' perceptions of competing interests (independent of the
authors' opinion) may erode trust in the scientific process. These
relationships and activities may be 'directly' related or 'topically'
related to the submitted work. Financial issues relate to payments to
authors or their institutions.4 The time frame for those relationships
or activities directly related to the submitted work is from initial conception of the work to present. For those topically related, the time
frame to be considered is from 36 months ago to the present.4 The
ICMJE recently updated the form and included the possibility of
accepting disclosures from well-selected web-based repositories.17
The EHJ requires that all authors complete the standardized electronic ICMJE 'Disclosure Form' and a conflict of interest statement to
be included under the 'Disclosures' heading in the submitted
manuscript.
In addition, all sources of support for the work should be separately disclosed in detail. The role of the funding source (sponsor) in the
design, analysis, interpretation, and writing of the manuscript should

be clarified. Any potential restriction to publication agreed upon with
the sponsor should be detailed. The corresponding author should
declare 'I had full access to all the data and I take complete responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the analysis'. For
multicentre or international studies, a 'guarantor' of the entire study
should be identified.4

Trial registration
The process of best practices for clinical trials led by the World
Health Organization (WHO) includes universal prospective registration, public disclosure of results from clinical trials, and data sharing.18-21 The EHJ promotes transparency of the research process
with systematic online publication of the protocols of clinical trials
and also large prospective observational studies, registries, surveys,
and meta-analyses (Figure 2). The Cochrane collaboration provides
an excellent tool in this regard. Meta-analyses should be pre-registered in specific repositories (e.g. PROSPERO).22
Clinical trials should be 'registered' in a public trial's registry as a
condition for publication.4,18-21 A 'clinical trial' is defined as any research project that prospectively assigns people to an intervention
(with or without concurrent comparison or control group) to study
the relationship between a health-related intervention and a health
outcome. Interventions are modifiers of biomedical or health-related
outcomes, including procedures, devices, dietary or behavioural
treatments, educational programmes, quality improvement, and process-of-care changes.4

Pre-prints
Pre-prints (author's original version) are permitted and the EHJ
accepts manuscripts previously posted on a not-for-profit preprint
server following some conditions as detailed in the Instructions
to Authors (https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/pages/General_In
structions#5.6). Authors of original research and review articles,
excluding ESC Guidelines, retain the right to make a pre-print available through various channels. Should a work have been published in
a pre-print server, this should be disclosed to the editors.

Data sharing
Data sharing facilitates independent validation of study results, fosters
new hypotheses, and allows new analyses of the data. This not only
promotes further advancements in scientific knowledge but also
remains an ethical obligation to participants in a trial. Data sharing
aims to maximize knowledge gained from published studies and
increases confidence and trust in clinical trials.23-25 Data sharing does
have important limitations. The EHJ recognizes that there may be
data use agreements, regional laws, and ethical considerations that
will limit the availability of some data sets, particularly large electronic

health record studies and studies involving advanced imaging and rare
diseases. Thus, the EHJ requirement for a data sharing plan is to document the plan-whether data are made publicly available is a separate construct (Figure 2).
The data sharing plan should be explicitly disclosed in the manuscript.23-25 Data sharing statements must indicate whether individual
de-identified participant data will be shared (link to data repository),
what data in particular will be shared (data dictionaries and codes),
and when and under what specific circumstances or terms (types of
analyses permitted) will be shared. Authors of secondary analysis
should always seek collaboration of primary authors, clearly acknowledge the data source, and give substantial credit to initial investigators. Many secure online repositories for research data allow the
archive of any type of file assigning a unique digital object identifier
(DOI). An open data repository would offer obvious advantages for
authors, institutions, funders, and journals, including greater transparency and enhanced feasibility of patient-level meta-analyses. Data
sharing is a major endeavour that will affect how clinical trials are
planned and conducted. This is an opportunity to define criteria for
data collection and sharing that will make outcome events comparable and potentially combined among trials. However, unresolved
issues remain in this editorial initiative, including appropriate scholarly
credit to those sharing the data, resources needed to implement data
access, transparent processing of data requests, and tools for data
archiving.23-25 Therefore, the EHJ considers that, at this time, the
requisite mechanisms to 'mandate' universal data sharing are not yet
in place. Where ethically feasible, the journal strongly encourages
authors to make all data and software code on which the conclusions
of the paper rely available to readers. A clear data availability statement must be included in the text of the manuscript and requires
that all publicly available datasets are fully referenced in the reference
list with an accession number or unique identifier such as a DOI.

General guidelines for authors
As a result of the EHJ commitment to research integrity, formal review, and approval (or waiver) by the corresponding institutional review boards or ethic review committees is required for all original
research article.4 In addition, all studies should follow the principles
outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. Finally, all human participants
should provide written informed consent.4 Oral informed consent
alone will be accepted in rare occasions and the reason to justify oral
consent should be clarified. Authors of studies including a waiver of
informed consent (nationwide registries, massive data sources, biobank results, etc.) should justify this decision in detail with the editor.
Research conducted as 'not human subjects research' by means of
use of certified de-identified healthcare data should detail how the
determination of approval was obtained and the certifications for the
data's de-identification whenever possible.
Before submission, the EHJ instructions to authors (https://academ
ic.oup.com/eurheartj/pages/General_Instructions) should be carefully
reviewed for technical details. In addition, the authors at the time of
submission will be asked to complete a general check-list confirming
adherence to the quality standards of the EHJ. This check-list is
reported in Table 1.

Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/28/2729/6325300 by Stanford Libraries user on 28 April 2022

The registries for prospective registration should be managed by a
not-for-profit organization, be open, publicly accessible at no charge,
electronically searchable, and ensure validity of the registration data.
Prospective clinical trial registration should be performed in any
registry of the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform
that includes the minimum acceptable 24-item trial registration dataset.4 ClinicalTrials.gov (https://www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the EU
Clinical Trials registry (https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu) fulfill all
these criteria. The entire 24-item dataset should be completed.
Trial registration prevents selective publication and duplication of
research and ensures consistency in methods and predefined outcome measures (primary and secondary endpoints).18-21 Trial registration should include a detailed description of the statistical plan,
particularly the primary and secondary endpoint definitions and any
pre-specified subgroups that will be considered. Potential discrepancies between data on the registry and final publication (protocol
amendments, etc.) should be avoided and, if present, should be
explained and justified in detail to the Editors. The registration numbers, name of the register, and date of registration in these public
repositories should be provided. Registration is required to occur before the time of the first patient enrolment. When the final paper is
published, registration should be eventually updated to include the
journal citation.18-21
Prospective registration is required for all clinical trials but the EHJ
strongly recommends preregistration of other studies as meta-analysis and observational studies. Registration number should be
included at the end of the abstract and corresponding methods section. The clinical trial protocol, including the complete statistical analysis plan, should be submitted to the journal as online supplementary
material. Publication of study designs is important to ensure credibility in the scientific process, yet these contributions rarely achieve the
priority needed for publication in the EHJ.

EQUATOR provides an excellent source of general guidelines for
authors detailing specific recommendations for the different types of
studies.26 The EHJ requires that authors complete check-lists for
reports of certain specific studies. Overenthusiastic reporting of new
findings to the scientific community should be tempered. These
guidelines help to provide a clear vision of how the work was made.
Causal language is only permitted for randomized clinical trials; for
the remaining types of studies, methods, results, and discussion
should be described in terms of 'associations' and 'correlations' but
should avoid cause-effect implications.
i. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) should be presented following the
CONSORT recommendations.27-29 The CONSORT flow-chart
must be presented as an independent 'Figure' (flow diagram) to be
published in the main manuscript or as supplementary electroniconly material. For non-inferiority or equivalence studies, cluster trials and for pragmatic and safety studies (reports of harm), the

Descriptive statistics
Distributional properties of the observed data (means, counts, missing data, etc.) should be clearly presented. Authors should select
summary statistics that best present the data concisely. Means (+/- SD)
can be used for normally distributed data and medians and interquartile ranges for data that are not normally distributed or are skewed.
Frequently, the extreme values (minimum or maximum, or other
percentiles, such as the 95th percentile) play an important role in the
interpretation of the data and should also be provided. In general,
'outliers' should not be removed from the dataset to fit distributional
assumptions. Instead, a more robust statistical method should be
considered.

Comparisons between groups
Comparisons between groups should include summaries of the relative difference between the groups. Standardized differences are useful for comparing the relative imbalance between groups, particularly
so for analyses that use weighted selection of subjects to justify control for confounding.42 More generally, differences between groups
should be described with measures of effect size. Reporting effect
size and precision or uncertainty is required to complement hypothesis testing (e.g. adding confidence intervals and relative measures of
association in addition to numeric P-values). When reporting these
relative differences, the underlying data used to estimate the differences should be clearly presented. Please note that absolute differences
between groups should be provided in addition to relative differences. For differences in means, this implies reporting the group means
and standard deviations. For data involving binary endpoints, the
underlying counts, percentages, and if applicable, exposure time
('person years') should be reported individually for each group. Care

should be taken to avoid reporting differences solely based on P-values.43-45 The primary endpoint should be presented as difference between groups with the corresponding confidence intervals. The
calculation of sample size and power of the study for its primary endpoint should be explained in detail.
The EHJ suggests caution with the interpretation of significance
testing. P-values do not provide information on the strength (effect
size) or variability of an estimated association. All P-values for planned
comparisons should be reported regardless of the observed significance level. The use of P-values for secondary endpoints should be
made with caution. Point estimates and margin of error should be
preferred. Tables of descriptive statistics should include columns of
P-values as relevant for the context.
Observational studies are required to have a detailed approach to
address potential sources of confounding. Sensitivity analyses that
examine complementary analysis approaches are required.
Unadjusted results should be provided for context but not reported
as primary findings in the abstract. Adjusted estimates are preferred
for summaries and graphical abstracts. Authors may select from a
number of traditional and modern approaches to adjusting for confounding in the data. The discussion should try to compare and contrast the results, particularly if there is attenuation towards the null
value in the more sophisticated analyses.
Authors must refrain from using 'data not shown' anywhere in the
manuscript. If an empirical statement is made, the statement should
be supported with data presented in line with the text, in a table or
figure in the main body of the paper, or as a supplemental table or
figure.
For clinical trials designed to test superiority hypotheses, data are
generally expected to be reported in accordance with the intentionto-treat principle. A 'full analysis set' may be used if there is no post
baseline data on some cases.40 Non-inferiority study designs, however, need to include also a 'per protocol' analysis set to provide a
conservative interpretation of the data and avoid biasing the results
towards 'equivalence' with the intention-to-treat analysis set. The
methods and results should clarify the analysis set reported in the
paper.
The impact of missing data on findings should be addressed in the
paper through sensitivity analyses which compare the final results
with alternative means of addressing the missing data. Multiple imputation and other methods that facilitate 'chained' estimation of missing
observations are preferred techniques over mean imputation or
complete case analysis. Statements focused on the missing data
mechanism (e.g. missing completely at random) should be provided
with the sensitivity analysis.
For survival plots numbers at risk and censored patients in each
group should be described along the X-axis. For the Y-axis, the entire
range of 0-100% is expected to be reported when survival is the unit
displayed.
For studies developing predictive equations using either standard
model-based approaches or machine learning techniques, results for
model fitting and validation are expected.46 Model optimization
should be assessed, via bootstrap or any dedicated technique to select and validate datasets, when there are no external validation data
available. Calibration of model predictions is to be included alongside
measures of discrimination (e.g. area under the curve and lift plots
are encouraged).

statistical analysis plan has been registered, manuscripts should clearly
distinguish between pre-planned analyses and further analyses generated from examination of data. These should clearly be labelled as
'post hoc' analyses.
Statistical thresholds for claiming an effect of association should
ideally be limited to analysis for which the analysis plan outlines a
method to control for type I error. Two-sided P-values are expected
for all studies. If one-sided testing is desired, the overall significance
level as 2  alpha (e.g. one-sided testing at alpha = 0.05 is equivalent
to two-sided testing at alpha = 0.10) should be reported.40
Correction for multiple testing may be used, but it is recommended
that an adjusted level of significance is used instead of using scaled pvalues. For example, a Bonferroni correction for g = 2 results in a
level of significance per test at 0.05/2. This is preferable to multiplying
the observed P-value by 2 to 'correct' it.
The statistical analyses of any study should aim at presenting the
results and uncertainties in a clinically relevant manner. The description requires a balancing of focus between P-values and estimates of
effect to better ascertain clinical implications. With large datasets,
P-values may not reflect an important difference.
Methods used to produce reproducible research should be discussed.41 Details on statistical packages, software, versions, and
manufacturer should be provided. Along with the data sharing
requirements detailed above, provisions for sharing computation
code, fitted models, and other general dissemination of the work
should be considered and detailed in the methods of the manuscript.

Other general editorial issues
Pre-submission inquiry should include a detailed outline of the proposed article. Fast track review and online publications will be coordinated with late-breaking clinical trials presentation. This will provide
the opportunity to publish new research simultaneously with the first
presentation in selected international scientific meetings. Fast track
submissions will also be considered if they impact on urgent public
health issues or if they provide scientific breakthrough. The EHJ will
consider publication of negative or neutral results of studies performed with a sound methodology addressing relevant clinical
questions.
Manuscripts will be checked for plagiarism at the EHJ editorial office using dedicated software. Reviewers will provide a thoroughly
evaluation of all manuscripts considered for potential publication and
should ensure implementation of the highest standards in manuscript
presentation.
Ongoing initiatives from major funders of public research supporting open access publications (i.e. plan S) are becoming implemented
this year. Irrespective of the final editorial business model which will
be adopted by the journal (current mixed model or Open Access),

..
.. the editors are strongly committed to implement the high quality
.. standards defined in this special article.
..
Attention to diversity is important to guarantee a global vision of
..
.. science.3 Diversity is richness.3 The EHJ considers that this should in..
.. clude authors, reviewers, and Editorial Board. Accordingly, the new
.. Editorial Board who started his activity on September 2020 is charac..
.. terized by his global composition with 13 co-editors from the five
.. continents. The number of women editors has increased from 4 to
..
.. 25 in 2020 and the journal remains committed to further efforts to in.. crease diversity, equity, and inclusion. In regard to manuscript submis..
.. sion, according to the pledge on diversity recently published by the
.. EHJ, authors are requested to report results according to age, gender
..
.. and ethnic characteristics of participants.3
..
The editors believe that the consistent implementation of the
..
.. high-quality standards defined in this special article will help improv.. ing the virtuous circle that supports the scientific process (Graphical

A large proportion of cardiovascular studies address the relation between findings and future outcomes. These relations are presented
as associations, as predictions, and as risk. The EHJ requires authors
to use the concepts carefully and avoid the frequent misuse of terms.
Almost all statistical models can be used to claim association, but it is
much more requiring to claim prediction or risk.
If a new measure is claimed to improve prediction, the statistical
method should reflect recommendations for such analysis.47 This will
require directly addressing discrimination and, when possible, calibration of a new measure. The common use to just presenting a statistical significance of a new marker is insufficient. It is important to
exercise care when choosing parameters to present. While the cindex, defined as the area under the receiver operating characteristic
curve for prediction at a defined time horizon is appropriate,
Harrell's c-index from a Cox model is inappropriate,48 and the popular integrated discrimination improvement and net reclassification
index have been shown to be flawed.49
The concept of risk should also be used carefully. The hazard ratio
of a Cox model is often presented as relative risk. In reality, a hazard
ratio is very difficult to interpret in many situations.50 This can become particularly critical in a situation where there is not only an outcome to examine but also a competing risk-most often 'death from
other causes'. In this situation, a hazard ratio may be misleading and
the association between the immediate risk estimation with hazard
ratio and long-term risk estimation can be very different.51,52 Given
these limitations authors should carefully address what they mean by
risk whenever the concept is used. In most cases, analyses of risk
should be long-term risk at a defined time horizon (e.g. 1 and 5 years).
Such a result has a straightforward clinical interpretation.
