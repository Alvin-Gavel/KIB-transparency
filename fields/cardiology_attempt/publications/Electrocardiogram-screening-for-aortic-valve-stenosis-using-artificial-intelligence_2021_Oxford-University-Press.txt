Aims

Early detection of aortic stenosis (AS) is becoming increasingly important with a better outcome after aortic valve
replacement in asymptomatic severe AS patients and a poor outcome in moderate AS. We aimed to develop artificial intelligence-enabled electrocardiogram (AI-ECG) using a convolutional neural network to identify patients with
moderate to severe AS.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
Between 1989 and 2019, 258 607 adults [mean age 63 +/- 16.3 years; women 122 790 (48%)] with an echocardiography and an ECG performed within 180 days were identified from the Mayo Clinic database. Moderate to severe
and results

AS by echocardiography was present in 9723 (3.7%) patients. Artificial intelligence training was performed in 129
788 (50%), validation in 25 893 (10%), and testing in 102 926 (40%) randomly selected subjects. In the test group,
the AI-ECG labelled 3833 (3.7%) patients as positive with the area under the curve (AUC) of 0.85. The sensitivity,
specificity, and accuracy were 78%, 74%, and 74%, respectively. The sensitivity increased and the specificity
decreased as age increased. Women had lower sensitivity but higher specificity compared with men at any age
groups. The model performance increased when age and sex were added to the model (AUC 0.87), which further
increased to 0.90 in patients without hypertension. Patients with false-positive AI-ECGs had twice the risk for
developing moderate or severe AS in 15 years compared with true negative AI-ECGs (hazard ratio 2.18, 95% confidence interval 1.90-2.50).

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
An AI-ECG can identify patients with moderate or severe AS and may serve as a powerful screening tool for AS in
the community.

Aortic stenosis (AS) has been managed by aortic valve replacement
(AVR) usually when a patient develops symptoms.1 If AVR is not performed at an appropriate time, severe AS can lead to heart failure or
death.2 Recently, benefit of an early AVR was demonstrated even in
asymptomatic patients with severe AS3 and long-term outcome was
found to be poor in patients with moderate AS.4,5 Together with an
increasing number of patients being treated by transcatheter AVR,
the current management paradigm for AS will continue to evolve for
those patients with asymptomatic severe AS or less than severe AS.
During its early or asymptomatic period, AS is usually suspected
by characteristic systolic murmur and confirmed by echocardiography study. However, careful auscultation may not be performed in
asymptomatic patients and auscultation skill has been declining with
advances in cardiac imaging. Actually, systolic murmur is documented
in <50% of patients with moderate or severe AS.6 Hence, there is an
important clinical need for developing a novel and simple tool for
identifying these patients with AS.
In this study, we sought to develop an artificial intelligence-enabled
electrocardiogram (AI-ECG) as a screening tool for moderate to severe AS. The ECG is inexpensive and universally available, making it
an excellent screening tool, but it does not detect AS in its standard
form. However, AS increases left ventricular (LV) afterload, impairs
systolic and diastolic function, and leads to cardiac remodelling with
concomitant electrocardiographic changes.7,8 We hypothesized that
application of artificial intelligence (AI) in the form of a convolutional
neural network (CNN) to the ECG would allow detection of individuals with AS of at least moderate severity.
This study has two objectives: (i) to develop and test the ability of
the AI-ECG to identify patients with moderate to severe AS and (ii)

Data sources and labelling
TTE data were used to classify patients into two groups: echo-positive AS
(th) were those with moderate to severe AS and echo-negative AS (-)
were those with mild or no AS by using published guidelines
(Supplementary material online, Table S1).1,10 If a patient satisfied one of
the following echocardiography parameters, AS severity was classified as
moderate to severe: peak velocity >_3.0 m/s, mean gradient >_20 mmHg,
DVI <_0.35, or AVA <_1.5 cm2.

Transthoracic echocardiogram

Electrocardiogram
All ECGs were acquired as digital standard 12-lead ECGs using a
Marquette ECG machine (GE Healthcare, WI, USA). Their raw data
were stored using the MUSE data management system for later retrieval.

Outcomes
The primary outcome was the ability of the AI-ECG to identify moderate
to severe AS (echo-positive AS). The second outcome was the ability of
the AI network to determine if subjects that are deemed positive by the
AI model (AI-ECG-positive AS) but actually had echo-negative AS at the
time of screening (false positives) had higher risk of developing echopositive AS in the future compared with those who were truly negative
and were deemed negative by the AI model.

Figure 2 Selected model architecture. Selected model architecture is shown, four layers dense block with a growth rate of k = 32.
Each layer takes all preceding feature-maps as input which connects
each layer to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion. The layers
between two dense blocks are referred to as transition layers and
change feature map sizes via convolution and pooling. AS, aortic

Demographic data tabulation
In order to characterize the study population and identify comorbidities
at the time of ECG, the UDP was queried using standardized ICD-9 and
ICD-10 billing codes for each diagnosis within 30 days post-ECG. The
UDP was also queried to assess the referral reasons for TTE.

Overview of artificial intelligence model
development
We developed a CNN model using Keras framework with Tensorflow
(Google; Mountain View, CA, USA) backend implemented in Python.12
This framework was used successfully for creating models to screen LV
contractile dysfunction and to estimate age as well as sex from standard
12-lead ECG.13,14 Each ECG was considered a matrix of the following
dimensions: 12  5000 (representing 12 leads for 10 s duration sampled
at 500 Hz), ECGs that were originally sampled in 250 Hz were upsampled to 500 Hz using the 'Resample' function of the SCIPY python
package15; the 1st dimension is spatial dimension and represents the different ECG leads and the 2nd dimension is temporal. The CNN model is
based on a smaller version of DenseNet with 62 convolutional layers and
1 classification layer (Figure 2).16 DenseNet uses densely connected convolutional blocks to concatenate the result of each convolutional output
within the block in order to extract detailed features. The features
extracted by the dense blocks were fully connected to the final layer that
had two neurons activated using a softmax function, and later were represented as the probabilities of the ECG being from an AS vs. non-AS patient.13,14 Minor modifications regarding zero-padding were made to the
original network to account for the difference in image and ECG matrix
inputs.

To create a model that included tabular variables such as age and sex,
the same CNN architecture and hyper-parameters from the ECG-only
model were used, with the last layer's extracted ECG features concatenated with age and sex prior to the final layer.
Adam optimizer was used for training, with categorical cross-entropy
as the loss function, categorical cross-entropy used even though it is a
binary classifier due to the use of one hot encoding and having one output
neuron for AI-ECG-positive AS and one for AI-ECG-negative AS. Hyperparameters such as learning rate (1e-3) and batch size (64) were tuned
using a validation set. An area under the receiver operating characteristic
curve (ROC AUC) was calculated for the internal validation set after
each epoch. After training completion, the model with the highest validation set AUC was evaluated on the holdout 40% test set. The number of
training epochs was governed by an early stopping strategy, where the
network weights were updated as long as the loss was improving. After
10 epochs without improvement, training was discontinued.
Training of the algorithm was multifaceted. To protect against biasing
our estimate of the model performance, the training data were used exclusively for developing the model architecture. The threshold for classifying an ECG as either a positive or negative screen was determined using
Youden index in the validation data.17 After training, the model was used
to make predictions on the validation set, and an ROC was calculated.
For each point in the curve, the Youden index was calculated, and the

Mean pressure gradient and peak velocity were acquired by continuouswave Doppler from all available transducer positions to obtain the
highest values.10,11 Left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) velocity was
measured by pulsed wave Doppler. DVI was calculated as the ratio between LVOT and aortic valve velocity time integral.9 AVA was calculated
using the continuity equation.9,10

threshold corresponding to the point of highest Youden index was
selected as the optimal threshold. Subsequently, the final model performance was assessed using the testing data. In the training process, we
trained multiple CNN model architectures and selected the one with the
highest AUC of the ROC, using the internal validation set. Precisionrecall and calibration curves were created to assess model performance.

Saliency maps
In order to understand which portion of the ECG weighed in our model's
prediction of AS, we created saliency maps using keras-vis python
package.18

Statistical analysis
All measures of performance are based on the testing data. The ROC
curve was constructed for assessing the model performance formed by
modelling the CNN's prediction of the probability of AI-ECG-positive AS
in relationship to the TTE-positive AS. Applying a threshold determined
in the validation data indicating a positive screen, standard measures of
diagnostic performance (AUC, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy) were
computed. Except for AUC, 95% exact confidence intervals (CI) were
calculated for all measures of diagnostic performance using the large sample approximation of the DeLong method with optimization by the Sun
and Xu method.19 The diagnostic odds ratio, which is the ratio of positive
likelihood ratio [sensitivity/(1 - specificity)] to the negative likelihood ratio
[(1 - sensitivity)/specificity], and the associated 95% CI were also
calculated.
To investigate the prognostic performance of the AI algorithm at
detecting TTE-positive AS over time, all TTE-negative AS patients were
classified into either true negative- or false-positive screens. Of those,
individuals with >_2 TTE-ECG pairs were modelled longitudinally until

the first date of reported as TTE-positive AS. The date of censoring was
set at the last date of all available paired TTE-ECGs and the date of the
first TTE-positive AS during follow-up, if applicable. The log-rank test was
applied. The hazard ratio (HR) and 95% CI were calculated to quantify
the relative differences in the hazard for the development of AS.
Continuous variables were summarized as mean and standard deviation or median [interquartile range (IQR)] when appropriate.
Categorical variables were summarized using numbers and percentages.
To compare subject characteristics across model prediction results (e.g.
true positives, false negatives, etc.), one-way analysis of variance or the
Wilcoxon rank-sum test (non-normal data) was employed. Binary data
were compared with a v2 test. Statistical analyses were computed using
Python 3.6, R version 3.6.2 (The R Foundation, Vienna, Austria) and JMP
software, version 14.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).

Results
Of 480 340 patients who had both TTE and ECG, 258 607 patients
(54%) had valid ECG-TTE pairs (Figure 1). Mean age was
62.9 +/- 16.3 years with 122 790 (48%) women. Median time interval
between ECG and TTE was 0 days (IQR 0, 4); 169 252 (65%) and 232
724 (90%) had them within 1 and 30 days of each other, respectively.
The prevalence of moderate to severe AS (TTE-positive AS) was
3.7%. Of 258 607 patients, 129 788 (50%) were used for training, 25
893 (10%) for validation, and 102 926 (40%) for testing (Graphical abstract). The proportion of patients from each medical centre was
similar between training, validation, and testing groups (e.g. testing
group: Minnesota 70%, Florida 9%, and Arizona 21%). Patients'

Caucasian (88%, n = 90 938) followed by Black (3%, n = 2874),
Hispanic (2%, n = 2129), Asian (1%, n = 1313), and others. The most
common referral reason for TTE was dyspnea followed by hypertension, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and cardiac murmur
(Supplementary material online, Table S2). Of 6351 patients with cardiac murmur as the reason for TTE, moderate or severe AS was diagnosed in 446 (7%). There was a significant difference in several

odds ratio remained >5. Since hypertension shares similar ECG
changes with those from AS, the AUC was calculated separately in
patients with and without hypertension. It was 0.81 and 0.88, respectively. The AUC was 0.89 for those without any comorbidities [n = 31

Figure 5 Long-term incidence of developing moderate or severe
aortic stenosis (AS) in patients with normal or mild AS at initial artificial intelligence electrocardiogram (AI-ECG) classification. Longterm outcome of patients with mild AS or without AS at the time of
initial classification by transthoracic echocardiography is shown. The
incidence of moderate or severe AS is shown and compared between patients with false-positive (FP) results and those with truenegative (TN) results stratified by the initial AI-ECG classification.
The estimated cumulative incidence is reported along the cumulative incidence curve for each group at the times indicated along the
axis. Number at risk is also reported in the lower panel along with
the axis.

Prediction of future aortic stenosis
Of 99 093 (96.3%) echo-negative AS patients in the testing cohort,
29 192 had >_2 ECG-TTE pair with 8474 false-positive AI-ECG (AIECG-positive AS) and 20 718 true negative AI-ECG (AI-ECG-negative AS). With 15 years of follow-up, there were 1796 incident cases
of echo-positive AS from the time of first TTE-ECG pair. The event
rate in the false-positive group was 22.0% vs. 13.1% in the truenegative group (Figure 5). The false-positive group had almost twice
the risk for development of moderate or severe AS compared with
the true-negative group (HR 2.18, 95% CI 1.90-2.50; P < 0.0001). Of
note, in the testing cohort, prevalence of mild AS was 15% (n = 3682)
in the false-positive group and 6% (n = 4648) in the true-negative
group (P < 0.001, Table 3).

Saliency map
Representative ECG example for a patient from the true-positive
group is shown in Figure 6. The precordial leads (especially V1-V3)
are more weighted compared with limb leads and the higher 'saliency'
is frequently located from the end of T wave to the beginning of P
wave (TP segment). Surprisingly, typical ECG findings for LV hypertrophy (e.g. increased R-wave amplitude, increased S-wave depth)
that has been shown to be associated with high afterload in AS are
not weighted.

Discussion
Our study demonstrated that the AI-ECG, a simple routine test, can
successfully identify patients with moderate to severe AS with high
performance (AUC 0.85), comparable or superior to currently used
medical tests including pap smear detecting cervical uterine cancer
(AUC 0.71)20 and AI-interpret mammography detecting breast cancer (AUC 0.76-0.89).21
Aortic stenosis is usually suspected by a characteristic systolic
murmur on auscultation and diagnosed by echocardiography, but

may not be detected until symptoms develop6,22 as demonstrated in
the illustrative case (Supplementary material online, Figure S2).
Auscultation of cardiac murmur is an important clinical finding in
detecting valvular heart disease, but it was found that murmur was a
key leading to the diagnosis of AS only in 62% of asymptomatic
patients.22 Kattoor et al.6 reviewed 95 patients with moderate to severe AS diagnosed by echocardiography, and they found that murmur of AS was identified by only 39% of clinicians. They also
reported that auscultation skill varies among physicians based on
their specialty or experiences; AS murmur was detected in 87% of
the patients seen by cardiology specialists, 50% by other medical specialists and <20% by non-medical clinicians. Thus, training in auscultation can potentially improve detection rate for AS; however, our
physical examination skills have been eroding in the era of advanced
imaging techniques. Therefore, our AI-ECG will be helpful and
expected to increase the detection of AS even without symptoms or
documented AS murmur.
Our AI-ECG model performed well (AUC 0.85) with high sensitivity and specificity in the identification of patients with moderate to severe AS. However, a careful interpretation is necessary especially
when the model indicates presence of AS. With a prevalence of moderate or severe AS of about 4%, the positive predictive value was low
and there may be a concern for performing unnecessary echocardiography examinations in the AI-ECG positive patients. The AI-ECG
result thus needs to be integrated into clinical evaluation including
comorbidities associated with AS, symptomatic status, and more
careful auscultation before performing additional tests. Another important clinical value of AI-ECG is its high negative predictive value
close to 99%. It will be thus helpful if AI-ECG can be used for excluding AS. Systolic murmur is non-specific and a minority of the patients

referred to echocardiography laboratory for evaluation of cardiac
murmur are diagnosed with AS. When we reviewed 6351 patients
who were referred to echocardiography because of cardiac murmur
among the testing group, only 446 patients (7%) were diagnosed to
have moderate or severe AS. Our AI-ECG model with the excellent
negative predictive value can reduce the number of unnecessary
imaging in patients with non-significant murmur. There was a significant false-positive rate in our model, but a false-positive test indicates
elevated future risk of developing significant AS (Figure 5). This is
probably due to the fact that the prevalence of mild AS was more frequent in the false-positive group compared with the true-negative
group (Table 3). Also, in the false-positive group, prevalence of hypertension and renal disease was higher compared with other groups
(Table 4). These comorbidities are known to be associated with LV
hypertrophy, and it may be thus possible that the AI-ECG identified
them as AS positive. Patients with AI-ECG positive for AS warrant a
close follow-up and surveillance even if AS murmur is absent.
Until recently, little effort has been made for detecting patients
with AS in its earlier asymptomatic stage since patients are usually
treated by AVR when they become symptomatic. However, symptoms are subjective and the lack of AS-related symptoms is not benign. Sudden death was reported in 4.1% in patients with

asymptomatic severe AS,23 and a recent clinical trial demonstrated a
better clinical outcome in early AVR in this population.3 Moreover,
emerging risk factors such as brain natriuretic peptide and imaging
evidence of myocardial fibrosis will likely expand the indication for
AVR in asymptomatic severe AS patients.24 Irreversible replacement
by fibrosis is a major consequence of LV response to the pressure
overload imposed by AS7,25 which often does not normalize after
AVR.26 Reduced LV ejection fraction (LVEF) has been shown to be
associated with worse survival outcomes despite AVR.27 Patients
with reduced LVEF and severe AS have evidence of abnormal systolic
function as early as 10 years prior to developing severe AS with more
precipitous decline at AVA of 1.2 cm2.27 As shown in the illustrative
case (Supplementary material online, Figure S2), LVEF was reduced to
25% when the patient presented with pulmonary oedema. His LVEF
did not improve after AVR and heart failure symptoms continued. In
such patients, early detection of AS by an AI-ECG could potentially
provide improved timing of AVR with better clinical outcome.
Besides AVR, earlier detection of AS can potentially provide another
treatment option in the coming future. An ideal management strategy
of AS is a medical therapy to delay or prevent the progression of aortic valve calcification or haemodynamic severity. Although several trials using statin or lipid-lowering agents have failed to prove its

Kwon et al.31 described a similar concept as our study in a Korean
..
.. population. Their model is well designed with high AUC of 0.861 on
.. external test group and included age, sex, height, weight, body mass
..
.. index, and ECG measurements in addition to ECG morphology. We
.. thus tested several models; when we added clinical and ECG data to
..
.. our model just based on ECG morphology, AI-ECG with age, and sex
.. improved the AUC (from 0.85 to 0.87). Our model performance
..
.. was comparable with the model from the Korean population (0.87
.. vs. 0.86); however, our main purpose is developing a model as a sim..
.. ple screening tool, thus, the number of variables in our model was
.. minimum. Our study embodies several subtle but potentially import..
.. ant differences relative to the work of Kwon et al. While our net.. work's training population is significantly larger, an aspect traditionally
..
.. considered an advantage, there is an accompanying diversity in the
.. patients included. Notably, the study by Kwon et al. focuses on a pre..
.. dominantly Asian population. Our cohort included three geographic.. ally different centres in the USA with the majority of patients being
..
.. Caucasian (88%), followed by Black (3%), Hispanic (2%), and Asian
..
.. (1%) in the testing group. Lastly, for the training of the AI model,
.. Kwon group used several ECGs per patient.31 On the other hand,
..
.. our study used single ECG per patient in the training for preventing
.. the biased testing and providing spurious high accuracy. Regardless of
..
.. these differences, both studies successfully confirmed that AI-ECG is
.. able to screen patients with AS with clinically useful power.
..
While in this study we focus on the AI-ECG's ability to screen for
..
.. AS, using the AI-ECG to simultaneously screen for other cardiac dis..
.. ease such as LV dysfunction, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and silent
.. atrial fibrillation,13,14,33 may allow for a comprehensive identification
..
.. of the individuals at high risk for having concealed, treatable cardio.. vascular disease who may need to undergo echocardiography or
..
.. other diagnostic testing after a more careful clinical evaluation. There
.. is a concern that the AI-ECG model may identify 'cardiac disease' in
..
.. general as opposed to being specific to a certain condition. When we
.. applied the AI-ECG model developed for screening reduced LVEF to
..
.. our testing population, its AUC was 0.59 (not shown) in detecting
.. moderate to severe AS, suggesting that our model is indeed learning
..
.. features specific to AS. Such a broad strategy may improve cardiac
..
.. health, augment adoption of evidence-based treatments, and opti.. mize utilization of expensive imaging resources in the community.
..
Finally, our model was developed in patients who were referred to

..

beneficial effect, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor has recently been
shown to delay the progression of aortic valve calcification in an animal model and to delay progression of AS in diabetic patients in a
retrospective study.28,29 A post hoc analysis of FOURIER exploratory
data showed that proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9
(PCSK9) inhibitor, evolocumab, showed a significant 52% relative reduction in AS events compared with control patients.30 If their beneficial effect can be confirmed in a prospective clinical trial, it will be
even more critical to identify patients with earlier stage of AS.
It will be helpful to know which features of the ECG contribute to
the AI-ECG's ability to detect AS. As demonstrated in Table 4, there
are significant differences in ECG features between true-positive,
true-negative, false-positive, and false-negative groups. However,
these values fall within the normal range and poorly contributed to
the model performance. It is thus unlikely that these would be useful
features for identification of AS during manual ECG interpretation.
On the other hand, a saliency map shows that TP segment or U wave
in the right precordial leads is weighted most heavily for determining
the presence of AS in our model. Surprisingly, the QRS complex (e.g.
increased R-wave amplitude or increased S-wave depth that is typical
for patients with LV hypertrophy in response to AS) is not weighted.
Somewhat paradoxically, even though LV hypertrophy is a known
key adaptation mechanism of the heart to AS, it does not appear to
play a major role in this AI-ECG model. This finding has been
observed in other similar studies. The AI-ECG model for AS from a
Korean population using CNN showed that the initial area of T wave
in V2-V5 was the most important region in their model for determining the presence of AS using a sensitivity map.31 Although the number
was small (n = 700), the AI-ECG model for AS from the Japanese
population showed that ST-T segment is weighted using the gradientweighted class activation mapping.32 Neither of these studies demonstrated importance of the QRS complex or typical LV hypertrophy
findings on ECG. Further studies are necessary to understand the
physiologic underpinnings of these ECG findings.
Our model performance improved when age and sex were added
to ECG morphology. Furthermore, our data showed that there was
a sex difference in sensitivity and specificity of AI-ECG; higher sensitivity and lower specificity in men than in women across all age
groups (Figure 3). Sex difference in LV remodelling in AS has been
shown, which may explain the finding.25 Furthermore, the AI-ECG
had higher sensitivity and lower specificity in older population. With
ageing, there is increased incidence of hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, and diastolic dysfunction. Electrocardiogram
changes perhaps related to these conditions may do share some features of AS-related changes. Comorbidities can produce similar ECG
changes as AS. Indeed, there was a significant difference in the prevalence of comorbidities between AS (th) and AS (-) patients. It is
therefore interesting to find that AI-ECG performed better in
patients without any comorbidities including hypertension.
The network our model created successfully characterized the levels of AS severity (Figure 4). There was a positive correlation between
the probabilities of AS labelled by the neural network and AS severity
by TTE. It means more distinct ECG changes develop as the severity
of AS progresses. This also explains a better performance of AI-ECG
for detecting patients with severe AS. In addition, patients who had
false-positive results were shown to have a significantly higher risk of

Conclusion
Application of AI in the form of a CNN to a 12-lead ECG-an inexpensive, ubiquitous, commonly used test-enables it to serve as a
powerful screening tool for the detection of patients with moderate
to severe AS.

Arizona, and Florida), thus covering diverse patient populations.
Some important clinical information such as cardiac murmur is lacking
in this study to see how our AI-ECG model performs in patients with
or without cardiac murmur. Since we use large dataset, it is difficult
to review all medical record to check the presence of murmur.
However, of 6351 patients with referral reason of cardiac murmur
for TTE, only 7% were found to have moderate or severe AS. AIECG will be thus clinically helpful for excluding significant AS even in
patients with cardiac murmur, although some of them may have
another valvular heart disease. Although negative predictive value
was high as 99% in our model indicating excellent accuracy of
negative results, false negative was present in 1%. Clinical
characteristics of the false-negative patients were similar to those of
true-positive patients, but significantly different from the truenegative group (Table 4). The false-negative group had a higher proportion of moderate AS and lower aortic valve velocity compared
with the true-positive group, which might have been responsible for
less characteristic ECG changes of AS (Table 3). We will therefore
need further investigation to explain why ECG morphology in falsenegative patients resembles that of the true-negative group. We did
not test our AI-ECG model in an external group to assess its generalizability in this study. Additional testing of our AI-ECG in different
races and different parts of the world is currently planned. AI-ECG
has varying sensitivities and specificities for different sex, age, and
comorbidities. We will need to refine our AI-ECG model based on
patient's sex, age, and clinical conditions sharing ECG changes seen in
AS to increase the screening diagnostic accuracy even higher. In this
study, only one type of ECG machine was used and other ECG machine was not available in the current study. Therefore, we cannot
discuss how different types of ECG machine impact on the results.
Lastly, haemodynamics of AS depends on the flow status and there
are several different types of AS but it was not addressed in the current study. Stress test is helpful in reclassifying the severity of AS and
also risk stratification based on the extent of increase in pressure gradient as well as other clinical and haemodynamic data.34 However,
we did not include stress test result for this study.
