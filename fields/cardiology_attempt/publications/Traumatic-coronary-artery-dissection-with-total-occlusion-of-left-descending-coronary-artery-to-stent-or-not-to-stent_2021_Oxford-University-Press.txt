A 21-year-old man was admitted at the Emergency
Department after a motorcycle accident with frontal
crash into a tree. A computerized tomography scan confirmed Le Fort III fracture, hepatic laceration, and haemoperitoneum. An electrocardiogram was performed as
part of the initial evaluation, showing ST-segment elevation in leads I, aVL, V1, and V2, with ST depression in inferior leads (Panel A). The patient denied chest pain.
Transthoracic echocardiogram showed septal hypokinesia, with preserved ejection fraction. Troponin was positive (Tn I 20.2 ng/mL). Coronary angiography was
performed, showing ostial left anterior descending artery
occlusion (Panel B and Supplementary material Online,
Video S1), with Rentrop 2 coronary collaterals.
Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) interrogation revealed an
occlusive coronary dissection with thrombosis of the
false lumen (Panel C and Supplementary material Online,
Video S2). Considering the mechanism of the occlusion,
the total length of the occluded segment and the potential bleeding risk associated to the fractures and liver laceration, a free-stent strategy was chosen, in order to
avoid dual antiplatelet therapy. Accordingly, a cutting balloon 3  10 mm was advanced through the occlusion
and several inflations at 6-8 atm were performed, restoring TIMI III flow (Panel D and Supplementary material
Online, Video S3). The proximal vessel was treated with
an AngioSculpt balloon 3.5  15 mm. Post-IVUS pullback
showed good luminal area of the true lumen (Panel E and
Supplementary material Online, Video S4).
