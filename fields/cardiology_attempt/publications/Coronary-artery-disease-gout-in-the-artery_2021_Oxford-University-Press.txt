In medicine, it is not uncommon that phenotypically quite different diseases end up having similar pathways in their pathogenesis. In this vein, recent trials with canakinumab (Canakinumab Anti-inflammatory
Thrombosis Outcome Study, CANTOS1), and with colchicine-most

(ASCVD), intuitively considered to be very apart from each other.
While the clinical and pathogenetic characteristics of ASCVD have
received much attention during the past decades, the characteristics
of gout may be less familiar to cardiologists. The primary tissue targets in these two diseases, i.e. joints and kidneys in gout, and arteries

formation of cholesterol-containing xanthomatous skin and tendon
nodules.
In ASCVD, the root cause is hypercholesterolaemia, which is
pathophysiologically relevant at LDL cholesterol level >1.4 mmol/L
(55 mg/dL) and predisposes to the harmful intrusion of LDL particles
into the arterial wall.8 In the arterial wall, the LDL particles become
oxidized or otherwise modified and then induce an immunological
and inflammatory response, which, together with local cholesterol
accumulation becomes the nidus to the development of an atherosclerotic plaque. An interesting parallel to gout is that like urate in the
joint, free cholesterol relieved from LDL particles may crystallize in
the arterial wall. Mechanistically then, the connection between cholesterol and the inflammatory component of ASCVD can be partly
explained by the fact that, like cellular uptake of the monosodium
urate crystals, also the uptake of cholesterol crystals activates the
NLRP3 inflammasome and induces IL-1b secretion with ensuing local
inflammation.5,6 Whether an additional activation signal is needed,
e.g. via uptake of LDL-derived oxysterols by the macrophages, is currently debated.9 Nevertheless, the inflammatory process predisposes
to the formation of vulnerable plaques susceptible to rupture and
ensuing acute cardiovascular events. This may be seen as analogous
to a gout flare.
From a treatment point of view, recent evidence tells us that both
gout and ASCVD 'flares' can be counteracted by the same therapies.
In CANTOS, a fully human anti-IL-1b neutralizing monoclonal antibody, canakinumab, reduced residual ASCVD risk in patients already
on maximal lipid-lowering therapy.1 But canakinumab also reduced
gout attacks.10
Similarly, in COLCOT2 and LoDoCo2,3 colchicine, an ancient
medication historically known to be effective in acute gout, reduced
ASCVD endpoints on top of lipid-lowering therapy. While canakinumab selectively blocks IL-1b, colchicine, as a natural product, has a
wider range of anti-inflammatory effects, also upstream of the
NLRP3.11,12
We have earlier compared the effects of intensification of LDL
cholesterol lowering, i.e. when adding proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin-type 9 inhibitor (PCSK9i) therapy on top of statin therapy
to those achieved when adding an anti-inflammatory drug on top of
statin therapy.13 This comparison indicated that inflammation inhibition is effective on top of very aggressive LDL lowering. Of the
CANTOS, COLCOT, and LoDoCo2 participants, almost everyone
received concomitant optimal statin therapy (although the levels of
blood lipids were not reported in the colchicine trials). In the two
PCSK9i trials, ODYSSEY (similar to COLCOT regarding a recent
coronary artery disease event with ensuing myocardial ischaemia)
and FOURIER (similar to LoDoCo2 regarding the presence of chronic coronary artery disease), practically all patients received statin
therapy of at least moderate intensity.13 Despite statin treatment, the
average LDL cholesterol levels were 92 mg/dL (2.4 mmol/L) at baseline, which is well above the 55 mg/dL (1.4 mmol/L) level considered
to protect from the progression of ASCVD.
The primary cardiovascular disease endpoints in both COLCOT
and LoDoCo2 started to decline very early after the initiation of colchicine therapy, and they were mainly due to a reduction of myocardial infarction and acute ischaemia-driven revascularization.2,3 Thus,
in principle, colchicine administration for coronary artery disease
resembled 'gout therapy'.

in ASCVD are completely different. Accordingly, we do not intend to
claim that hyperuricaemia, the root cause of gout, would affect the
developing ASCVD. Of note, although numerous studies have suggested that uric acid may play roles in ASCVD, the causal connection
is still controversial.4 Likewise, there is no indication that hypercholesterolaemia as such would be involved in gout. However, there are
interesting parallels between their basic pathologies, acute treatments, and management of their risk factors, hyperuricaemia and
hypercholesterolaemia, respectively. This being a Viewpoint, we take
the freedom to assess basic pathology through a 'crystal lens',5,6 and
intentionally give less attention to the roles of the myriad of other
factors related to the multifactorial pathogenesis of ASCVD.
In brief, gout is becoming a more widespread type of chronic inflammatory arthritis, affecting up to 4-9% of adults in some Western
and Asian societies.7 Its classic and dramatic presentation is characterized by recurrent attacks (flares) of red, painful, hot, and swollen
joints, especially in the base of the big toe, knee, and less commonly
in other joints. Like cholesterol, uric acid is a natural product being
the metabolic breakdown of purine nucleotides, either from endogenous or dietary sources. It is mainly excreted via kidneys as a
normal component of urine. In the body, uric acid presents as such,
or as ions and salts (urates). In gout, the normal homeostasis of uric
acid metabolism is disturbed-most commonly due to reduced excretion-leading to its high circulating concentrations (hyperuricaemia), which may then lead to acute episodes of joint inflammation
and kidney stones. This is because hyperuricaemia predisposes to
high uric acid concentrations also in tissues, thereby increasing the
possibility of local formation of monosodium urate crystals. The crystals trigger primarily in mononuclear phagocytes, such as macrophages, an inflammatory response which is mediated by the
nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-(Nod-)like receptor3
(NLRP3) inflammasome, and leads to caspase-1-dependent conversion of pro-interleukin (IL) 1b into mature IL-1b that may be secreted
by the cells. On the cell surfaces of several cell types, the secreted IL1b binds to IL-1 receptors, which then activate a signalling pathway
leading to the activation of the transcription factor nuclear factorkappa B. Ultimately, this inflammatory cascade leads to the release of
various inflammatory cytokines, chemotactic factors, lysosomal
enzymes, eicosanoids, and reactive oxygen species, which affect a
host of inflammatory cells, prominently including various mononuclear phagocytes, and also neutrophils and mast cells.
However, the crystals alone do not seem to be able to trigger the
flare; a second signal is also required.7 Free fatty acids can be this signal, and their involvement helps to explain the classic picture of an
acute gout attack after a heavy meal and alcohol consumption. In the
absence of any treatment, the resolution of inflammation takes place
as an active and timely process, which ultimately leads to the restoration of homeostasis.
It is noteworthy that 85-90% of people with hyperuricaemia never
suffer from acute flares, just as not all persons with hypercholesterolaemia experience a heart attack. However, if the solubility of urate is
exceeded, crystals can nevertheless trigger a chronic inflammatory
response presenting as urate-containing nodules, tophi, which protrude from the skin, accumulate in various tissues, and cause bone
erosions. This situation closely resembles familial hypercholesterolaemia in which very high cholesterol concentrations cause the

'Gout' in the artery?

Conclusion
In a 'system biology perspective', inflammation and its potential triggers, the crystals, are unifying factors in the pathophysiology of both
gout and ASCVD (Graphical abstract). Furthermore, therapies to diminish the crystal-induced inflammation with canakinumab or colchicine have been shown to prevent the respective clinical presentations,
especially the acute ones. A final common similarity is that the root
causes-hyperuricaemia in gout and hypercholesterolaemia in
ASCVD-must be effectively addressed to attain the best results for
patients in the long term.

Inflammation is involved in various disease processes and, for example in CANTOS,1 IL-1b inhibition also reduced the risk of anaemia
and knee osteoarthritis. It is of note that despite reducing acute
effects and endpoints in gout and ASCVD, neither canakinumab nor
colchicine reduces the root cause of gout and ASCVD: plasma uric
acid and LDL cholesterol level, respectively. Neither do they, at present, seem suitable for long-term prevention, because of high cost
(canakinumab) or possible concerns about overall safety (colchicine).14 More research is needed on the latter, and overall on focused
therapies upstream of NLRP3 inflammasome. However, if the root
cause, i.e. hyperuricaemia or hypercholesterolaemia are kept at bay,
it is obvious that there would be no urate crystals to induce flares or
cholesterol crystals to contribute to ASCVD. Concerning the marching order of the pathophysiological factors in ASCVD, it is intriguing
that in the primitive Tsimane population neither a high infectious burden nor a high C-reactive protein level was associated with ASCVD,
most probably because the LDL cholesterol level in this population is
very low.15 This notion is supported by the crude similarity of benefits achieved by an anti-inflammatory therapy on top of the moderate
baseline LDL cholesterol level (82 mg/dL; 2.1 mmol/L) in CANTOS
and, alternatively, by a very effective LDL cholesterol lowering down
to 40 mg/dL (1.0 mmol/L) involving PCSK9i therapy without the need
for additional anti-inflammatory treatment.1,13 However, neither
therapy could fully abolish residual risk, the probable explanation for
this being a late start of the treatment when considering the normally
long latent period before the onset of clinical ASCVD.
Accordingly, there is further parallelism between gout and
ASCVD: the necessity of a long-term strategy to prevent endpoints
by addressing the root cause of the respective disease to be treated.
In gout, a prolonged effective urate-lowering therapy by xanthine oxidase inhibitors like allopurinol or febuxostat, uricosurics, absorption
inhibitors, or uricase agents can effectively reduce the frequency of
gout attacks because the rate of crystal dissolution is slow and proportional to the degree of the urate-lowering achieved.7 In ASCVD,
again, a therapy that inhibits hepatic cholesterol synthesis (statin),
inhibits intestinal cholesterol absorption (ezetimibe), or prevents the
degradation of hepatic LDL receptors (PCSKi), ultimately stimulates
the hepatic LDL receptor-mediated uptake of LDL particles, and has
been used either alone or in combination to control LDL cholesterol
level in the circulation. The efficacy of these therapies for reducing
ASCVD endpoints is firmly established.8 Although xanthine oxidase
inhibitors are implicated to affect surrogate endpoints (blood pressure and endothelial function), their effects on clinical outcomes of
ASCVD have not been established.4 Inversely, cholesterol lowering is
not known to affect uric acid or gout.
