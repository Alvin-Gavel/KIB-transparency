of peripheral artery disease in Australia and New Zealand?', by C.-A. Behrendt, https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab143.

Aims

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) revascularization can be performed by either endovascular or open surgical approach. Despite increasing use of endovascular revascularization, it is still uncertain which strategy yields better
long-term outcomes.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
This retrospective cohort study evaluated patients hospitalized with PAD in Australia and New Zealand who
and results
underwent either endovascular or surgical revascularization between 2008 and 2015, and compared procedures
using a propensity score-matched analysis. Hybrid interventions were excluded. The primary endpoint was mortality or major adverse limb events (MALE), defined as a composite endpoint of acute limb ischaemia, urgent surgical
or endovascular reintervention, or major amputation, up to 8 years post-hospitalization using time-to-event analyses 75 189 patients fulfilled eligibility (15 239 surgery and 59 950 endovascular), from whom 14 339 matched pairs
(mean +/- SD age 71 +/- 12 years, 73% male) with good covariate balance were identified. Endovascular revascularization was associated with an increase in combined MALE or mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 1.13, 95% confidence
interval (CI): 1.09-1.17, P < 0.001]. There was a similar risk of MALE (HR 1.04, 95% CI: 0.99-1.10, P = 0.15), and
all-cause urgent rehospitalizations (HR 1.01, 95% CI: 0.98-1.04, P = 0.57), but higher mortality (HR 1.16, 95% CI:
1.11-1.21, P < 0.001) when endovascular repair was compared to surgery. In subgroup analysis, these findings
were consistent for both claudication and chronic limb-threatening ischaemia presentations.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
Although the long-term risk of MALE was comparable for both approaches, enduring advantages of surgical revas-

cularization included lower long-term mortality. This is at odds with some prior PAD studies and highlights contention in this space.

Graphical Abstract

Introduction
In Western countries, peripheral artery disease (PAD) becomes
more prevalent with increasing age and affects more than 14% of
people above the age of 70. The disease burden is expected to increase due to ageing demographics and the rise in metabolic risk factors.1 Peripheral artery disease exists as a spectrum spanning
asymptomatic subclinical disease, stable claudication, and chronic
limb-threatening ischaemia (CLTI), which is associated with ulceration, gangrene, and amputation.2,3 Peripheral artery revascularization may be performed to improve symptoms, walking distance,
wound healing, or limb salvage. Traditionally, revascularization was
achieved with open surgical repair, where lower extremity atherosclerotic plaques are removed by endarterectomy or bypassed using
an autogenous vein or prosthetic graft.4 Endovascular repair, consisting of balloon angioplasty with or without stent insertion, has evolved
and has rapidly gained dominance as the more commonly used approach to revascularization.5
The popularity of endovascular repair stems from the less-invasive
nature of these procedures, shorter length of hospital stay, and a perceived reduction in periprocedural complications compared with
open surgery.6,7 However, persisting debate exists as to whether surgical repair leads to more durable vascularization, and therefore is
associated with less reintervention, lower long-term risk of major adverse limb events (MALE), and possibly differences in long-term survival. Current evidence favouring either strategy is limited, with few
randomized trials directly comparing endovascular or surgical repair.8
Existing clinical trials have also been restricted by small sample size,
open-label, and non-comparative designs, limiting the strength of
their conclusions.9 So, despite the widespread use of revascularization

.. for PAD treatment, the optimal strategy for durable outcomes has
..
.. not been determined.
..
In this study, we compared the long-term incidence of combined
..
.. mortality or MALE following either surgery or endovascular revascu.. larization using national data from Australia and New Zealand. We

Study population
We included patients aged >_18 years who were hospitalized with a primary diagnosis of PAD (or equivalent) and had procedure code indicating
surgical or endovascular peripheral artery revascularization during their
admission. Diabetes with lower extremity complications, lower-limb
osteomyelitis, or a procedure for lower extremity osteomyelitis were
considered as PAD-equivalent diagnoses in the context of revascularization. This mirrored previously published methods.14,15 ICD-10-AM diagnoses and ACHI procedure codes were used to define these encounters
(Supplementary material online, Table S1). We excluded patients with hybrid interventions where surgery and an endovascular intervention were
coded during the same admission. We also excluded patients who discharged against medical advice. For patients with multiple admissions in
the study period, the first hospitalization was considered the index encounter to prevent double counting of patients and to ensure included
patients were unique. Subsequent hospitalizations for these patients
were considered as outcomes if they met the outcome definition(s).
Presentations with rest pain, osteomyelitis, ulceration, or gangrene were
classified as CLTI, whereas all others were considered to be intermittent
claudication.

Study outcomes
The primary outcome was the incidence of a combined endpoint of allcause mortality and MALE, which was defined as a primary diagnosis of
acute limb ischaemia, urgent endovascular reintervention or embolectomy, urgent surgical reintervention, or major amputation (defined as
occurring at or above the ankle). Secondary endpoints were individual
components of the primary outcome, major bleeding, all-cause urgent
rehospitalization, and less-severe adverse limb events, including elective
surgical or endovascular reintervention, and minor amputation (defined
as occurring below the ankle). Urgent reinterventions and urgent rehospitalizations were defined as clinical conditions requiring admission within 24 h consistent with the definition of emergency hospitalization,16 with
all other hospitalizations defined as an elective (scheduled or planned) encounter. The diagnosis and procedure codes used to identify these events
are available in the Supplementary material online, Table S2.

Statistical analysis
Data are summarized as frequencies and percentages for categorical variables. For continuous variables, we assessed the normality of the data by
assessing the distribution of data points. Continuous variables are presented as mean and standard deviation for normally distributed variables
or median and interquartile range (IQR) for non-normally distributed

.. variables. The v2 test, Fisher's exact test, and Student's t-test were used
..
.. to compare endovascular and surgical intervention as appropriate.
..
We used propensity score matching to account for differences in base..
.. line characteristics arising from the non-random assignment of surgical or
.. endovascular intervention. We first developed a propensity score, indi..
.. cating the conditional probability that any individual patient would under.. go endovascular intervention using a logistic regression model. Variables
.. included patient age, gender, geographic region, PAD history, cardiovas..
.. cular history, and other comorbidities. Cardiac history and comorbidities
.. were derived using the Condition Categories classification,17,18 which
..
.. groups ICD-10-AM codes into clinically meaningful comorbidities using
.. secondary diagnosis codes from the index hospitalization, as well as the
..
.. principal and secondary diagnosis codes from all hospitalizations in the
.. preceding 12 months (see Supplementary material online, Table S3, which
.. outlines the Condition Categories used to define comorbidities). Patients
..
.. undergoing endovascular intervention were then matched 1:1 without
.. replacement to patients who underwent surgery based on the propensity
..
.. score using a calliper width of 0.01 to derive a propensity score-matched
.. cohort.19 Covariate balance post-matching was assessed by estimating
..
absolute standardized difference between the treatment
.. the mean
.. groups.20 Due to the potential heterogeneity among patients, we con.. ducted analyses of outcomes in patients with CLTI and intermittent clau..
.. dication separately, reoptimizing the propensity score and matching 1:1
.. within each group.
..
Unadjusted event-free survival curves in the propensity score..
.. matched cohort were generated using Kaplan-Meier estimates and com.. pared using the log-rank test. All time-to-event outcomes were reported
..
.. as hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) with patients
.. treated with surgery as the reference group. The significance levels were
..
.. two-sided with a P < 0.05. No correction for multiple hypothesis testing
.. was applied. The analyses were conducted using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute
..
.. Inc., Cary, NC, USA).

..
.. baseline characteristics of the matched CLTI and intermittent claudi.. cation cohorts remained similar (Supplementary material online,

accuracy with cardiovascular diagnoses and procedures, and lower-limb
amputations being particularly well coded.11,12
In Australia, the patients' hospitalization was linked to subsequent
events in any hospital and each region's Registry of Deaths to assess longterm outcomes. Linkages of all health records were performed using
probabilistic matching techniques based on multiple patient identifiers by
designated data-linkage units within each region. This approach has been
shown to have a low likelihood of linkage errors.13 In New Zealand, hospital encounters are linked nationally using a unique National Health
Index number, and all deaths are recorded in the National Health Index
sociodemographic profile.
The Human Research Ethics Committees of all respective Australian
states and territories provided ethics approval to undertake the study
with a waiver of informed consent to use de-identified patient data. Data
from New Zealand are obtained under a data user agreement with the
New Zealand Ministry of Health.

similar at 6 months, 1, and 5 years (Supplementary material online,

model to adjust for variables with a post-matching standardised difference >_5%, endovascular revascularisation was still significantly
associated with the primary outcome (Supplemental material online,

Discussion
This study evaluated the long-term outcomes of lower extremity
revascularization in an Australian and New Zealand population. After
propensity score matching, patients undergoing endovascular repair
had similar rates of MALE throughout follow-up compared with
those having surgery. Nevertheless, the endovascular approach was
associated with a 16% higher risk of mortality, 13% higher risk of the
combination of MALE or mortality, 40% higher risk of minor amputation, and 50% greater need for elective endovascular reintervention.
However, it should be noted that differences in the cumulative incidence of adverse events at the end of follow-up were modest. There
were no significant differences in major bleeding or all-cause urgent
rehospitalization. These trends were evident for both claudication
and CLTI presentations. The durable benefits of surgical revascularization were different from some prior observations, and they underscore a need for further debate and research on the optimal
revascularization strategy for patients with PAD.
Few randomized studies have compared endovascular and surgical
revascularization outcomes. The BASIL trial featured 452 patients
presenting with CLTI randomized to initial bypass surgery or balloon
angioplasty. No significant differences in amputation-free survival

were apparent during the first 2 years, although beyond that time,
open surgery was associated with higher amputation-free survival.8,22
Our findings are consistent with the BASIL trial's long-term outcomes, with the matched surgery patients demonstrating a lower
long-term risk of mortality, in addition to major amputation. The
BASIL trial had caveats that would limit generalizability to current
practice. The study investigated a modest number of patients and
only CLTI presentations. Participant recruitment began 20 years ago,
in an era before modern endovascular techniques, such as stenting. A
high proportion (25%) of surgical patients received a prosthetic graft,
which is less durable than the saphenous vein graft4,7 and is now less
commonly used.22,23 In our cohort, encounters from 2008 onwards
were chosen to reflect current vascular practice, thus incorporating
more advanced endovascular interventions and progress in surgical
planning. The endovascular approach was preferred, as evidenced by
an approximate 4:1 ratio of endovascular to surgery cases in the unmatched groups, consistent with other recent observational studies.24,25 It can also be argued that the results of earlier studies have
become less applicable, with the evolution of medical therapy, public
health messages regarding smoking, clinical guidelines, and the familiarity that specialists have with newer procedures.26-28 These trends
necessitate a comparative analysis in a more contemporary setting
than with the BASIL study.
We assessed two national populations, which should provide
broader generalizability of our results than previous small and singlecentre studies.29-31 Data from a specific institution have more potential for unique influences relating to procedural experience, patient
selection, and local clinical practices.26 From the small number of
larger observational studies that compared outcomes of different
PAD interventions, endovascular revascularization has typically been
followed by more favourable outcomes. Wiseman et al.14 found the
endovascular approach to be associated with a lower adjusted risk of
death or major amputation (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.79-0.89) after up to
4 years, compared with surgery. This study drew from a narrow (5%)
sample of all US Medicare hospitalizations between 2006 and 2009,
once again representing a more historical cohort. These patients
were older, as all individuals were above 65, and they had more cardiovascular comorbidities and CLTI presentations than our study.
The 4-year incidence of death and major amputation was 48.6% for
endovascular and 54.0% for surgery patients (P < 0.001), compared
with 37.3% and 35.8%, respectively, in the current study with a median follow-up of 4.2 years. Hence, we examined a lower-risk clinical
setting. Lin et al.15 found open surgery to be associated with worse
amputation-free survival (HR 1.16, 95% CI 1.13-1.20), without a
mortality difference (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.89-1.11). They assessed
PAD revascularizations performed for CLTI within a Californian
state-wide dataset. Fewer covariates were used for the propensity
score-matched analysis, and therefore, there was less emphasis on
baseline PAD and cardiovascular history. Meanwhile, Tsai et al.32 performed a smaller study comparing 883 patients who underwent
endovascular repair with 975 who had PAD surgery. There were no
differences in amputation rates, but endovascular revascularization
was again associated with lower mortality than surgery. From these
aforementioned studies, much less information was available about
outcomes in patients with intermittent claudication than CLTI.
Intermittent claudication is a lower-risk disease than CLTI.2

Subgroup analysis
In subgroup analyses of Australia and New Zealand, men and women,
individuals of age <75 and those of age >_75 years, endovascular
revascularization was consistently associated with significantly higher
rates of composite MALE or mortality, while the rates of MALE alone
were comparable to surgery, all of which were consistent with
the findings of the overall analysis (Supplementary material online,
Table S8).
For the subgroup analyses of the presentations with CLTI and claudication, endovascular repair was still associated with higher hazard
rates for the composite of MALE or mortality (CLTI, 58.8% vs. 60.0%,
HR 1.09, 95% CI 1.03-1.16, P = 0.002; claudication, 32.8% vs. 32.1%,
HR 1.11, 95% CI 1.06-1.16, P < 0.001) and mortality alone (CLTI,
45.8% vs. 46.7%, HR 1.09, 95% CI 1.02-1.16, P = 0.008; claudication,
23.3% vs. 22.1%, HR 1.16, 95% CI 1.09-1.23, P < 0.001), but with no
significant difference in MALE (CLTI, 25.4% vs. 25.7%, HR 1.05, 95%
CI 0.96-1.14, P = 0.27; claudication, 13.9% vs. 14.4% HR 1.01, 95% CI
0.93-1.08, P = 0.89) (Tables 3 and 4, and Supplementary material online, Figures S4 and S5).
Endovascular revascularization was associated with a greater number of less-severe limb events (CLTI, 77.9% vs. 75.4%, HR 1.16, 95%
CI 1.11-1.22, P < 0.001; claudication, 74.3% vs. 71.7%, HR 1.14, 95%
CI 1.10-1.18, P < 0.001), with no significant differences in major
bleeding (10.8% vs. 11.2%, HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.90-1.17, P = 0.70; 7.7%
vs. 8.6%, HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.87-1.05, P = 0.35) or all-cause urgent
rehospitalization (61.1% vs. 63.6%, HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.98-1.09,
P = 0.21; 49.1% vs. 52.9%, HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.93-1.01, P = 0.14) for
CLTI and claudication presentations.

insertion for coronary disease40 extends to the PAD setting.
Therefore, a wide range of clinical practices is possible. The prolonged prescription of dual antiplatelet therapy after endovascular
revascularization, where drug-coated technology is increasingly utilized,5 could increase the risk of bleeding over time and offset a lower
likelihood of perioperative complications than surgery. Likewise,
these medical treatment differences would influence the primary outcome by way of fatal bleeding, major adverse cardiovascular events,
and MALE.37
Our study has some caveats worth noting. This was a retrospective evaluation of administrative data, which has the potential for coding and data entry inaccuracies. While propensity score matching was
performed, the possibility of unmeasured confounders cannot be
excluded. As described, clinical information on lower-limb disease
relating to anatomical and lesion characteristics, smoking, and medication use was unavailable. Additionally, while we matched for prior
peripheral vascular disease and intervention, we may not fully account for the frequency or extent of prior peripheral artery revascularizations. It is uncertain how these factors affected patient selection,
where the endovascular approach was overwhelmingly preferred. In
addition to patient selection, our study did not evaluate the deployment rates of paclitaxel-coated devices to conclude about these.
Despite these limitations, there is evidence that broader details of
demographics and medical comorbidities can correlate with patterns
of vascular disease.14,41 Also, the goals and strategies for treating
intermittent claudication and CLTI differ,36 and so the subgroup analyses of these presentations help further distinguish between the
types of PAD. Given the limited information regarding anatomical
and lesion characteristics, or the revascularization side, adverse
events might not have occurred at the same index lesion site.
However, we anticipate that these matched endovascular and surgery groups would experience similar lower-limb morbidity, including
MALE, at sites unrelated to the initial revascularization. The literature
suggests management of PAD, including the use of surgical and endovascular intervention, may vary among countries and limit the generalizability of our results to other populations.42 This study compared
revascularization outcomes by focusing on MALE, mortality, and
other less-severe adverse events. Some results, including quality of
life and walking impairment, were not captured. There are upcoming
randomized clinical trials that will compare endovascular and surgical
revascularization by evaluating various clinical endpoints, and these
will be less affected by confounding.43,44 Nevertheless, our data's
strength is in the heterogeneity of the study population, as this is likely to reflect current real-world practice better than clinical trials
where participation is subject to recruitment and eligibility.

Conclusion
Although endovascular and surgical revascularization had comparable
long-term risks of MALE, surgery was associated with a lower combined rate of MALE and mortality, which is at odds with prior observations and highlights ongoing contention in this field. There is a need
for carefully conducted, randomized clinical trials to clarify the relative merits of these two strategies.

However, it is important to note that our subgroup analysis showed
a mortality benefit for surgery with both clinical presentations.
Several potential mechanisms could explain the excess mortality
associated with endovascular therapy. Some literature points to excess mortality associated with paclitaxel-coated balloons and stents.
Deployment of these devices for the endovascular treatment of femoropopliteal artery disease has been linked to increased all-cause patient mortality in clinical trials.33 However, these findings are
contentious as this association was not confirmed in other studies.34,35 Secondly, all patients receiving PAD interventions are
expected to have serial clinical evaluation and imaging surveillance.36
The rationale for post-procedural surveillance is to detect restenoses
early, so this can be treated electively and with a less complicated
procedure than if this were to advance. Any variations in the surveillance programmes and approaches to surgically and endovascularly
treated patients could drive a discrepancy in the urgency or frequency of reintervention and mortality. Similarly, we did not account
for medication use and cardiovascular risk factor control, which
could have important associations with myocardial infarction, stroke,
MALE, and mortality. The optimal medical management of PAD can
include prescription of antiplatelets, statins, angiotensin-converting
enzyme inhibitors (or angiotensin II receptor blockers), as well as
smoking abstinence and control of hypertension, dyslipidaemia, and
diabetes mellitus.37 Possible medical management discrepancies
among surgically and endovascularly treated patients, which we could
not account for, might cause residual confounding and explain the
mortality differences. Lastly, unmeasured confounders could influence patient selection for a revascularization approach, especially as
endovascular repair was more popular than surgery. In particular, we
did not have access to reliable information about anatomical or lesion
characteristics that may have meant that patients were not amenable
to surgery, and therefore, could only be intervened upon endovascularly. Patient selection can be dictated by the type of lesion, the segment of disease, and the suitability of the saphenous vein for
grafting.2,3 Tsai et al.32 attempted to adjust for some of these variables, albeit with fewer patients. The extent to which these factors
could have influenced our results is not clear. Still, it does not seem
intuitive that patient selection of surgical PAD patients would be
associated with less atherosclerotic burden to explain the lower
mortality. Rather, it might be expected that surgical revascularization
would be reserved for cases of more severe atherosclerotic disease,
but it is difficult to firmly conclude about these selection practices.
Our findings should also be interpreted in the context of our longer follow-up period. Shorter PAD studies have reported higher
rates of perioperative bleeding and urgent rehospitalization for individuals receiving open surgery than endovascular intervention.30,32
The long-term rates for these adverse events were similar in our surgery and endovascular groups, which may have been impacted by unmeasured factors in the years following these procedures, such as
the type and duration of antithrombotic therapy. Open surgery
would be expected to have a higher incidence of perioperative bleeding. Limited studies suggest dual antiplatelet therapy is potentially
associated with improved surgical bypass graft38 and stent patency,39
at the expense of a higher bleeding rate. There is no consensus
regarding the duration, or indeed the efficacy of dual antiplatelet therapy following PAD revascularization.7 It remains to be seen whether
the evidence for dual antiplatelet therapy after drug-eluting stent
