Aims

Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is an accelerated ageing syndrome associated with premature vascular disease and death due to heart attack and stroke. In HGPS a mutation in lamin A (progerin) alters nuclear
morphology and gene expression. Current therapy increases the lifespan of these children only modestly. Thus,
greater understanding of the underlying mechanisms of HGPS is required to improve therapy. Endothelial cells
(ECs) differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from these patients exhibit hallmarks of
senescence including replication arrest, increased expression of inflammatory markers, DNA damage, and telomere
erosion. We hypothesized that correction of shortened telomeres may reverse these measures of vascular ageing.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
We generated ECs from iPSCs belonging to children with HGPS and their unaffected parents. Telomerase mRNA
and results
(hTERT) was used to treat HGPS ECs. Endothelial morphology and functions were assessed, as well as proteomic

and transcriptional profiles with attention to inflammatory markers, DNA damage, and EC identity genes. In a
mouse model of HGPS, we assessed the effects of lentiviral transfection of mTERT on measures of senescence,
focusing on the EC phenotype in various organs. hTERT treatment of human HGPS ECs improved replicative capacity; restored endothelial functions such as nitric oxide generation, acetylated low-density lipoprotein uptake and
angiogenesis; and reduced the elaboration of inflammatory cytokines. In addition, hTERT treatment improved cellular and nuclear morphology, in association with a normalization of the transcriptional profile, effects that may be
mediated in part by a reduction in progerin expression and an increase in sirtuin 1 (SIRT1). Progeria mice treated
with mTERT lentivirus manifested similar improvements, with a reduction in inflammatory and DNA damage
markers and increased SIRT1 in their vasculature and other organs. Furthermore, mTERT therapy increased the
lifespan of HGPS mice.

Conclusion
Vascular rejuvenation using telomerase mRNA is a promising approach for progeria and other age-related diseases.

Ageing

Translational Perspective
Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a paediatric genetic disease that results in accelerated senescence, with 90% of
patients succumbing to cardiovascular disease in their mid-teens. Treatments addressing the ageing disorder and significant cardiovascular pathology remain limited; however, there is significant promise in using mRNA therapeutics to target the abnormalities. This study
presents the treatment of HGPS using mRNA human telomerase reverse transcriptase to reverse senescence in an in vitro induced
pluripotent stem cell model of Progeria and extend lifespan in a Progeria mouse model. This work presents a new approach for
improving vascular senescence and outcomes for patients.

Introduction
Chronological age is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease.1
Vascular ageing is characterized by an impairment of endothelial
homeostasis, with reduced generation of nitric oxide (NO),
increased production of oxygen-derived free radicals and expression
of adhesion molecules,2 predisposition to vascular inflammation,
platelet adhesion, and progression of vascular disease. Vascular ageing
is accelerated in Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS).3,4
HGPS is caused by a de novo mutation in the lamin A gene (LMNA)
located on chromosome 1 (c.1824C>T, G608G).5,6 The LMNA mutation results in a truncated form of lamin A, termed progerin that
lacks the post-translational processing splice site. As a result, progerin
remains permanently farnesylated, accumulates in the nuclear envelope, and alters nuclear morphology.7-11

Progerin accumulation is associated with many of the cellular alterations associated with ageing including DNA damage, global gene expression changes,12 and telomere erosion.13,14 Notably, progerin
also accumulates to a lesser degree in all individuals due to mRNA
mis-splicing and may contribute to ageing.15 Telomere erosion and
replicative arrest are key hallmarks of senescence,3,16,17 both of
which are observed in HGPS cells.8 Telomeres are susceptible to
DNA damage,18 and the resulting DNA damage response induces inflammatory gene expression19 and a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP).20 SASP paracrine factors have been shown
to induce senescence in neighbouring cells and are a component of
age-related diseases.21
Children with HGPS manifest failure to thrive at an early age, and
in childhood may present with osteopenia, alopecia, scleroderma, lipodystrophy, and cardiovascular symptoms.22-27 Most individuals

Materials and methods
Maintenance of human induced pluripotent
stem cell
Human iPSC lines (HGFDFN168 iPSC1P, HGADFN167 iPSC 1Q,
HGDFN003 iPSC 1C, HGMDFN090 iPSC 1B) were purchased from the
Progeria Research Foundation Cell and Tissue Bank and were cultured
and maintained on Matrigel (BD Biosciences)-coated plates (Corning) in
mTeSR plus medium (STEMCELL Technologies) according to protocol.
The iPSCs were passaged upon 70% confluency and maintained in
humidified incubators at 37 C and 5% CO2 (Thermo Scientific).

Differentiation of endothelial cells from
induced pluripotent stem cell
Human iPSCs were differentiated to EC using our established protocol.33
In brief, the iPSCs were grown to 80% confluence, and incubated with
DMEM/F12 (Gibco), supplemented with Wnt agonist CHIR 99021 (5 mM,
Selleck), bone morphogenetic protein-4 (BMP4, 25 ng/m, Peprotech),
B27 supplement (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and N2 supplement (Thermo
Fisher Scientific). At Day 3, cells were dissociated (TrypLE, Gibco) and
plated to 20% confluency in StemPro media supplemented with forskolin
(5 mM, LC Laboratories), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF,
50 ng/mL, Peprotech), and polyvinyl alcohol (2 mg/mL, Sigma). After
7 days, cells were cultured in endothelial growth media (EGM-2MV,
Lonza) for maturation. At Days 11 and 12, cells were collected and
sorted by Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) using two

antibodies specific to ECs (Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated CD31 antibody
or PE-conjugated CD144 antibody, BD Pharminogen).

Nitric oxide production and Dil-Ac-LDL uptake assays
ECs were stained with DAF-FM DA (Invitrogen) to assess intracellular
NO. Cultured ECs were incubated with DAF-FM DA for 30 min, washed,
and fluorescence measured with ImageJ and plotted as mean of the fluorescent signal (integrated density) in each cell. For assessing acetylated
low-density lipoprotein (Ac-LDL) uptake, ECs were incubated with acLDL-594 (Invitrogen) at 1:200 dilutions for 5 h and, then, the fluorescent
signal was measured.

Angiogenesis assay (vascular network
formation)
Vascular network formation assays were carried out as we have
described.45,46 ECs from all three groups were seeded in growth factor
reduced Matrigel and EGM2-MV medium at 40 000 cells per well in 12well plates. The number of network segments was measured after 8 h in
five random microscopic fields in three experiments.

Real-time endothelial cell proliferation assay
Proliferation assay were carried out using the xCELLigence instrument
(Roche) which was placed in a humidified incubator at 37 C and 5% CO2.
ECs from all three groups (3000-5000) were seeded into the wells with
medium in triplicate. The impedance value of each well was monitored
every minute in the first 4 h, and every hour for 120 h. The data are
expressed as a cell index (CI) value.

Telomere length measurement by
monochrome multiplex PCR
Cellular DNA was isolated, and monochrome multiplex PCR (MMqPCR)
was performed in accordance with a previously published protocol by
Cawthon.47 Samples and standards were pipetted into PCR tubes; the
standard was created via two-fold serial dilution. The PCR master mix
was added to each PCR tube and was transferred to a white LightCyclerV
480 Multiwell plate (384 wells). PCR runs were performed on a Roche
LightCyclerV 480 (Software: 1.5.1.62) using a preinstalled MMqPCR
protocol. Raw data were preprocessed via a Python 2.0 script to differentiate different primers for the telg/telc primers and single-copy gene
(SCG) primer (human b-globin). Data were reported as the ratio of telomere concentration to SCG concentration (T/S ratio).

Telomerase activity assay was performed following the TRAPezeV
Telomerase Detection Kit (SIGMA-MILLIPORE # S7700) protocol with
some modifications. Each cell pellet (106 cells) was washed twice with 1
PBS and resuspended in 20 mL of 1 CHAPS buffer supplemented with
Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche) and RNasein Inhibitor Plus (Promega
# N2615) and incubated for 30 min on ice. After lysis was complete, suspensions were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm, for 20 min at 4 C and lysates
were stored at -80 C. Protein concentration was measured using DC
Protein assay from Bio-Rad and a working dilution for the assay was prepared at 0.03 mg/mL. PCR was performed using provided reagents in
the kit and Hot Start Taq Polymerase from NEB (# M0495L) in a final reaction volume of 50 mL. After a 30-min incubation at 30 C for
telomerase-mediated extension of the TS primer, and 2 min at 95 C to
activate polymerase, the elongated reaction mixture was amplified by
PCR through 35 cycles of 94 C for 15 s, 59 C for 30 s, and 72 C for
1 min. PCR products containing loading dye were electrophoresed in a

succumb to myocardial infarction or stroke due to accelerated atherosclerosis in their mid-teens.28 In a clinical trial, treatment with a
farnesyltransferase inhibitor resulted in a modest extension of life
span by 1-2 years.29,30 Greater understanding of HGPS is needed to
develop more effective therapies.
The effect of HGPS on endothelial cells (ECs) and their modulation of neighbouring vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) is relatively unexplored. Two studies have reported significant EC
pathology in progeria mouse models,31,32 reporting poor shear sensing and strong inflammation. Additionally, we reported a profound
impairment of endothelial functions in HGPS induced pluripotent
stem cell (iPSC)-derived ECs.33 Given the primacy of the endothelium in vascular homeostasis,34 we hypothesized that targeting the
causes of senescence in HGPS ECs would be a promising therapeutic
avenue for HGPS. The ribonucleoprotein telomerase maintains telomere length.35-37 We have previously shown that transient delivery
of modified mRNA encoding human telomerase (hTERT) in aged
human cells can extend telomere length, reverse features of senescence and restore replicative capacity.38-40 Similarly, telomerase
gene therapy has been shown to augment myocardial regeneration
and revascularization by rejuvenating ageing stem cells.41-43 Here, we
show that hTERT treatment of HGPS ECs extends telomere length,
restores endothelial function and gene expression, increases sirtuin 1
(SIRT1) expression, reduces markers of DNA damage, and reverses
adverse paracrine effects on VSMCs. Furthermore, we show that
mTERT therapy in a mouse model of HGPS44 reverses endothelial
activation, reduces endothelial DNA damage, and extends lifespan.
Our work suggests a novel approach for age-related vascular
diseases.

precast gradient polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad # 5671085) for 90 min at
120 V. Gel was then stained for 30 min with GelRed (Biotium # 41003)
followed by washing for 15 min with water. To estimate telomerase activity, non-HGPS and HGPS iPS cells were used as positive control as well
as heat-killing a sample aliquot at 90 C for 10 min for negative controls
along with CHAPS buffer. For mouse liver tissue samples, protocol was
optimized by increasing temperature of TS extension from 30 to 40 C
and increasing number of cycles to 40.

Quantitative fluorescent in situ hybridization (qFISH) experiments were
carried out based on an established protocol.48 Briefly, cells were
arrested in metaphase using colcemid (Roche). Cells were collected into
a tube and, while vortexing, 4 mL of 37 C hypotonic solution (50 mM
KCl, Sigma-Aldrich) was added drop-wise. Cells were fixed with 3:1 ethanol/acetic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) while vortexing. The cells were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min and dropped onto a glass slide. The spreads
were then fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde and dehydrated with an ethanol
series: 5 min in 70%, 85%, and 100%, then air dried at room temperature.
The telomere probe (PNA Bio F1013 TelC-Alexa 647) was diluted 1:40
in HB buffer (600 mL formamide, 10 mL 2M Tris 7.5, 10 mL 10 mg/mL
Salmon sperm, Invitrogen) at 85 C. The probe was then added to the
slide and incubated over night at 4 C. Slides were then washed twice
with 70% formamide in (Tris 20 mM pH 7.5) and BSA 1%, twice with Tris
50 mM, pH 7.5, NaCl 150 mM, and Tween-20 0.05% (Sigma-Aldrich), and
finally dehydrated with ethanol. After, 10 mL of SlowFade Diamond antifade mounting solution with 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was
added and coverslip was applied. Telomere length was reported as the
probe signal normalized to the DAPI signal on >25 metaphase spreads.

Synthesis of messenger RNA
The mRNA was synthesized by in vitro transcription (IVT) with pseudouridine and 5-methylcytidine added to the nucleotide mix so as to increase stability in the mRNA construct that was generated. The DNA
plasmids used in IVT encoded for hTERT or for a catalytically inactive
hTERT form. The open reading frame is human TERT transcript variant 1
(NM_198253.2) and the CI TERT has a point mutation, D712A.38 The
mRNA was purified by high-performance liquid chromatography to remove abortive transcripts and RNA-DNA template hybrids. The size and
integrity of mRNA constructs were assessed using a bioanalyzer.

Cell treatment with hTERT mRNA
HGPS or non-HGPS iPSC-derived ECs, at 70-75% confluence, were
transfected with mRNA using Lipofectamine RNAiMax in Opti-MEM
(Life Technologies) at 1 lg/mL for 4 h, after which cells were replenished
with fresh medium. We also have used Lonza electroporation equipment
(Lonza 4D Nucleofector) for transfection. In this process, 2-3  105 cells
were used in suspension with buffer P3 (Lonza) as recommended by
company and then transfected with 1 lg mRNA. Two transfections were
performed within 48 h, and then, cells were used for further experiments
after 72 h post-transfection.

Confocal imaging
Imaging was performed using a FLUOVIEW FV3000 confocal microscope
(Olympus Corporation). Analysis was performed using the associated
software, cellSens (Olympus Corporation). Raw fluorescent values
extracted for measurements were normalized using either DAPI fluorescence, nuclear area, or cellular area as appropriate for the application.

RTqPCR gene analysis
RNA was extracted from cell pellets or tissues using a Zymo Research
extraction kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA was synthesized from the RNA using a 5x iSCript Reverse Transcriptase
Supermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.). cDNA was diluted 1:10 with
nuclease-free water to 200 mL. For each qPCR reaction, a volume of
20 mL was used: 10 mL of Power SYBRV Green Master Mix (Applied
Biosystems, Thermo Fisher Scientific), 7 mL of nuclease-free water, 1 mL
of the gene specific primer, and 2 mL of the prepared sample cDNA.
Primers used were lamin A and progerin (custom49), GAPDH, SIRT1
(Bio-Rad). RTqPCR was performed using a QuantStudio 12K Flex
(Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies): 96-Fast Well Plate 0.1 mL,
Relative Quantification (-DDCt), SYBRV Green Reporter, and Standard
Run Time. Results are reported as fold-change from the control sample.

Atomic force microscope
Atomic force microscope (AFM) used in the experiment is a Catalyst
Biomicroscope (Bruker). Imaging process was under a contact mode in liquid in room temperature (22 C). AFM probes used in the experiment
were MLCT probes (Bruker Nano). The AFM probe average spring constant was at 0.01 N/m.
A 60-mm dish with cultured cells was mounted on the AFM scanning
stage for imaging. Three millilitres of PBS solution was in the dish during
imaging process. The AFM scanning frequency was 1 Hz. Image data analysis and processing were conducted in a Nanoscope Analysis 1.50r1
(Bruker).

RNA sequencing and bioinformatics analysis
Cultured cells were collected from all three groups. RNA was isolated
using the QIAGEN RNeasy purification kit, and the RNA integrity was
verified with an Agilent 2100(RIN). Total RNA was sent to the Beijing
Genomics Institute (BGI America, Cambridge, MA, USA) for library preparation and sequencing. Poly(A)-selected RNA libraries were prepared
using the TruSeq technology (TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit v2), and
resulting libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeqTM 4000 using
100-bp paired-end reads. Reads were aligned to the reference human
genome (build hg19) using Tophat version 2.1.0.50 The fragment per kilobase per million reads (FPKM) for each gene and differentially-expressed
genes were called by Cuffdiff, version 2.2.10.50 The cut-off of P-value
<_0.05 and absolute values of log2-transformed fold changes larger than 1
were used for differential expression analysis. The heatmaps were created using the pheatmap R package, version 1.0.12 (https://rdrr.io/cran/
pheatmap/). The read coverage, viewed through the Integrative
Genomics Viewer (IGV version 2.3.98).51,52 Pathway enrichment analysis
was carried out by using Metascape version 3.5, P-value (0.01) was used
as cut-off.53 All the raw sequence data for the samples used in this study
are available on the National Center for Biotechnology Information
Sequence Read Archive database: Bioproject PRJNA730422.

Differentiation of vascular smooth muscle
cells
VSMC differentiation was carried out based on an established protocol.54
Briefly, iPSCs were scraped from the culture dish after incubation with
collagenase (Stemcell). Cells were collected into 15 mL conical tube and
centrifuged. Supernatant was aspirated and E6 media containing 10% FBS
and 1/1000 dilution of ROC inhibitor were added and plated on lowcluster plates. The next day, the media were replaced with E6 th 10% FBS.
Media were changed every other day to let the embryoid body (EB) form
and grow in E6 th 10% FBS for 7-10 days. EBs were then plated onto
gelatin-coated 6-well plates in E6 media th10% FBS for 3-5 days. 1 mL of

E6 media was used to break up cell clumps. After this step, cells were
spun down at 1000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was aspirated and
SMGS media was used for resuspension. The cells were then seeded
onto matrigel-coated 6-well plates to grow VSMCs.

Coculture experiments with vascular
smooth muscle cells

Immunofluorescent staining of en face
aortae, aortic rings, lung endothelial cells
and liver sections
Liver and aorta tissues were treated with 30% sucrose (Sigma) overnight,
OCT embedded, and sectioned to 5-8 mM thickness. Sections were fixed
and permeabilized in acetone (Sigma) for 12 min at 4 C followed by a
PBS rinse and dehydration with an ethanol series at 70%, 80%, and 100%
for 5 min. Following dehydration, sections were blocked for 1 h at room
temperature with 5% BSA/0.1% Tween-20 in 1 Tris-buffered solution.
Tissue was incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 C in a humidified chamber. Primary antibodies included: cH2A.X, SIRT1, and CD31
(Abcam ab81299, Cell Signaling Technologies 20282, and Abcam
ab56299, respectively). The next day, sections were washed with PBS
three times for 10 min, incubated with secondary antibody (anti-rabbit
Alexa-488 and anti-rat Alexa-555, Thermo Fisher) for 1 h at room temperature and then washed with PBS. Samples were mounted in
VectaShield antifade mounting media (Vector Laboratories). A previous
en face protocol was used.55 Briefly, aortae were washed and fixed by
PFA 4% before dissection. Then, the aortae were cleaned carefully and
permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS and incubated in blocking
buffer in 10% normal serum in TBS (Tris-buffered saline with 2.5%
Tween-20) for 1 h at room temperature. Next, the aortae were incubated with the previously mentioned primary antibodies at 4 C overnight. The aortae were washed with TBS buffer twice for 10 min and
incubated in secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Then,
open aortae were mounted face up in VectaShield antifade mounting
media. For human and mouse ECs, cells were washed and fixed by 4%
PFA at room temperature for 10 min. Cells were washed with PBS and
incubated with 5% BSA/0.1% Tween-20 in 1 Tris-buffered solution for
1 h. Cells were incubated with primary antibodies (mentioned above)
over night at 4 C. The day after, cells were washed twice with PBS
10 min and then incubated with the secondary antibody for 1 h room
temperature. They were then washed twice again with PBS and mounted
in VectaShield antifade mounting media. Images were normalized to cell
area for surface markers or DAPI for intracellular expression. cH2A.X is
reported as counted foci or a fluorescent value normalized to DAPI.

Western blot and lysate preparation
The mouse livers were dissected and added to the tube with 1.4-mm ceramic beads (Fisher Scientific, 15-340-153), RIPA buffer (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) and protease inhibitor tablets (Roche) and homogenized for
2 min (Fisherbrand). The lysates were then used in BCA protein assay kit
(Thermo Fisher, No. 23225) to measure total protein. The total protein
amounts of 8-12 lg per sample were used for running into the premade
(Bio-Rad) gel running at 100 V for 1 h. Proteins were then transferred to

nitrocellulose membranes with Bio-Rad transfer system (Trans-Blot
Turbo) and blocked in 1 Quant Clean Western buffer (cat No. R2001)
for 1 h. The blots were then incubated with dilute primary antibody in 5%
BSA, 1 TBS, 0.1% Tween-20 at 4 C with gentle shaking, overnight
(SIRT1: Cell Signaling 2028S, 1:1000; telomerase: NOVUS NB110-89471,
1:2000; progerin: Millipore 05-1231, 1:500; GAPDH: Cell Signaling
D16H11, 1:2000). Membranes were washed for 15 min for three times
using Quant Clean Western buffer. Secondary antibody diluted to 1:2000
secondary lgG-HRP (Kwikquant) in R2001 (Quant) was then added for
1 h at room temperature. Membranes were then washed for 15 min
three times using Clean Western buffer. The membranes were then submerged in 5 diluted Kwikquant digital-ECL mixture for 2 min and
imaged using a Kwikquant imager.

Lentivirus construction
HEK293T cells (ATCC) were cultured and transfected at 80% confluency
with three different plasmids including psPAX2 (Addgene, # 12260),
pMD2.G (Addgene, #12259), and mTERT (Addgene # 36413) or GFP
(Addgene #40123) according to Qiagen Effectene transfection reagent
kit protocol (Qiagen). Viral supernatants were harvested 72 h posttransfection, filtered and concentrated using ultracentrifugation for 2 h at
18 700 rpm 4 C. Virus pellet were re-suspended in PBS and were titrated
using Lenti-X GoStix plus (Takara). The levels of p24 viral capsid protein,
which correlate directly with infectious unit (IFU)/ml, were measured.

Animal strain, husbandry, genotyping, and
lentivirus delivery
All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with institutional
guidelines and approval by IACUC at the Houston Methodist Research
Institute. The HGPS progeria mouse model used, C57BL/6-Tg
(LMNA*G608G) HCIins/J,44 was purchased from Jackson Laboratory
(Stock No : 010667). Genotyping was done using a protocol designed
with Transnetyx Inc. (9110 Cordova Rd. Suite 119, Cordova, TN 38016),
which identified the human copy of mutated lamin-A. The homozygous
HGPS mice had two copies of human mutated lamin A gene. Wild-type
mice had no human copies of the mutated lamin protein, and heterozygous had one copy. Mice were housed with a 12 h light/dark cycle between 06:00 and 18:00 in a temperature-controlled room (25 +/- 1 C).
Water and rodent feed were fed ad libitum. Mice that lost greater than
20% of body weight within one week were monitored by veterinary staff
and were provided with moist food and supportive care. Lentiviral constructs (1010 IFU/mL in 150 mL) carrying either GFP or mouse telomerase
(mTERT) were injected via tail vein at 3 months and 6 months old. A minimum of 18 mice was used in each group (WT, HGPS, and HGPSmTERT).

Animal studies
For the in vivo work, two groups of at least 18 mice in each test group
(WT, HGPS, and mTERT) were used for pathology and survival studies.
For the pathology studies, to match age throughout the groups, if an
HGPS group mouse spontaneously died or if euthanasia was recommended by the veterinarian, mice from the other two groups were
euthanized to provide a similar age-matched set. Each histological study
includes 4-5 mice as specified in the figure caption. In the survival studies,
animals lived until spontaneous death or until the veterinarian recommended euthanasia, each death recorded as an event for survival analysis.
All veterinary recommendations were done blinded. Our CMP veterinarian requested euthanasia of mice based on the standard criteria, including
significant loss of muscle mass and impaired mobility. These criteria are
typically observed in later stages of HGPS. When these signs became pronounced, euthanization was recommended. Group sizes were

Conditioned media was collected after 72 h from non-HGPS, HGPS, and
HGPS hTERT treated ECs. Non-HGPS VSMCs were cultured at 70%
confluency and washed with PBS. Non-HGPS VSMCs were then incubated with conditioned media (CM) from these three groups or fresh EC
media (EGM-2MV) for 48 h. Cells were collected and analysed with
FACS for counting and viability. The non-HGPS VSMCs were also processed and lysed for further analysis with a Bio-Plex assay.

Bio-Plex assay
The concentrations of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors were
analysed using Bioplex ProTM human cytokine standard 27-plex and 21plex panels based on xMAP technology (Bio-Rad Laboratory, Hercules,
CA, USA) according to the manufacturer. ECs from all three groups
were collected (5  105) and lysed using Bio-Rad lysis buffer and then
probed for 48 markers of inflammation. Further, equal numbers of
Control Non-HGPS VSMCs were cultured using fresh media or the CM
from non-HGPS ECs, HGPS ECs, or HGPS-hTERT ECs. After 72 h, NonHGPS VSMCs were counted and then lysed for further analysis using
Bioplex ProTM according to the manufacturer. Briefly, lysed cells were
incubated with magnetic beads conjugated with specific antibodies against
48 markers of inflammation. Beads were washed and were incubated for
1 h with fluorescent secondary antibodies of different colours. Beads
were washed and the plates were read to detect inflammatory markers
using the Bio-Rad detection machine.

ELISA for serum markers
Mouse sVCAM-1/CD106 was quantified in the serum collected from
WT, HGPS, and HGPS th mTERT mice at 7-8 months old using ELISA
(R&D Systems). Test was performed per manufacturer. Briefly, the collected serum was diluted 50 times and was added to the coated plate and
incubated for 3 h at room temperature (22 C). It was washed five times
using the washing buffer, and then, mouse VCAM-1 conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was added and incubated for 1 h. The plate was washed
five times before substrate was added for a 30-min incubation. The reaction was halted using the stopping buffer. The optical density of each well
(triplicate for each serum) was read by microplate reader at 570 nm.
Data were calculated using the standard curve obtained from serial dilution of standard substrate provided by the kit. Mouse C-reactive proteins
(CRP) was quantified using an ELISA kit (Invitrogen) per the manufacturer's instruction. Serum from the same three groups was collected at
7-8 months of age and diluted 100 times. Each sample was added to a
coated 96-well plate and incubated for 3 h at room temperature. Each
sample was then washed four times and the anti-mouse CRP antibody
conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was added and incubated for 1 h.
The plate was then washed 4 times, the substrate was added, and the
plate incubated for 30 min. The reaction was halted by the stopping

buffer, and each optical density (triplicate per serum sample) was read at
450 nm. Data were calculated using the standard curve obtained from
serial dilution of standard substrate provided by the kit.

Data analysis
Results are expressed as mean +/- standard deviation. Groups were tested
for normality using a D'Agostino-Pearson test. If they failed the normality
test, groups were analysed using Kruskal-Wallis with post hoc Dunn test.
Otherwise, statistical comparisons between two groups or multiple
groups were performed via, respectively, a Student's t-test or ANOVA
with post hoc Tukey's test using PRISM 7 software. A P-value of <0.05 was
considered significant. Data visualization was performed using Matplotlib
and Seaborn packages in Python 3.7.56 N = 4-6 mice were examined in
each group for pathology studies. N = 18 mice were used for survival analysis performed using PRISM 7 using a log-rank test; dotted lines show
95% confidence interval.

Results
hTERT treatment extends telomere
length, restores replicative capacity, and
improves function in Hutchinson-Gilford
progeria syndrome endothelial cells
To first understand whether hTERT treatment would restore telomere length and replicative capacity, we transfected our iPSCderived ECs (Supplementary material online, Figure S1A and B) with
hTERT mRNA (1 mg hTERT mRNA/3  105 cells 2 over 48 h). Our
initial studies using MMqPCR (Supplementary material online, Figure
S1C) indicated that hTERT treatment extended telomeres, an observation that was confirmed compellingly by qFISH (Figure 1A and B).
Treatment with hTERT mRNA reduced b-gal expression in HGPS
ECs (Supplementary material online, Figure S1D and E). Furthermore,
mRNA hTERT increased replicative capacity in a dose-dependent
manner as assessed by real-time impedance studies (xCelligence;
Figure 1C and Supplementary material online, Figure S1F and G).
Notably, viral treatment of telomerase (to mimic the following in vivo
studies) also improved HGPS iPSC EC proliferation, whereas the viral
vehicle alone impaired cell proliferation (Supplementary material online, Figure S1H). Next, we determined whether hTERT treatment
restores EC-specific functionality. Treatment with hTERT mRNA
improved network formation in Matrigel (Figure 2A and B), improved
uptake of acetylated LDL (ac-LDL) (Figure 2C), and improved NO
generation (Figure 2D). Thus, hTERT treatment reversed telomere
erosion and replicative decline and normalized EC function in HGPS
cells.

hTERT treatment rescues cellular and
nuclear morphology
HGPS cells possess typical morphological features of senescence,4
including nuclear blebbing.9,57 As typical of senescent cells, HGPS
ECs were more circular and had a greater two-dimensional surface
area. By contrast, the morphology of treated HGPS ECs was
improved, becoming more elongated with a smaller two-dimensional
total surface area as quantified by CI values (Figure 3A-D). These
observations were augmented using atomic force microscopy. While
geometric changes are often markedly heterogeneous in ageing, in a

Mice were euthanized using anesthesia (Isoflurane) and ribs excised to
expose an opening to the thoracic cavity. A 27-G needle (MACS) was
inserted in the right ventricle to perfuse PBS through the pulmonary circulation until the lung was white. The lung was then immediately dissected and stored in PBS on ice. The lungs were further processed for EC
isolation using the OCTOMACS dissociation system. Briefly, lungs were
placed into gentleMACS C-tubes containing a tissue dissociation enzyme
(MiltenyiBiotec: catalog no. 130-095-927). Lung samples were incubated
for 30 min on the gentleMACS OCTO Dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec catalog no. 130-096-427) using protocol program 37C_m_LDK_1 with heaters on to obtain a single cell suspension. The cell suspension was
collected and positive selection for ECs was carried out using MACS
magnetic separation beads conjugated with CD31 and CD144 antibodies.
Following separation, cells were then enriched and analysed by FACS.
Following EC isolation, cells were grown in media supplemented with
MH1015 at 15 mg/mL (home-made) on gelatin-coated plates and incubated at 37 C and 5% CO2.

broad sense they display volume expansion and a 'flat' morphology.58
AFM revealed that our HGPS ECs have a lower height profile by
comparison to non-HGPS ECs (Supplementary material online,
Figure S1I), although hTERT therapy did not appreciably alter this parameter. Treatment with hTERT tended to reduce progerin expression (Figure 3E and Supplementary material online, Figure S1B). We
were surprised to observe that hTERT treatment normalized the nuclear architecture (Figure 3F), reducing the fractional number of
HGPS EC nuclei with blebs. Thus, hTERT treatment can reverse
changes in cellular and nuclear morphology observed with HGPS.

we analysed which of these dysregulated genes were returned to
baseline by hTERT treatment, finding that 265 genes were fully rescued by hTERT (Figure 4B and Supplementary material online, Figure
S2A) and several others were partially rescued (Supplementary material online, Figure S2B). Figure 4C illustrates the process for finding
rescued genes in the genome browser. Treatment with hTERT also
normalized the expression of EC identity genes59 and several ECrelated pathways that were disturbed in HGPS (Figure 4D and
Supplementary material online, Figure S2C). GO analysis revealed
other pathways rescued by hTERT including, most prominently,
DNA damage/repair and fiber/structural organization (Figure 4E and
Supplementary material online, Figure S2D). In addition, we observed
that in HGPS there was an up-regulation of genes associated with
endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT; Periostin, Snail,
TGF-b). The increase in EndoMT gene expression was reversed by
hTERT treatment. Altogether, hTERT treatment had an extensive

effect on gene expression, fully normalizing 265 genes and partially
rescuing additional genes related to EC identity, cytoskeletal structure, and DNA damage.

hTERT treatment attenuates expression
and release of inflammatory cytokines
In patients with HGPS, there may be medial atrophy, presumably due
to loss of VSMCs in the vessel wall.60 We speculated that the loss of
VSMCs is mediated in part by an SASP in HGPS ECs. It is known that
a cell expressing SASP may cause dysfunction and even apoptosis of
neighbouring cells.21 Thus, we sought to establish a connection between SASP in ECs and impaired proliferation and/or apoptosis in
VSMCs. First, we characterized the SASP secretome in HGPS ECs.
We observed that HGPS ECs express a panoply of inflammatory
cytokines consistent with the complex SASP profile61 (Figure 5A).
Intriguingly, the expression of 35 proteins (73% of the inflammatory
cytokines that were increased in HGPS) was attenuated by hTERT
treatment (Figure 5A). Subsequently, we assessed the effects of CM

.. from HGPS ECs on normal VSMCs. We observed that HGPS EC
..
.. CM significantly reduced VSMC proliferation. By contrast, CM from

reduced. SIRT1 is implicated in histone deacetylation,62 telomere
maintenance,63 and reduces DNA damage signaling at telomeres.64
Treatment with hTERT mRNA reversed these abnormalities in
HGPS ECs. Immunofluorescent staining further confirmed our results
(Figure 6A and B). The nuclear expression and co-localization of
cH2A.X and 53BP1 were increased in HGPS ECs, an effect reversed
by treatment with hTERT (Figure 6C-E). In addition, SIRT1 nuclear
expression was reduced in HGPS ECs and rescued by hTERT treatment (Figure 6F). RTqPCR analysis revealed a strong decrease in
SIRT1 expression in HGPS ECs (Figure 6G). Furthermore, colocalization of SIRT1 and the telomere were reduced in HGPS ECs, an effect
that was reversed by hTERT treatment (Figure 6G). These data suggest that parallel to progerin reduction, the benefit of hTERT treatment may be mediated in part by the role of SIRT1 in maintaining
telomere length and reducing DNA damage response.

(LMNA*G608G). The model has been characterized and recapitulates some features of the human progeria syndrome.46 Progeroid
mice exhibit failure to grow after 3 months and have loss of their subcutaneous fat layer and decreased bone density. Although they develop attenuation of the media of the large vessels, unlike human
patients they do not develop intimal occlusive disease and instead die
of cachexia and inanition.46
Because murine telomeres are much longer than humans (40-100
vs, 8-15 kb) one might reasonably think that telomere erosion would
not be a significant issue in mice and that mTERT treatment would
likely have little effect. Nevertheless, because the murine model is accessible commercially and we could at least test the potential benefits
of telomerase treatment in this model, we generated a lentiviral vector which encoded mouse TERT (mTERT). Subsequently, HGPS
mice were treated with tail vein injection of mTERT or GFP (1010
IFU/mL in 150 mL PBS) or vehicle alone at 3 and 6 months of age.
Notably, we observed that in this HGPS mouse model, aortic
VCAM-1 expression is elevated even at 3 months of age
(Supplementary material online, Figure S3A), which suggests intervention at an earlier timepoint may have greater benefit. Necropsy studies performed by an independent veterinarian blinded to the

Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome endothelial cells are shown in (A) (scale bar-200 mm). Nuclear lamin A staining is shown in (B) (scale bar:

cells across three replicates, D). Cell shape index/circularity is defined as 4p(area/perimeter2). hTERT therapy additionally induced a downward trend
in progerin expression as assessed via RTqPCR (n = 6) (E) and improves nuclear morphology (F), reducing the number of folded nuclei (three experimental replicates, percent folded nuclei reported for at least 300 cells in each group per replicate). Data were quantified using a one-way ANOVA

progeria syndrome endothelial cells (significance cut-off of P = 0.05 for fold-change >_1 up or down, A). To further elucidate how hTERT therapy
affects global gene expression, genes differentially regulated between non-Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome endothelial cells and HutchinsonGilford progeria syndrome endothelial cells were then analysed again to assess whether hTERT therapy returned the gene expression to the nonHutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome endothelial cell baseline. This analysis is visualized via heatmap in (B) with a significance cut-off of P = 0.05,
with example genome browser data showing how the process was conducted for individual, representative genes (C). A total of 256 genes in total
were defined as 'rescued' via this analysis (see Supplementary material online, Figure S2A), with highly significant pathways identified relating to cellular
cytoskeletal organization and motility, DNA damage and repair pathways, and transcription factor binding and regulation. Endothelial cell specific
pathways are listed in (D) by rank order significance and (E) shows genes affected related to DNA repair. GO pathways, genes, and the P-values for
endothelial specific and non-specific pathways altered by hTERT therapy are detailed in Supplementary material online, Figure S2. Pathway analysis for
(D) and (E) were conducted on six biological replicate groups. Non-Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome and Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome endothelial cell lines were differentiated from a parent/child donor set.

Treatment of Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome endothelial cells with hTERT reduces the senescence-associated secretory phenotype profile
as measured by Bio-Plex analysis (A). To assess how these secreted factors may negatively affect other relevant vascular cells, a conditioned media experiment was set up using non-Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome vascular smooth muscle cells differentiated from the control donor as detailed
in (B). To confirm differentiation, vascular smooth muscle cells were stained for smooth muscle cell specific markers smoothelin and a-actin 2
(ACTA2, scale bar-25 mm). When these control vascular smooth muscle cells were subject to the various conditioned media, their proliferation
was greatly reduced when cultured under the Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome endothelial cell conditioned media, but proliferation was not
affected when Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome endothelial cells treated with hTERT supplied the conditioned media (n = 3, C, scale bar-
50 mm). Bio-Plex analysis of vascular smooth muscle cells exposed to different conditioned media demonstrated that vascular smooth muscle cells
themselves also secreted more inflammatory markers when cultured under Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome endothelial cell donor media,
though this shift was attenuated when hTERT treated Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome endothelial cells were the donor (D). Fold-change vascular smooth muscle cell count is the endpoint cell count of each group divided by its respective initial seeding cell count. Analysis of (C) was tested
using a one-way ANOVA with post hoc Tukey's test for group differences. Significance was taken at P < 0.05, in (C) only significant changes between
groups are annotated, all other between-group statistics did not reach significance. All error bars show standard deviation.

experimental groups revealed no gross or microscopic pathological
findings of mTERT treatment on the 33 organs examined (see
Supplementary material online). To determine if mTERT treatment
had an effect on vascular senescence as assessed by inflammatory
markers, animals were sacrificed and aortae harvested 2 months
post-second dose treatment (at 8 months). The aortae from vehicletreated HGPS mice had significantly elevated VCAM-1 expression, an
endothelial adhesion molecule that is increased with vascular inflammation (Figure 7A and B). By contrast, in mTERT-treated mice,
VCAM-1 expression was attenuated as assessed by analysis of en face
(Figure 7A and B) and cross-sectional vascular sections. In addition, we
used qPCR to assess the expression of key genes involved in EC
homeostasis: VCAM-1, von Willebrand factor (vWF), tissue plasminogen activator (TPA), and thrombomodulin (THBD). Treatment

with viral mTERT reversed the elevated levels of VCAM-1 and vWF
in HGPS aortic ECs (Figure 7C and D). The expression of THBD was
decreased in HGPS aortic ECs, an effect that was not appreciably
reversed by treatment with mTERT. The expression of TPA was minimally modulated across the groups (Supplementary material online,
Figure S3B and C). We additionally examined isolated lung ECs to explore if this effect could be seen in other vascular areas. Treatment of
lung ECs with mTERT increased THBD expression. However, TPA
expression, like with the aortic ECs, was not appreciably modulated
(Supplementary material online, Figure S3D and E). We also observed
improvements in endothelial NO synthase levels in the aortic and
liver endothelium (Supplementary material online, Figure S3K and L).
When we examined serum markers predictive of cardiovascular disease (sVCAM-1 and CRP), we did not observe appreciable changes

Immunofluorescent quantification of these images showed that Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome endothelial cells had significantly elevated levels of nuclear cH2A.X (normalized to nuclear area) which were reduced with hTERT intervention (C). Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome endothelial cells also had
elevated levels of nuclear localized 53BP1 which were reduced upon hTERT treatment (D). Colocalization of the signals cH2A.X and 53BP1 were
increased in Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome cells, and decreased with hTERT treatment (E). Nuclear SIRT1 expression was reduced in
Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome but restored with hTERT treatment (F). RTqPCR analysis showed that Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome endothelial cells have decreased SIRT1 expression, confirmed by IF. Treatment with hTERT induced an upward trend which did not reach significance (G). Colocalization of the signals for SIRT1 and the telomeres were increased upon hTERT treatment (H). For each of the IF experiments,
60 individual cells quantified, replicated at least three times to confirm. Nuclear expression (fluorescence) was normalized to the nuclear area of each
cell. Colocalization values are reported as Mander's coefficients for signal correlation for each individual cell. Statistics for qPCR data was performed
on the ddCt values (G) using ANOVA with post hoc Tukey's test. All IF data were tested for normality using D'Agostino-Pearson. Images (C), (D), and

mTERT treatment enhances SIRT1
expression and reduces DNA damage
signaling in murine Hutchinson-Gilford

We observed increased nuclear expression of the DNA damage response marker cH2A.X in aortic endothelium of HGPS mice. We
performed IF of various mouse tissues to assess DNA damage (Figure

mice, cH2A.X expression in the aortic endothelium was reduced
(Figure 8B). We made similar observations on mouse lung ECs (Figure

We additionally observed increased telomerase activity and telomere
extension via qFISH in the liver tissue endothelium (Supplementary
material online, Figure S5), which was associated with a downregulation of markers of DNA damage. However, in contrast to
human cells, SIRT1 expression in the mouse samples was not clearly
rescued or altered. We performed IF on mouse aortic, lung, and liver
vascular ECs (Supplementary material online, Figure S6). We
observed that SIRT1 was significantly downregulated in aortic tissue
on qPCR analysis and in liver lysates upon WB analysis from HGPS
mice. Our findings are consistent with recently published data showing that telomere erosion is associated with a p53-dependent decline
in sirtuin expression in telomerase knockout mice.65 Treatment with
mTERT tended to normalize SIRT1 expression, but the results did
not achieve statistical significance (d.n.s.).

These changes are quantified in (B), single cell normalized VCAM-1 expression for each of the mouse groups from en face staining of the dissected
aortas (n = 19 cells per aortic section, representative of 4-5 mice per group). Representative aortic cross sections are shown to complement the en
face staining. Results were confirmed using RTqPCR analysis of isolated aortic endothelial cells from 4 to 6 mice from each group, showing increased
VCAM-1 and von Willebrand factor expression that is normalized with mTERT expression (C and D). The data were tested for normality using
D'Agostino-Pearson test. Kruskal-Wallis with post hoc Dunn test was used to quantify the data in (B). Statistics for qPCR data was performed on the
ddCt values using ANOVA with post hoc Tukey's test. Significance was taken at P < 0.05, all between-group statistics are displayed natively. All error

mTERT therapy reduces progerin
expression and extends lifespan in
murine Hutchinson-Gilford progeria
syndrome
Consistent with the observations in our human cell lines, the expression of progerin mRNA in both aorta and lung ECs was increased in
HGPS, and reduced by treatment with mTERT (Figure 9A and B).
Similarly, WB analysis of hepatic tissue lysate revealed that progerin
was increased in HGPS, though only a downward trend was
observed after TERT treatment that did not reach significance (Figure
9C and D). We observed impaired growth and abbreviated lifespan in

HGPS mice as previously reported.46 Two treatments with lentiviral
mTERT increased the lifespan of HGPS mice by 20% (Figure 9E).
Around 27% (5 out of 18) of the untreated HGPS mice died spontaneously. In the mice which died spontaneously, we observed significant
cachexia, impaired mobility, and insufficient food intake, associated
with significant inanition; likely contributors to death. The remaining
animals from the study (both treated and untreated) were euthanized
at the request of the veterinarian due to failure to gain weight, and
other clinical signs associated with progeria (reduced mobility of
joints and spine, with stilted gait and hunched posture, and muscle
wasting). Notably, only one mouse treated with mTERT died spontaneously. Altogether, this section underscores that TERT treatment

All tissues were stained for nuclei (DAPI, blue) and cH2A.X (green). Individual cells from the tissues were quantified (n > 50) for nuclear cH2A.X fluorescence (tissue sections from aorta in B and liver in D) and cH2A.X foci in isolated mouse lung endothelial cells in (C). In the aortic and lung tissue,
differences were not statistically significant, though cH2A.X was significantly downregulated or decreased in the mTERT treatment groups. In liver tissues, Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome vascular cells displayed increased cH2A.X, which was reversed by mTERT. All data collected from four
to five different mice histology sections for each group. The data were tested for normality using D'Agostino-Pearson test. Kruskal-Wallis with post

induces a favourable down-regulation of progerin in mouse cells as it
does in human cells, providing a mechanistic connection between the
treatments observed in vitro and in vivo.

Discussion
The primary cause of morbidity and mortality in HGPS children is
vascular disease. The endothelium is extremely critical to vascular
homeostasis; thus, it seems sensible to consider endotheliumtargeted strategies for these children. In this study, we confirm ECs
derived from HGPS children manifest global abnormalities in form
and function, consistent with a senescent phenotype. Surprisingly,
two treatments with mRNA hTERT are sufficient to increase telomere length, and attenuate or reverse the abnormalities in transcriptional profile, nuclear morphology, and cell functions. Furthermore,
we observed that conditioned medium from HGPS ECs adversely
affected VSMCs, reducing their proliferation and inducing an inflammatory activation, effects that were reversed by treating the HGPS

ECs with hTERT. Thus, medial atrophy might be due in part to senescent ECs in HGPS, an effect that could be reversed by endothelialtargeted therapy (Graphical Abstract).
In HGPS mice, we observed that mTERT treatment improved the
endothelial phenotype, and provided for a 20% increase in lifespan. In
our mouse model of HGPS mice, arterial occlusive disease does not
occur, so coronary and carotid artery disease is not the cause of
death as it is in humans. Nevertheless, a systemic improvement in EC
health was observed in this study with mTERT and would be
expected to provide for improvements in function of the vessels supplying all tissues. An improvement in vascular homeostasis might be
expected to improve organ function and extend lifespan since endothelial function regulates perfusion, thrombosis, inflammation, and
serves as a niche for resident stem cells involved in tissue repair.66,67
Indeed, EC-specific expression of progerin shortens lifespan to the
same degree as systemic expression of progerin.32 In addition,
VSMC-specific progerin expression is also sufficient to induce accelerated development of atherosclerosis and death.68,69 Thus, the clinical picture of significant cardiovascular pathology in HGPS patients

Treatment with mTERT appreciably reduced progerin gene expression in both the aortic and lung endothelium. Liver tissue lysates were analysed
for progerin in (C) and (D) (n = 5 mice); however, while liver tissues displayed a marked up-regulation of progerin expression, mTERT did not significantly down-regulate expression in liver lysates. Overall mouse survival with mTERT treatment is shown in E, with a significant extension of lifespan
(7 weeks) displayed by the mTERT-treated group vs. the Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome group (n = 18 mice per group). Images (A) and (C)
were analysed using a one-way ANOVA with post hoc Tukey's test. Image (B) was analysed using a Kruskal-Wallis with post hoc Dunn test. Statistics
for qPCR data was performed on the ddCt values. Survival in (E) was analysed using a log-rank test, with error densities (dotted lines) shown over

may be tied directly to a compounding of both EC and VSMC-related
dysfunction. In this regard, we speculate that age-related disease may
be due in large part to vascular senescence.
It is possible that earlier intervention is required to have a greater
effect on the outcome. At the time of treatment (3 months) significant alteration in endothelial function as assessed by VCAM-1 expression is present in the aortic endothelium (Supplementary
material online, Figure S3A). This may also explain why specific clinical
markers like sVCAM-1 or CRP were not appreciably altered
(Supplementary material online, Figure S3I and J), as considerable disease progression had already occurred. It is also worth noting that
our mouse model is generated by the expression of two alleles of the
mutant lamin A, whereas in HGPS children, only one allele is
mutated. Even though mouse telomeres are much longer than human
telomeres (40-100 vs. 8-15 kb),70 it appears that telomere erosion
may occur in HGPS mice, a process reversed by exogenous/

constitutive expression of telomerase (Supplementary material online, Figure S5).
In human HGPS cells, hTERT treatment substantially restored several transcriptional profiles. The mechanism by which telomerase
treatment normalizes gene expression requires further elucidation.
There are some paradigms that connect telomere length and gene
expression, such as the positional effect,71,72 or telomere-associated
protein/transcription factor redistribution.73,74 However, these
hypotheses and observations may not uniformly apply to the mechanisms underlying the improvements observed in both human cells
and mice, as the telomere biology of mice differs from that of
humans.75 However, uniformly observed in our work on both human
and murine tissues is the inhibitory effect telomerase expression has
on progerin expression. The mechanism by which telomerase treatment reduces progerin levels is unclear, but a down-regulation of
progerin would explain the global benefit of TERT treatment. In

addition, telomere attrition registers as DNA damage, with persistent
activation causing eventual cellular dysfunction; however, telomerase
can protect against this76-78-our investigation revealed several pathways altered by hTERT treatment related to DNA damage which
was confirmed using immunofluorescence. Lastly, we also observed
SIRT1 depletion and potential rescue in human cells. The relationship
between SIRT1 and TERT regulation is established although not yet
fully elucidated. It is known that telomere dysfunction induces SIRT1
repression.65 Conversely, in specific cell lines overexpression of
SIRT1 can rescue cells from senescence,79-81 though in other scenarios (nutrient sensing) SIRT1 may inhibit TERT expression.82 This is
relevant to our observation in HGPS ECs, as SIRT1 regulates NO,83
FOXO-1,84 and Notch signaling,85 and additionally has a protective
role against metabolic liver disease.86 Overall SIRT1 appears to play a
role indicative of telomere maintenance and homeostasis. Here, we
report as a novel finding that hTERT transfection in human iPSC EC
lines may itself induce SIRT1 expression. The mechanism for this finding and our other findings remains to be elucidated, especially in light
of the different telomere biology between human and murine cells.
Nevertheless, a clear benefit is seen for both. The connection between the two may be the regulation of progerin expression, as this
was observed in both experimental models.
There are several limitations to our work. First, our HGPS mice do
not develop occlusive atherosclerotic disease as do children with
HGPS, and as such the physiology of the mice incompletely represents human disease progression. Second, the telomerase treatment
was not optimized by dose-ranging studies. While there is significant
promise, mRNA telomerase therapy will require optimization and
improved delivery. The in vivo work also has some important qualifications. To begin, lentiviral gene transfection results in genome integration and constitutive expression87 as opposed to the transient
nature of in vivo mRNA delivery. Here, our work is only illustrative
that the presence of TERT alleviates the HGPS phenotype and can
extend lifespan in mice. In addition, lentiviral delivery of mTERT has
safety concerns because genomic integration may induce cellular immortalization and oncogenicity. Our safety studies are preliminary in
nature (gross and microscopic pathology, and blood studies;
Supplementary material online, Figure S7), and additional work is
required to confirm safety. Furthermore, due to the lack of a targeting modality with the lentiviral regimen, the lifespan extension
observed in the HGPS mice may be due in part to non-vascular
effects of mTERT (indeed, we observed improvements in tissues
such as liver lysates).
Other than extending the telomere, there may be other methods
to reverse telomere dysfunction. Progerin induces transcription of
telomeric non-coding RNAs (tncRNAs), which activate the DNA
damage response (DDR).88 The inhibition of tncRNAs by sequencespecific telomeric antisense oligonucleotides prevents full DDR activation and premature cellular senescence in HGPS cells in vitro and
restores skin homeostasis as well as lifespan in a transgenic HGPS
mouse model.88 Notably, our in vitro work used mRNA therapy, and
in future studies, we intend to deliver mRNA TERT using a lipid nanoparticle vehicle.
To conclude, the data herein suggest hTERT therapy as a viable
option for treating vascular disease in HGPS and, potentially, extending lifespan for these patients. Accordingly, based on the promising
