A 67-year-old woman with severe organic tricuspid
regurgitation (TR) (Panel A) and progressive dyspnoea,
peripheral oedema, and fatigue despite optimal medical
treatment was scheduled for tricuspid annuloplasty
with Cardioband device (Edwards Lifesciences, USA)
according to Heart Team recommendations. Device
anchors were implanted in counter-clockwise direction along tricuspid annulus checking catheter position
under fluoroscopy and trans-oesophageal echocardiography before release. Nonetheless, when implanting the 16th anchor, push-and-pull manoeuvre
revealed anchor interference with the guidewire
(safety marker) into the postero-lateral branch (Panel
C). Therefore, the anchor was retracted and coronary
angiography revealed a large haematoma causing
severe extravascular compression (Panel D). As the
patient remained haemodynamically stable, the last
two anchors were implanted and the device was stepwise contracted obtaining a significant downgrading of
TR from severe to trivial (Panel B). Given the persistence of angiographic flow-limiting stenosis, even after
nitroglycerine injection performed to exclude traumatic vasospasm, and the evidence of large extraadventitial haematoma with severe compression of
true lumen at intravascular ultrasound (Panels E and F),
a drug-eluting stent was implanted (Panel G). Finally,
residual minor haematoma in the right coronary artery
bifurcation, non-flow limiting (Panel H), was managed
conservatively with uneventful course. Intravascular
imaging elucidates for the first time that one of the
mechanisms of coronary occlusion associated to
Cardioband annuloplasty procedure is the extrinsic
adventitial damage produced by the anchors that leads
to flow-limiting extra-adventitial haematoma. This represents a previously unknown insight into physiopathology of this complication and could help to outline the most appropriate treatment
for it.
