This Focus Issue on cardiac and vascular surgery contains the metaanalysis 'Sex differences in outcomes after coronary artery
bypass grafting: a pooled analysis of individual patient data'
by Mario Gaudino from Weill Cornell Medicine in New York, USA,
and colleagues.1 Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is the best
therapeutic option in a large subset of patients with severe coronary
artery disease.2-5 The authors note that data suggest that women
have worse outcomes than men after CABG, but results have been
inconsistent across studies. Due to the large differences in baseline
characteristics between sexes, suboptimal risk adjustment due to
low-quality data may be the reason for the observed differences. To
overcome this limitation, they undertook a systematic review and
pooled analysis of high-quality individual patient data from large
CABG trials to compare the adjusted outcomes of women and men.
The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and repeat revascularization [major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE)]. The secondary
outcome was all-cause mortality. Multivariable mixed-effect Cox regression was used. Four trials involving 13 193 patients (10 479 males
th 2714 females) were included. Over 5 years of follow-up, women
had a significantly higher risk of MACCE [adjusted hazard ratio (HR)
1.12; P = 0.004] but similar mortality (adjusted HR 1.03; P = 0.51)
compared with men. Women had a higher incidence of MI (adjusted
HR 1.30; 95% CI 1.11-1.52) and repeat revascularization (adjusted
HR 1.22; 95% CI 1.04-1.43), but not stroke (adjusted HR 1.17; 95%
CI 0.90-1.52). The difference in MACCE between sexes was not significant in patients 75 years and older. The use of off-pump surgery
and multiple arterial grafting did not modify the difference between
sexes (Figure 1).
Gaudino et al. conclude that women have worse outcomes than
men in the first 5 years after CABG. This difference is not significant

in patients aged over 75 years and is not affected by the surgical technique. The article is accompanied by an Editorial by Jolanda Kluin
from Amsterdam University Medical Centers and Sanne Peters from
Utrecht University in the Netherlands.6 The authors note that a fundamental issue underpinning the uncertainties in factors underlying
sex differences in coronary heart disease (CHD) is the persistent
under-representation of women in medical research, including in trials of CHD drugs. Also, even when a sufficient number of women are
included, sex-disaggregated analyses are often not conducted and/or
discussed adequately. Hence, while studies such as those by Gaudino
et al. are essential in closing the evidence gap, concerted efforts are
needed to dismantle the social, behavioural, pathophysiological, and
clinical factors underpinning sex differences in outcomes of CABG
and to translate those into medical education, clinical guidelines, and
clinical practice. This will lead to new mechanistic insights and
improved preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic targets, and will improve health outcomes for women and men, and reduce health
inequalities.
The global burden of peripheral artery disease (PAD) is substantial.7-9 PAD revascularization can be performed by either an endovascular or open surgical approach. In a Clinical Research article
entitled 'Long-term outcomes following endovascular and
surgical revascularization for peripheral artery disease: a
propensity score-matched analysis', Saman Parvar from the
University of Adelaide in Australia, and colleagues note that despite
increasing use of endovascular revascularization, it is still uncertain
which strategy yields better long-term outcomes.10 This retrospective cohort study evaluated patients hospitalized with PAD in
Australia and New Zealand who underwent either endovascular or
surgical revascularization between 2008 and 2015, and compared
procedures using a propensity score-matched analysis. Hybrid interventions were excluded. The primary endpoint was mortality or
major adverse limb events (MALE), defined as a composite endpoint
of acute limb ischaemia, urgent surgical or endovascular reinterven-

tion, or major amputation, up to 8 years post-hospitalization using
time-to-event analyses. A total of 14 339 matched pairs (mean +/- SD
age 71 +/- 12 years, 73% male) with good covariate balance were identified. Endovascular revascularization was associated with an increase
in combined MALE or mortality (HR 1.13; P < 0.001). There was a
similar risk of MALE (HR 1.04; P = 0.15) but higher mortality (HR
1.16; P < 0.001) when endovascular repair was compared with surgery. In subgroup analysis, these findings were consistent for both
claudication and chronic limb-threatening ischaemia presentations.
The authors conclude that although the long-term risk of MALE
was comparable for both approaches, enduring advantages of surgical

revascularization included lower long-term mortality. This is at odds
with some prior PAD studies and highlights contention in this space.
The contribution is accompanied by an Editorial by ChristianAlexander Behrendt from the University Medical Center HamburgEppendorf in Germany.11 Behrendt concludes that the study by
Parvar and colleagues used a robust design to generate important
hypotheses that should be addressed in future studies. Until more
comparative effectiveness data from high-quality trials become available, an open-minded multidisciplinary approach and regular case discussions may help to find a way through inconsistent or missing
evidence.

treatment difference was 1.9% in diabetics (PCI vs. CABG 36.4%
vs. 34.5%, difference 1.9%; P = 0.551). Among insulin-treated
patients, all-cause death at 10 years was numerically higher with
PCI (47.9% vs. 39.6%, difference 8.2%; P = 0.227).
Wang et al. conclude that the treatment effects of PCI vs. CABG
on all-cause death at 10 years in patients with 3VD and/or LMCAD
were similar irrespective of the presence of diabetes. There may,
however, be a survival benefit with CABG in patients with insulintreated diabetes. The association between revascularization strategy
and very long-term ischaemic and safety outcomes for patients with
diabetes needs further investigation in dedicated trials. This manuscript is accompanied by an Editorial by William E. Boden from the
Boston University School of Medicine, Raffaele De Caterina from the
University of Pisa, and David Taggart from Oxford University.19 The
authors conclude that the methodology used by Wang et al. in this
SYNTAX analysis raises several major concerns that seriously challenge their conclusions that 10-year all-cause mortality was not different in diabetic patients treated with either PCI or CABG, and that
diabetes did not discriminate any between-group differences in
mortality.
Finally, in a Clinical Research article entitled 'Cardiovascular
magnetic resonance imaging in suspected cardiac tumour:
a multicentre outcomes study', Chetan Shenoy from the
University of Minnesota and colleagues note that cardiovascular
magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is a key diagnostic tool for
the evaluation of patients with suspected cardiac tumours.20 In this
multicentre study of patients undergoing clinical CMR for suspected
cardiac tumour, CMR diagnoses were assigned as no mass, pseudomass, thrombus, benign tumour, or malignant tumour. A final diagnosis was determined after follow-up using all available data. The
primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. Among 903 patients, the
CMR diagnosis was no mass in 25%, pseudomass in 16%, thrombus in
16%, benign tumour in 17%, and malignant tumour in 23%. Over a
median of 4.9 years, 376 patients died. Compared with the final diagnosis, the CMR diagnosis was accurate in 98.3% of patients. Patients
with CMR diagnoses of pseudomass and benign tumour had similar
mortality to those with no mass, whereas those with malignant tumour (HR 3.31) and thrombus (HR 1.46) had significantly greater
mortality. The CMR diagnosis provided incremental prognostic value
over clinical factors including left ventricular ejection fraction, coronary artery disease, and history of extracardiac malignancy (P < 0.001)
(Figure 2).
The authors conclude that in patients with suspected cardiac tumour, CMR has high diagnostic accuracy. Patients with CMR diagnoses of no mass, pseudomass, and benign tumour have similar longterm mortality. The CMR diagnosis is a powerful independent predictor of mortality incremental to clinical risk factors. This manuscript
is accompanied by an Editorial by Grigorios Korosoglou from GRN
Hospital Weinheim, Germany and colleagues.21 The authors conclude that the study by Shenoy et al. represents a very important step
towards establishing the role of CMR not only for the diagnostic classification but also for the precise risk stratification of patients with
suspected cardiac tumours. Further multicentre studies are now warranted, investigating the specific use of multimodal imaging, including
echocardiography, CMR, cardiac computed tomography, and positron emission tomography for the diagnostic work-up and the risk
stratification of such patients.

Acute aortic dissection (AAD) is frequently a challenging surgical
emergency.12-14 Operability of type A AAD (TAAAD) is currently
based on a non-standardized decision-making process, and it lacks a
disease-specific risk evaluation model that can predict mortality. In a
Clinical Research article entitled 'Determinants of outcomes following surgery for type A acute aortic dissection: the UK
National Adult Cardiac Surgical Audit', Umberto Benedetto
from the University of Bristol in the UK, and colleagues investigated
patient, intra-operative data, surgeon, and centre-related variables
for patients who underwent TAAAD in the UK.15 The authors identified 4203 patients undergoing TAAAD surgery in the UK (2009-
2018), who were enrolled into the UK National Adult Cardiac
Surgical Audit dataset. The primary outcome was operative mortality.
Variations related to hospital or surgeon effects were quantified by a
generalized mixed linear model and risk-adjusted funnel plots by displaying the individual standardized mortality ratio against expected
deaths. Independent predictive variables of mortality were: age [odds
ratio (OR) 1.02; P < 0.001]; malperfusion (OR 1.79; P < 0.001); left
ventricular ejection fraction (moderate: OR 1.40; P = 0.001; poor:
OR 2.83; P < 0.001); previous cardiac surgery (OR 2.29; P < 0.001);
pre-operative mechanical ventilation (OR 2.76; P < 0.001); pre-operative resuscitation (OR 3.36; P = 0.028); and concomitant CABG
(OR 2.29; P < 0.001). The authors found a significant inverse relationship between surgeons but not centre annual volume with
outcomes.
Benedetto and colleagues conclude that patient characteristics,
intra-operative factors, and high-volume surgeons are strong determinants of outcomes following TAAAD surgery. These findings may
help in refining clinical decision-making, supporting patient counselling, and be used by policy makers for quality assurance and service
provision improvement. This paper is accompanied by an Editorial
by Martin Czerny and Bartosz Rylski from the University Heart
Center Freiburg in Bad Krozingen, Germany.16 The authors highlight
that-in summary-its all about the location of the primary entry
tear as well as the presence or absence of malperfusion. This knowledge, together with the routine application of the TEM classification
and the GERAADA score, mirrors the development of AAD to the
archetype of personalized aortic medicine and will help in further refinement of therapeutical strategies, leading to better outcome in the
years to come.
The choice between percutaneous coronary interventions
(PCIs) and CABG remains controversial.5,17 In a Clinical Research
article entitled 'Ten-year all-cause death after percutaneous or surgical revascularization in diabetic patients
with complex coronary artery disease', Rutao Wang from
the National University of Ireland, and colleagues sought to compare rates of all-cause death at 10 years following CABG or PCI in
patients with or without diabetes.18 The SYNTAXES study evaluated up to 10-year survival of 1800 patients with three-vessel disease (3VD) and/or left main coronary artery disease (LMCAD)
randomized to receive either PCI or CABG in the SYNTAX trial.
In diabetics, the risk of mortality was numerically higher with PCI
compared with CABG at 5 years (19.6% vs. 13.3%, HR 1.53;
P = 0.075), with the opposite seen between 5 and 10 years (PCI vs.
CABG 20.8% vs. 24.4%, HR 0.82; P = 0.366). Irrespective of diabetic status, there was no significant difference in all-cause death at
10 years between patients receiving PCI or CABG; the absolute
