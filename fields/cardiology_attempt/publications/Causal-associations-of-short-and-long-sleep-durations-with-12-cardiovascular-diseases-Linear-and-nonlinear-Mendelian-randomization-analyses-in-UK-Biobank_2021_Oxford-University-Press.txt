Aims

Observational studies have suggested strong associations between sleep duration and many cardiovascular diseases
(CVDs), but causal inferences have not been confirmed. We aimed to determine the causal associations between
genetically predicted sleep duration and 12 CVDs using both linear and nonlinear Mendelian randomization (MR)
designs.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
Genetic variants associated with continuous, short (<_6 h) and long (>_9 h) sleep durations were used to examine
the causal associations with 12 CVDs among 404 044 UK Biobank participants of White British ancestry. Linear
and results
MR analyses showed that genetically predicted sleep duration was negatively associated with arterial hypertension,
atrial fibrillation, pulmonary embolism, and chronic ischaemic heart disease after correcting for multiple tests
(P < 0.001). Nonlinear MR analyses demonstrated nonlinearity (L-shaped associations) between genetically predicted sleep duration and four CVDs, including arterial hypertension, chronic ischaemic heart disease, coronary
artery disease, and myocardial infarction. Complementary analyses provided confirmative evidence of the
adverse effects of genetically predicted short sleep duration on the risks of 5 out of the 12 CVDs, including arterial
hypertension, pulmonary embolism, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, and chronic ischaemic heart
disease (P < 0.001), and suggestive evidence for atrial fibrillation (P < 0.05). However, genetically predicted long
sleep duration was not associated with any CVD.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
This study suggests that genetically predicted short sleep duration is a potential causal risk factor of several CVDs,
while genetically predicted long sleep duration is unlikely to be a causal risk factor for most CVDs.

Introduction
As a modifiable lifestyle behaviour, sleep is vital to human health.
Observational studies have consistently suggested associations between sleep duration and adverse health outcomes.1-5 Several metaanalyses have shown either U- or J-shaped associations between
sleep duration and various cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), indicating
that both short (<_6 h) and long (>_9 h) sleep durations are associated
with higher risks of CVDs.6-9 These studies have also shown that
these adverse effects are more pronounced in people with longer
sleep duration. The associations of short sleep duration with CVDs
are supported by experimental studies, which have consistently
shown that sleep deprivation or restriction would exert various adverse effects on the cardiovascular systems of healthy participants,
including increased activity in the sympathetic nervous system,
inflammation, and accelerated atherosclerosis.10-12 In contrast, no

experimental study to date has suggested that sleeping longer
than 9 h is inherently harmful, and there is a lack of hypothetical
mechanisms in explaining the adverse effects of long sleep duration
on CVD risks, especially in healthy participants.13,14 Although the
underlying reasons for long sleep duration leading to increased CVD
risks are not highly apparent, many experts have suggested that a
long sleep duration is a fatal lifestyle factor in the general population.9,15,16 However, this statement is potentially an overclaim or
even misleading, if the causal role of long sleep duration on cardiovascular outcomes is not clarified.
Traditional observational studies, even when they are well
designed, prospective with large sample sizes, are prone to be biased
by residual confounding effects and reverse causation. Previous studies have shown that demographic or clinical factors, such as lack of
employment, low socioeconomic status, and depression,17,18 may
confound the associations between sleep duration and CVDs.5

Sleep duration and risk of 12 cardiovascular diseases

Methods
Study participants
The UK Biobank (UKB) cohort recruited >500 000 participants aged
40-69 years in 22 assessment centres across the UK between 2006 and
2010. All participants gave informed consent to participate in the study
and were required to complete a series of baseline measurements. All
the information, such as sleep duration, disease conditions, confounding
factors, and genetic variants, is available in the UKB.24 To minimize the
potential confounding caused by ancestry, our main analysis only included
unrelated participants of European ancestry. After detailed quality
control of the UKB participants and genetic variants, a total of 404 044
participants were included in the analyses. Detailed information regarding
participant selection is available in Supplementary material online, Text S1.

Ascertainment of exposure and outcomes
The main exposure of the present study was self-reported sleep duration,
which was assessed by a standardized question: 'About how many hours
of sleep do you get in every 24 hours? (please include naps)' with
responses in integer hours. We excluded participants with missing sleep
duration data or sleep duration out of 4-11 h/day range to minimize the
incredible sleep duration outliers. Continuous sleep duration was classified into short (<_6 h), normal (7-8 h), and long (>_9 h) sleep durations
according to previous study.25
To characterize the causal associations between genetically predicted
sleep duration and different cardiovascular risks, we included a broad
range of CVDs, including cerebrovascular diseases (ischaemic stroke,
haemorrhagic stroke, and transient ischaemic attack), thromboembolic
diseases (pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis), and other CVDs
(arterial hypertension, atrial fibrillation, chronic ischaemic heart disease,
coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, and

peripheral artery disease). All CVD events were obtained according to
the first occurrence of a set of diagnostic codes for those CVD outcomes
defined by the 3-digit code of the International Classification of Diseases
10th Revision (https://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/). The source of
first occurrence data was derived from hospital inpatient records, death
register, primary care records, and self-report health conditions from the
UKB assessment clinics. The definition of each CVD is presented in
Supplementary material online, Table S1.

Single-nucleotide polymorphisms and
genetic risk score as instrumental variables
We used 78 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were associated with continuous sleep duration at a genome-wide significance
threshold (P < 5  10-8), as reported in a recent genome-wide association
study (GWAS) in the UKB,25 as genetic instruments (Supplementary
material online, Table S2). The unweighted genetic risk score (GRS) for
each participant was calculated by summing the number of sleep
duration-increasing alleles. In general, the unweighted GRS explained
0.61% of the variance in sleep duration (R2 = 0.61%, F-statistic = 2459). In
addition, we used the SNPs for short (<_6 h/day) and long (>_9 h/day) sleep
durations from the same GWAS in the UKB25 as instrumental variables in
the complementary analyses (Supplementary material online, Tables S3
and S4).

Study design
We first used a simple method to investigate the association between
unweighted GRS of self-reported sleep duration and 12 CVDs
(Supplementary material online, Text S2). Then, we used standard linear
and nonlinear MR analyses to estimate the causal associations between
genetically predicted continuous sleep duration and 12 CVDs. We first
performed a linear MR analysis to assess the associations between
genetically predicted sleep duration and CVDs. The estimate yielded
by the linear MR analysis indicates the average change in the outcome
resulting from 1 h increase in sleep duration. Then, we performed a
nonlinear MR analysis to estimate the shape of associations between
genetically predicted sleep duration and CVDs. Given the nonlinear
associations between continuous sleep duration and CVDs, we also used
SNPs associated with short and long sleep durations to estimate the
causal effects of genetically predicted short and long sleep durations on
CVDs in the complementary analyses. The causal estimates [i.e. the odds
ratios (ORs) for CVDs] were rescaled so that they could be interpreted
for per doubling of genetic liability for short and long sleep durations, as
previously described.26

Linear Mendelian randomization analyses
We used a two-stage least squares method to assess the associations
between genetically predicted sleep duration and 12 CVD outcomes
produced by the linear MR analyses. We first regressed the exposures on
the GRS and then regressed the outcome on the fitted values of the
exposure from the first-stage regression. Both stages were adjusted for
age, sex, assessment centres, top 10 principal components of ancestry,
and genotyping arrays of the participants. To avoid the potential violation
of MR assumptions, we further assessed the validity of the genetic variants
by testing the associations of potential confounders with the GRS and
repeated our MR analyses with an adjustment included for the confounders. Other MR methods (inverse-variance weighted, weighted median
and MR-Egger) were also conducted with 'TwoSampleMR' package to
account for potential pleiotropy (Supplementary material online,
Text S3).27,28 We also conducted RadialMR29 analyses using modified
second-order weights to identify outliers. We used an a level of 0.05
divided by the number of SNPs being used in the MR analyses. Once the

Mendelian randomization (MR) using genetic variants as instrumental
variables can provide unconfounded estimates and overcome the
limitations of observational studies. The rationale for the MR design is
that the genetic variants are fixed at conception and randomly
assigned to individuals. Thus, the design can be conceptualized as a
natural experiment and is immune to the effects of residual confounding and reverse causation. Recent studies have employed the
linear MR method to investigate the causal associations between
sleep duration and several CVDs,19-23 but the causality for a broader
range of CVDs, such as atrial fibrillation, pulmonary embolism, and
deep vein thrombosis, is still unclear. Notably, the characteristics of
the causal associations between sleep duration and many CVDs are
likely nonlinear, as reflected by the U- or J-shaped associations as
identified in previous observational studies. To our knowledge, there
is no study that has attempted to clarify the potential nonlinear MR
associations between sleep duration and CVDs.
In the present study, we aimed to determine the potential causal
associations between sleep duration and a broad range of CVDs via
MR analyses. We first performed linear MR analyses to estimate the
associations between genetically predicted sleep duration and CVD
risks. Second, we employed nonlinear MR analyses to characterize
the shape of associations between genetically predicted sleep
duration and CVDs. Finally, we used genetic variants associated with
short and long sleep durations to determine how genetically predicted short and long sleep durations are causally associated with
CVDs, respectively.

outliers were identified, the outliers were removed, and the results were
reanalysed. We used an online tool (https://sb452.shinyapps.io/power/)
to estimate the statistical power of a linear MR analysis (Supplementary
material online, Table S5).

Nonlinear Mendelian randomization analyses

Complementary analyses
In the complementary analyses, we used the sum of the short or long
sleep duration risk alleles multiplied by the GWAS effect sizes and then
regressed against these CVDs, adjusting for age, sex, assessment centre,
top 10 principal components of ancestry, and genotyping array.20 The
effects estimates were scaled as described in the preceding text. For the
sensitivity analysis, we used the weighted median, MR-Egger, and
RadialMR methods27-29 to account for any potential pleiotropy and

We used nonlinear MR with a piecewise linear method to assess the
nonlinear associations between genetically predicted sleep durations and
12 CVDs.30 In brief, we divided our sample into three strata according to
the residual variation of the continuous sleep duration after regressing on
the GRS. Then, we calculated piecewise linear MR estimates in each stratum, and these are referred to as localized average causal effects (LACE)
in these strata. We reported the P-values from two tests for nonlinearity,

Sleep duration and risk of 12 cardiovascular diseases

Association between unweighted genetic
risk score of self-reported sleep duration
and 12 cardiovascular diseases

Linear Mendelian randomization
analyses of sleep duration with 12
cardiovascular diseases
The linear MR analyses showed overall negative associations between
genetically predicted sleep duration and 4 of the 12 CVD outcomes
(Figure 1), including arterial hypertension, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary
embolism, and chronic ischaemic heart disease. The OR per
genetically predicted 1-h increase in sleep duration ranged from 0.51

Table 2

[95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38-0.69; P = 1.02E-05] for pulmonary
embolism to 0.81 (95% CI 0.74-0.88; P = 4.54E-06) for arterial
hypertension (Figure 1), which were consistent with findings regarding
the associations between unweighted GRS of self-reported
sleep duration and CVDs (Table 2). There was suggestive evidence of
negative associations between genetically predicted sleep duration
and cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease, and deep vein thrombosis (P < 0.05), whereas no significant associations were found
between genetically predicted sleep duration and other CVDs, such
as ischaemic stroke, transient ischaemic attack, haemorrhagic stroke,
myocardial infarction, and peripheral artery disease.
In the sensitivity analyses, we adjusted for the potential confounders that were significantly associated with the GRS (Supplementary
material online, Table S8), and the results were still consistent with
those of the main analysis (Supplementary material online, Table S9).
The radial MR analyses indicated outlying genetic variants in some of
the outcomes, including one outlier SNP each for atrial fibrillation,
coronary artery disease, ischaemic stroke, and transient ischaemic attack, respectively, and six outlier SNPs for arterial hypertension
(Supplementary material online, Figure S1). The pleiotropic effects of
these outliers were shown in the phenome-wide association study
analyses of the outlying SNPs with all existing traits in the MR-Base
database (Supplementary material online, Figure S2). After excluding
these outliers, the OR of per genetically predicted 1-h increase in

The baseline characteristics of participants in different GRS quartiles
of self-reported sleep duration are shown in Supplementary material
online, Table S6. The mean sleep duration was significantly associated
with the GRS groups, with P < 2.0E-16 for trend across categories.
We observed significant associations for the prevalence of pulmonary
embolism, arterial hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and chronic ischaemic heart disease, with the GRS quartiles (all P-values < 4.2E-03,
Supplementary material online, Table S7). To further test whether a
higher GRS was associated with a lower OR of those CVDs, we
investigated the associations between GRS of each category and 12
CVDs, with lowest GRS as the reference group (Table 2). Compared
to the lowest quartile of GRS, the highest quartile of GRS was associated with a 14.0% lower odds for pulmonary embolism (P = 3.61E-5),
4.0% lower odds for hypertension (P = 2.45E-4), 7.0% lower odds for
atrial fibrillation (P = 5.82E-4), and 7.0% lower odds for chronic ischaemic heart disease (P = 1.52E-4).

relatively lower precision. The MR-Egger analysis revealed consistent
estimates and suggested no directional pleiotropy for the CVD

Nonlinear MR analyses were performed with a piecewise linear
method using three strata according to the residual variation of sleep
duration. The results indicated L-shaped associations between genetically predicted continuous sleep duration and the risks of arterial
hypertension (Cochran Q P = 9.96E-14; Quadratic test P = 7.22E-13),
coronary artery disease (Cochran Q P = 1.90E-07; Quadratic test
P = 2.15E-08), chronic ischaemic heart disease (Cochran Q

(Cochran Q P = 9.52E-08; Quadratic test P = 1.28E-06). This

Discussion
In the current study, we found that unweighted GRS of self-reported
sleep duration is associated with a lower risk of 4 out of 12 CVDs
tested in this study (i.e. arterial hypertension, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary embolism, and chronic ischaemic heart disease). The linear
MR analyses further provide evidence that genetically predicted sleep
duration is a potentially causally factor of these four CVDs.
Complementary analyses provided further evidence of adverse
effects of genetically predicted short sleep duration on the risks of
5 out of 12 CVDs (Graphical abstract), with three overlapping
with four CVDs found in linear association. However, genetically
predicted long sleep duration was not adversely associated with any
CVD. Nonlinear MR analyses demonstrated an L shaped rather than
a U-shaped association between sleep duration and several CVDs.
These analyses from different angles consistently suggest that genetically predicted short sleep duration is a potentially causal risk factor
for common CVDs, while genetically predicted long sleep duration is
unlikely to be a causal risk factor for CVDs.
Many conventional observational studies have confirmed that
short sleep duration is longitudinally associated with increased risks
of many CVDs.6-8 Previous MR studies conducted by Daghlas et al.20
and Gao et al.31 have also suggested that short sleep duration may be
a potential causal risk factor for some CVDs, such as myocardial
infarction and coronary artery disease. Nevertheless, recent MR
studies reported inconsistent results on the causal association
between sleep duration and coronary heart disease.22,23 One of the
reasons may be due to the fact that there were fewer genetic variants
of sleep duration in these studies than that of the previous two
studies,20,31 which may have decreased their statistical power with
potential false negative results. In the current study, we employed the
same set of genetic variants as Daghlas et al.20 and Gao et al.31 and
found consistent evidence for the causal adverse effects of genetically
predicted short sleep duration on a broad range of CVDs, including
myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease. Larsson and
Markus32 found that genetic liability to insomnia is associated with a
modest increased risk of four CVDs by using a two-sample MR study.
Although clinical presentation of insomnia and short sleep duration is
different, it seems that they influence cardiometabolic health through
some common pathophysiological mechanisms, including dysfunction
of the sympathetic nervous system, acceleration of metabolic
diseases and atherosclerosis, increased inflammation, and cardiac dysfunction.11,12,33,34 Recent studies also suggested that extended sleep
duration could improve individuals' cardiovascular health, especially

..
.. in college students or prehypertension participants, who are usually
.. deprived of sleep.35,36 Therefore, increasing sleep duration among
..
.. short sleepers might be a promising strategy to reduce CVD risk.
..
Although long sleep duration has been found to have stronger
..
.. associations with CVDs than short sleep duration,16 it has long been
.. a debate whether long sleep duration is a risk to one's health or is
..
.. simply a surrogate marker of risk. One of the key reasons is that
.. there is a lack of clear experimental evidence to support long sleep
..
.. duration as a harmful effect to cardiovascular system, especially in
.. healthy participants.13,14 On the other hand, long sleep duration is
..
.. closely associated with a number of risk factors of poor health status,
.. such as depression, antidepressant use, poor sleep quality, low socio..
.. economic status, unemployment, and sedentary lifestyles.9,17,37 The
.. current study has provided suggestive evidence that genetically pre..
.. dicted long sleep duration is unlikely to be causally associated with
.. the risks of CVDs. Since many aforementioned conditions can lead to
..
.. longer sleep, the association between long sleep duration and CVD
.. reported in observational studies may reflect a reverse causality or
..
.. residual confounding.38 Therefore, it is clinically advisable to look out
.. for underlying morbidities (e.g. depression and sleep apnea) rather
..
.. than a direct recommendation of reducing sleep duration for people
..
.. with long sleep duration.
..
Because of the limited number of SNPs associated with long
..
.. sleep duration, it may give rise to the concern of weak instrumental
.. variables. We have considered this concern in our analyses and
..
.. believe that the potentially weak instrumental variable is not likely to
.. influence our conclusions. First, it has been demonstrated that any
..
.. potential bias of weak instrumental variables in one-sample analysis
.. will be towards the direction of the observational association
..
.. between risk factor and outcome, rather than the null hypothesis.39
.. Second, in the case of a null causal effect, a higher F-statistic of SNP
..
.. exposure (i.e. >10) suggests less bias.39 In the present study, the
.. estimated F-statistic for long sleep duration was 294.7. Therefore,
..
.. the bias, if any, shall be very limited. Third, the causal estimates of
.. long sleep duration on most CVDs were largely consistent across
..
.. different MR methods when using either weighted allele scores20 or
.. summarized data.40
..
..
.. Strengths and limitations
..
.. Compared with previous observational studies,3,5,41 we used a MR
.. study design to assess the causal associations between genetically
..
.. predicted sleep duration and a wide range of CVDs in the same
..
.. cohort. This design could minimize the potential biases due to con.. founding and reverse causality in the observational studies. On the
..
.. other hand, the statistical power is relatively larger in the present
.. study than previous MR studies,20,22,23 benefiting from a larger sample
..
.. size and more genetic variants. Another strength is that we used a
.. nonlinear MR method to characterize the shape of causal associa..
.. tions between genetically predicted sleep duration and CVDs.
.. Consistent evidence between linear and nonlinear MR supports the
..
.. causal adverse effects of genetically predicted short sleep duration on
.. many CVDs.
..
..
Some limitations should be noted when interpreting our findings.
.. First, sleep duration was self-reported rather than objectively meas..
.. ured, such as by using polysomnography (PSG), but PSG is not usually
.. feasible in a large cohort study. Previous studies have suggested that
..
. there is a moderate correlation between self-reported and objective

pleiotropic effects of these outliers are shown in Supplementary material online, Figure S5. After excluding these outliers, the OR estimates for arterial hypertension (1.15; 95% CI 1.09-1.22, P = 4.17E-7),
coronary artery disease (1.29; 95% CI 1.16-1.43, P = 3.78E-06), myocardial infarction (1.25; 95% CI 1.12-1.39, P = 5.78E-05), and chronic
ischaemic heart disease (1.12; 95% CI 1.02-1.21, P = 9.69E-03) did
not change markedly. For the long sleep duration, the MR-Egger analyses detected potential pleiotropy for the outcomes of deep vein
thrombosis and cardiomyopathy, but the results in the main and sensitivity analyses trended towards the null hypothesis for all CVDs
(Figure 2 and Supplementary material online, Table S12).

Conclusions
In this study, both linear and nonlinear MR analyses suggest that
genetically predicted short sleep duration is associated with modest
increased risks of most CVDs. However, genetically predicted long
sleep duration is not associated with the risk of most CVDs.
Therefore, the extension of sleep may benefit cardiovascular health
for those people with sleep loss. For those people with long
sleep duration, reducing sleep duration per se is unlikely to improve
cardiovascular health.

measured sleep duration.42 In addition, habitual self-reported sleep
duration seems rather stable within adult individuals across time,10,43
which suggests that baseline sleep duration may represent a longterm exposure to a certain extent. Second, the genetic variants were
associated with some confounders, such as body mass index,
Townsend deprivation index, and education level of each participant,
and might be affected by pleiotropy. However, the results were
broadly consistent with those of the main analyses after adjusting for
potential confounders. Third, the statistical powers of some outcomes (e.g. haemorrhagic stroke and transient ischaemic attack) are
relatively low, which may raise the concern of false negatives. Fourth,
the one-sample design is easily influenced by weak instrument bias.
However, the F-statistic suggests a small magnitude of bias due to
sample overlap. Fifth, although there is a lack of external validation of
the GRS in the current study, a recent study with an independent
clinical cohort from the USA using the same set of 78 SNPs has
verified the association between the GRS and self-reported sleep
duration with an apparently larger variance of self-reported sleep
duration than UKB.19 Finally, the selection criteria of the UKB tended
to include relatively healthy participants aged 40-69 years at baseline,
and this may limit the generalizability of our findings.

Translational perspective
This study employed both linear and nonlinear Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses to estimate the associations between genetically
predicted sleep duration and a series of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). The MR results suggested that genetically predicted short sleep
duration is potentially causally associated with increased risks of several CVDs, including arterial hypertension, pulmonary embolism,
coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, and chronic ischaemic heart disease. These results have suggested that increasing sleep
duration among short sleepers shall serve as a preventive strategy to reduce CVD risk. However, genetically predicted long sleep duration is unlikely to be a potential causal risk factor for most CVDs. These findings suggest that simply reducing sleep per se is not likely
to improve cardiovascular health in people with long sleep duration.
