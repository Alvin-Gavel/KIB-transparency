Aims

Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is a recognized causal risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease but its role for
acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) is controversial. In this study, we evaluated the association of Lp(a) with large artery
atherosclerosis (LAA) stroke and risk of recurrent cerebrovascular events in AIS patients.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
For this analysis of the prospective, observational, multicentre BIOSIGNAL cohort study we measured Lp(a) levels
and results
in plasma samples of 1733 primarily Caucasian (98.6%) AIS patients, collected within 24 h after symptom onset.

Primary outcomes were LAA stroke aetiology and recurrent cerebrovascular events (ischaemic stroke or transient
ischaemic attack) within 1 year. We showed that Lp(a) levels are independently associated with LAA stroke aetiology [adjusted odds ratio 1.48, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.14-1.90, per unit log10Lp(a) increase] and identified
age as a potent effect modifier (Pinteraction =0.031) of this association. The adjusted odds ratio for LAA stroke in
patients aged <60 years was 3.64 (95% CI 1.76-7.52) per unit log10Lp(a) increase and 4.04 (95% CI 1.73-9.43) using
the established cut-off >_100 nmol/l. For 152 recurrent cerebrovascular events, we did not find a significant association in the whole cohort. However, Lp(a) levels >_100 nmol/l were associated with an increased risk for recurrent
events among patients who were either <60 years [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 2.40, 95% CI 1.05-5.47], had evident
LAA stroke aetiology (adjusted HR 2.18, 95% CI 1.08-4.40), or had no known atrial fibrillation (adjusted HR 1.60,
95% CI 1.03-2.48).

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
Elevated Lp(a) was independently associated with LAA stroke aetiology and risk of recurrent cerebrovascular
events among primarily Caucasian individuals aged <60 years or with evident arteriosclerotic disease.

Lipoprotein(a) in acute ischaemic stroke

Graphical Abstract

Introduction
Despite a decreasing incidence of acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) in
most developed countries, the absolute numbers of stroke survivors
and the lifetime risk for stroke are increasing globally.1 Based on
population-based studies up to 25% of all strokes are recurrent
strokes and they are more likely to be disabling or fatal than first ever
strokes.2 Optimal secondary prevention depends on the level of evidence for a specific underlying aetiology, which remains undetermined in about 30% of cases.3 Especially in younger stroke patients,
the underlying aetiology is often undetermined partly because recognized vascular risk factors have not yet developed but also because
so far unknown risk factors may play a more prominent role. This
outlines the importance to search for and evaluate these unknown
risk factors especially in the younger stroke population. Blood
markers currently not routinely measured may be an important

adjunct to routine diagnostic work-up with regard to aetiological classification and risk estimation.4
Lp(a) is a lipoprotein composed of apolipoprotein B-100 and apolipoprotein(a). Its structural similarities to low-density lipoprotein
(LDL) and plasminogen contribute to its atherogenic and thrombogenic properties.5,6 First described in 1963,7 scientific interest was
reignited in the past decades after several lines of evidence indicated
that Lp(a) is a causal risk factor of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.5,8,9 A large number of studies have suggested an association between elevated Lp(a) and the promotion of cardiovascular disease in
the setting of primary10,11 as well as secondary prevention,12-15
backed up by a recent meta-analysis.16 Genetic studies have strengthened the evidence for a causal relationship of Lp(a) with cardiovascular events.17,18 Furthermore, by some estimates, up to 90% of the
variation in plasma Lp(a) concentration between individuals is attributed to genetic variance in the apo(a) gene.19

Methods
Study design and participants
The BIOSIGNAL (Biomarker Signature of Stroke Aetiology) study
(ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02274727) is a prospective, observational, multicentre, inception cohort study to evaluate selected blood biomarkers in
patients with acute ischaemic stroke measured within 24 h from symptom onset. From October 2014 through October 2017, a total of 1759
adult patients admitted with AIS were enrolled at nine European stroke
centres. Ischaemic stroke was defined according to the World Health
Organization criteria as an acute focal neurological deficit lasting longer
than 24 h and not attributed to another definite cause, or, if symptoms
lasted less than 24 h, cranial imaging [computed tomography (CT) or
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)] must have confirmed a new ischaemic
infarct. Patients with haemorrhagic stroke, TIA lacking tissue-based confirmation of ischaemia, patients discharged with a diagnosis other than ischaemic stroke (i.e. stroke mimics) or patients who refused informed
consent were excluded. The BIOSIGNAL study was approved by local
ethics committees and conducted according to the principles expressed
in the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients or their welfare guardians provided written informed consent. The de-identified data supporting the
findings of this study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.

Procedures and outcomes
On admission, all participants received CT and/or MRI. Demographic variables, vital signs, vascular risk factors and stroke severity by the the
National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) were collected by neurovascular fellows. Comorbidities were assessed by the Charlson
Comorbidity Index modified for stroke patients (CCI) by patient selfreported medical history and available discharge reports.25 Per protocol,
participants received standard of care aetiological work-up including 12lead electrocardiography (ECG), >24 h continuous ECG monitoring,
transthoracic or transoesophageal echocardiography, neurovascular
ultrasound and/or CT or magnetic resonance angiography. Stroke aetiology was determined according to the TOAST (Trial of Org 10172 in
Acute Stroke Treatment) classification.26 Additionally, the Causative
Classification System (CCS), a web-based version of the SSS-TOAST
classification,27 was used to reduce intra- and inter-rater variability and
minimize potential bias arising from misclassification of stroke aetiology.

..
Patients were followed either during an outpatient visit or with a struc..
.. tured telephone interview. Functional outcome was measured using the
.. modified Rankin Scale (mRS).28 Predefined outcomes were LAA stroke
..
.. assessed by TOAST and SSS-TOAST classification on hospital discharge
.. as well as time to recurrent ischaemic cerebrovascular event (AIS or TIA)
..
.. within 1 year after the index stroke. Specific definitions of outcomes are
.. provided in the supplemental material.
..
..
.. Biomarker measurement
.. Blood was drawn within 24 hours of symptom onset during the first rou..
.. tine blood sampling in EDTA containing plastic tubes. Samples were im.. mediately centrifuged at 3000g at 4 C for 20 min, aliquoted and frozen at
..
.. -80 C until the time of analysis. Lp(a) levels were assessed in batches of
.. thawed plasma with the Roche Tina-quant Lipoprotein(a) second generation
..
.. assay on Cobas c702 platform (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) in
.. the Institute of Clinical Chemistry of the University Hospital of Zurich,
.. Switzerland as the central laboratory. Plasma levels are expressed in nano..
.. mol per liter (nmol/L). The intra-assay and inter-assay coefficient of variation,
.. defined as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean, was <5%, respect..
.. ively. The manufacturer defined the lower limits of quantification (LoQ) and
.. detection (LoD) with 20 and 7 nmol/L, respectively. Lp(a) levels below LoD
.. (22.8%) were measured twice for confirmation and were assigned a value of
..
.. LoD divided by the square root of two as recommend previously.29 For
.. measurements below LoQ (53.9%), we used the apparent concentrations
..
.. recorded by the assay as suggested for epidemiological studies.30 By a
.. method comparison with another immunoturbidimetric assay using Denka
..
.. Seiken antibodies and calibrators traceable to the WHO/IFCC reference
.. SRM 2B material, we found the Roche Tinaquant assay to measure lower
.. levels of Lp(a) at very low concentrations, which has been reported earlier.31
..
.. However, both at concentrations <_12 nmol/L and >12 nmol/L, the two
.. measurements showed very good correlations (r = 0.942 and r = 0.976, re..
.. spectively, Passing Bablock).
..
..
.. Statistical analysis
.. Discrete variables are summarized as counts (percentages) and continu.. ous variables as medians [interquartile ranges (IQR)]. Common logarith..
.. mic transformation (base 10) was performed to transform to normality
.. for skewed distributions. For two-group comparisons, Fisher's exact test
..
.. and Mann-Whitney U-test were performed, while for multigroup com.. parisons the Kruskal-Wallis test with appropriate post-hoc testing was
..
.. used. To investigate the association of Lp(a) (as continuous as well as
.. dichotomized value) with LAA stroke aetiology, binary logistic regression
.. models were constructed to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confi..
.. dence intervals (95% CI). Multivariable models were built by identifying
.. statistically relevant covariates in univariate logistic regression with a cut..
.. off P-value of <0.1. Demographic variables (age, sex) and established vas.. cular risk factors (arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidaemia,
.. active smoking, positive family history for cardiovascular events, history
..
.. of stroke and body mass index) were included regardless of their signifi.. cance. Backward elimination was then used for the selection of the final
..
.. model, with P < 0.05 considered significant. To assess the discriminatory
.. ability of Lp(a), area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
..
.. (AUROC) was calculated for the models with and without Lp(a) and
.. compared using the likelihood-ratio test. To test for model optimism we
.. additionally applied 10-fold cross-validation to obtain mean AUROCs
..
.. with bias corrected 95% CIs. In addition, continuous net reclassification
.. index (NRI) was calculated. To account for inter-rater variability in regard
..
.. to aetiological classification, we validated the model with the CCS by
.. using the SSS-TOAST classification. Interaction analyses were performed
.. to assess effect modification of Lp(a) by demographic and vascular risk
..
. factors including the use of lipid-lowering drugs prior to the index stroke.

Despite the growing body of evidence supporting a causal association of Lp(a) with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, the relationship between Lp(a) and ischaemic stroke remains conflicting.
While incident ischaemic stroke was included as an outcome measure in cardiovascular risk cohorts and population-based studies,4,18,20
only few studies examined the association of Lp(a) with stroke recurrence.21,22 Evidence on the association of Lp(a) with underlying
stroke aetiology is even more scarce23,24 despite the fact that overall
risk of stroke recurrence differs widely between aetiological
subgroups.3
We therefore aimed to validate the association of Lp(a) with LAA
stroke aetiology through a prospective multicentre cohort study
within a predominantly Caucasian population. In addition, we investigated the association of Lp(a) with the risk of recurrent cerebrovascular events [ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA)]
within 1 year in all AIS patients, as well as in subgroups stratified by
age and stroke aetiology.

In the final model, we further included Lp(a) as a dichotomized variable

To determine the association of Lp(a) with recurrent cerebrovascular
events, Cox proportional-hazards regression analysis was performed utilizing the established cut-off of 100 nmol/L. Only previous stroke was
associated with recurrent events in univariate Cox regression; however,

well as for subjects without known or newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation.
Resulting Kaplan-Meier failure estimates were compared with the logrank test. Additional subgroup analysis was performed with Lp(a)

Results
Baseline cohort characteristics
A total of 1759 patients with an AIS were consecutively enrolled in the
study. Blood samples were available in 1733 patients (98.5%). Median
Lp(a) levels were 17 nmol/l (IQR 8-54), 285 (16.5%) participants had
elevated Lp(a) levels (>_100 nmol/l). A total of 258 (14.7%) strokes
were classified as LAA strokes. This number increased to 324 (18.4%)
with the use of the CCS. Table 1 displays patient baseline characteristics stratified by LAA stroke aetiology according to the TOAST classification system and the CCS [for distribution of Lp(a) according to
other stroke aetiologies see Table S1 of the supplementary material].

interaction of Lp(a) levels (nmol/L) and age in regard to the predicted probabilities (colour scale) for the classification of large artery atherosclerosis (LAA) stroke aetiology according to the
TOAST criteria. The contour plot illustrates that in younger
patients Lp(a) levels have greater discriminatory value in regard to
the classification of LAA stroke compared to older patients. This
could be explained by the fact that in younger patients traditional
5risk factors have not yet developed, thus genetically predetermined risk factors as Lp(a) levels have more clinical impact.

Discussion
In this prospective, multicentre AIS cohort we found Lp(a) to be independently associated with LAA stroke aetiology as well as recurrent stroke in patients younger than 60 years. When Lp(a) was added
to the best diagnostic models of stroke aetiology, we found a moderate but significant improvement of the model performance. Notably,
the significance of the observed association remained unaltered after
validation with the CCS, a method that has previously been shown to
considerably reduce inter-rater variability.34 Even though, agreement
between CCS and TOAST classification is only moderate,35 which is
also reflected in the difference in frequencies we observed. Further,
no significant interaction between Lp(a) and prior lipid-lowering therapy was noticed.16 Previous studies on the association of Lp(a) with
stroke aetiology, although being scarce, have reported comparable
results. In a comparable sized Asian cohort, high levels of Lp(a) were
associated with LAA stroke and atherosclerotic burden.23 Smaller
retrospective studies mainly in Caucasian cohorts made similar findings but only two of them have used the TOAST classification
system.24,36
Interestingly, our data identified age as a prominent effect modifier,
with a stronger association between Lp(a) and LAA among younger
patients. This could be explained by the fact that in younger stroke
patients traditional risk factors have not yet developed37 (it takes
time before lifestyle and environmental factors cumulate) and

Lp(a)-which is considered a lifelong, still non-modifiable and largely
genetically predetermined risk factor-has more clinical impact. For
stratified analysis, we used an age cut-off of 60 years reflecting the
20th percentile of our cohort; however, there is currently no consensus on an age cut-off to define stroke in younger patients. Most
authors choose an arbitrary cut-off between 55 and 65 years based
on pathophysiological or epidemiological considerations.
In the overall cohort, we did not find any significant association of
Lp(a) with recurrent ischaemic events if dichotomized by the conventional risk threshold of 100 nmol/L. This result is in line with a study
of Lange et al. showing an increased risk for a combined cardiovascular outcome but not for stroke and TIA alone in AIS patients with
high levels of Lp(a) dichotomized by a cut-off of 30 mg/dL (
72 nmol/L).21 In contrast, an association with recurrent stroke within
90 days by the same cut-off was shown recently in a primarily Asian
cohort.22
In further subgroup analysis, however, we identified significantly
increased risk for recurrent cerebrovascular event in patients with
LAA according to the CCS. Also, after exclusion of patients with
known or newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation, elevated Lp(a) was significantly associated with recurrent stroke in the remaining cohort.
These findings support the assumption that Lp(a) differentially interacts with the aetiology of stroke. It appears of pathophysiological
relevance in atherosclerotic vascular disease leading to stroke but
not or less so in cardioembolic stroke. This finding is in line with data
from the ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) study which
examined 14 221 individuals free of cardiovascular disease and investigated the risk of incident ischaemic stroke. Lp(a) above the 80th
percentile increased the adjusted risk for non-lacunar stroke (rate
ratio 1.42, 95% CI 1.10-1.84), but not for cardioembolic or lacunar
stroke.38 A subsequent analysis revealed that Lp(a) levels >50mg/dL
( 120 nmol/L) increase the relative risk of stroke among individuals
without atrial fibrillation, but not among patients with atrial fibrillation,39 reinforcing a pathophysiological role of Lp(a) for atherothrombotic stroke.
This hypothesis is also supported by the subgroup analysis in
patients below the age of 60 years since competing risks are less frequent in younger patients who are on the other hand more prone to

genetically determined risk factors. A recent meta-analysis in non-AIS
cohorts has shown similar findings in regard to an age difference for
incident stroke and adverse cardiovascular events.4,40
Currently, lipoprotein apheresis is the only established medical
treatment targeting elevated Lp(a) levels. The effects of novel PCSK9
inhibitors in lowering Lp(a) are only moderate but promising.41,42 A
recent phase II trial investigating a hepatocyte-directed antisense
oligonucleotide to specifically reduce Lp(a) levels showed encouraging results in individuals with established cardiovascular disease43;
however, it has not been proven that lowering Lp(a) will reduce the
risk for major cardiovascular events. A phase III trial (NCT04023552)
currently enrolling participants with Lp(a) levels >_70 mg/dL (
168 nmol/L) will evaluate the impact of Lp(a) reduction on major cardiovascular events.
This study has limitations. Of note, evidence indicates that Lp(a)
may act as an acute phase reactant, thus measurements within the
acute phase might be altered. However, Lp(a) levels increase relatively slow and little compared to other acute phase proteins reaching a
maximum concentration after several days.44 Thus, possible alterations within the first 24 h are likely to be small. In addition, although
limited, evidence indicates that Lp(a) levels remain stable in stroke
patients up to 4 weeks.45 Of note, we observed a high number of
Lp(a) measurements below the lower LoQ of the Roche Tinaquant
assay. Although a method comparison with a different assay showed
good correlations between the two measurements, the Roche assay
has previously been shown to measure lower levels of Lp(a) at high
molecular weight Lp(a) isoforms, which are associated with low
Lp(a) concentrations. At clinical relevant concentrations, however,
measurements are in a similar range with other Lp(a) assays.31
Additional sensitivity analysis with imputed values below the LoQ as
well as analysis with dichotomized Lp(a) levels revealed similar
results, thus bias introduced by non-random distribution of low Lp(a)
levels seemed unlikely. Further, the distribution of stroke subtypes in
our cohort slightly differed from population-based studies due to a
low number of small vessel disease strokes and a larger number of
cardioembolic strokes.3 Possible explanations include referral bias,
because patients with lacunar stroke tend to have less severe clinical
features and are less likely to receive emergency intervention and
therefore may not be referred to tertiary care centres. Additionally,
there may be a higher detection rate of cardioembolic sources due
to extensive cardiac workup in this study. Additionally, the number of
participants that received acute re-canalisation treatment is quite
high; however, we only included patients within the first 24 h after
symptom onset that are more likely to receive interventions and
enrolling centres were mainly high-volume stroke centres with 24 h
intervention services. Furthermore, we chose a cut-off of 100 nmol/L
(40 mg/dL) for dichotomizing Lp(a) levels reflecting the 80th percentile in the Caucasian population.33 However, different cut-offs
exist in the literature when Lp(a) is measured in nmol/L,46 the results
from this study support a cut-off of 100 nmol/L as it is recommended
by the National Lipid Association guidelines.32 Of note, the conventional 100 nmol/L cut-off is close to the optimal discriminative cut-off
derived from the Youden analysis of ROC curves in our cohort study,
thus supporting the used cut-off. Due to the study design, we cannot
rule out the presence of index-event bias. However, because of the
general congruence between risk factors for the index and recurrent
events, this will generally tend to bias results toward the null
