Aims

We tested the hypothesis that the contrasting results for the effect of high-dose, purified omega-3 fatty acids on
the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in two randomized trials, Reduction of
Cardiovascular Events with Icosapent Ethyl-Intervention Trial (REDUCE-IT) vs. Long-Term Outcomes Study to
Assess Statin Residual Risk with Epanova in High Cardiovascular Risk Patients with Hypertriglyceridaemia
(STRENGTH), can be explained by differences in the effect of active and comparator oils on lipid traits and C-reactive protein.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
In the Copenhagen General Population Study (CGPS) with 106 088 individuals, to mimic trial designs we analysed
and results
those who met key inclusion criteria in REDUCE-IT (n = 5684; ASCVD = 852) and STRENGTH (n = 6862;

ASCVD = 697). Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease incidence was followed for the median durations of
REDUCE-IT and STRENGTH (4.9 and 3.5 years), respectively. When combining changes in plasma triglycerides,
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and C-reactive protein observed in the active oil groups of the original studies,
estimated hazard ratios for ASCVD in the CGPS were 0.96 [95% confidence interval 0.93-0.99] mimicking
REDUCE-IT and 0.94 (0.91-0.98) mimicking STRENGTH. In the comparator oil groups, corresponding hazard
ratios were 1.07 (1.04-1.10) and 0.99 (0.98-0.99). Combining these results, the active oil vs. comparator oil hazard
ratio was 0.88 (0.84-0.93) in the CGPS mimicking REDUCE-IT compared to 0.75 (0.68-0.83) in the REDUCE-IT.
The corresponding hazard ratio was 0.96 (0.93-0.99) in the CGPS mimicking STRENGTH compared to 0.99
(0.90-1.09) in STRENGTH.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
The contrasting results of REDUCE-IT vs. STRENGTH can partly be explained by a difference in the effect of com-

parator oils (mineral vs. corn), but not of active oils [eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) vs. EPA th docosahexaenoic acid],
on lipid traits and C-reactive protein. The unexplained additional 13% risk reduction in REDUCE-IT likely is
through other effects of EPA or mineral oil.

Introduction
Recently, two double-blind randomized controlled trials have shown
contrasting results for the effect of high-dose, purified omega-3 fatty
acids for triglyceride lowering on the prevention of atherosclerotic
cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). In REDUCE-IT (Reduction of
Cardiovascular Events with Icosapent Ethyl-Intervention Trial)
including 8179 individuals at high ASCVD risk, administration of
4 g/day icosapent ethyl [an ethyl ester of eicosapentaenoic acid
(EPA)] compared to mineral oil for 4.9 years resulted in a 25% lower
risk of ASCVD.1 In contrast, in STRENGTH (Long-Term Outcomes
Study to Assess Statin Residual Risk with Epanova in High
Cardiovascular Risk Patients with Hypertriglyceridaemia) including
13 078 individuals at moderate-high ASCVD risk, administration of
4 g/day EPA (75%) plus docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 25%) compared

to corn oil for 3.5 years had no beneficial effect on the risk of
ASCVD.2,3 Thus, these two trials differed with respect to active oils
(EPA vs. EPA th DHA), comparator oils (mineral vs. corn), and study
populations (high vs. moderate-high risk).
In both REDUCE-IT and STRENGTH, active and comparator oils
independently had different effects on triglyceride-rich lipoproteins
(marked by plasma triglycerides), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and low-grade inflammation (marked by plasma C-reactive
protein) (Supplementary material online, Table S1),1,2 all three causally related to the risk of ASCVD.4-9 Triglyceride-rich lipoproteins together with LDL [which includes lipoprotein(a)] can be summarized
as non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL) cholesterol or apolipoprotein B, both of which were also reported in REDUCE-IT and
STRENGTH. A better understanding of the contrasting results in
REDUCE-IT vs. STRENGTH may thus emerge through examining

Explanations for contrasting results of REDUCE-IT vs. STRENGTH using a cohort study mimicking trial designs. We tested the hypothesis that contrasting
results in REDUCE-IT vs. STRENGTH can be explained by differences in the effect of active oils (eicosapentaenoic acid vs. eicosapentaenoic acid th docosahexaenoic acid) and comparator oils (mineral vs. corn) on lipid traits and C-reactive protein, or in study populations (high vs. moderate-high risk). To do
so, we used the CGPS to mimic the study populations of REDUCE-IT and STRENGTH and followed them for 4.9 and 3.5 years, respectively, for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events, corresponding to the median follow-up time of the two trials.1,2 Combination of percent change in plasma triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and C-reactive protein in the active oil arm, the comparator oil arm, and between arm difference reported in
REDUCE-IT1 or STRENGTH2 (Supplementary material online, Table S1) were examined in (A) the CGPS mimicking REDUCE-IT, or (B) the CGPS mimicking STRENGTH. The hazard ratios for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease are shown in blue dots for active oil arms, yellow dots for comparator oil
arms, and light green dots for between arm differences. The dark green dots represent the actual hazard ratios for risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular
disease as reported in REDUCE-IT1 or STRENGTH.2 ASCVD, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; CGPS, Copenhagen General Population Study;

Possible explanation REDUCE-IT vs. STRENGTH

Methods
Study population
The CGPS recruited in 2003-15 individuals aged 20-100 invited randomly from the Danish Civil Registration System (43% participation rate).
Information on lifestyle and medication including statin therapy was
obtained through a questionnaire. Furthermore, participants underwent
a physical examination and had non-fasting blood samples drawn for biochemical measurements.10 We used 106 088 eligible individuals with full
baseline information on all lipid traits (triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, nonHDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein B) and C-reactive protein.
For the present study, we included individuals based on key inclusion
criteria used in REDUCE-IT and STRENGTH, referred to as the CGPS
mimicking REDUCE-IT and the CGPS mimicking STRENGTH, respectively. For the CGPS mimicking REDUCE-IT, we selected individuals on
statins at study entry, who were (i) >_45 years with established ASCVD or
(ii) >_50 years with diabetes and at least one additional risk factor including
high age (>_55 years for men or >_65 years for women), current smoking,
hypertension, renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance between 30 and
60 mL/min calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault equation), or anklebrachial index <0.9.1 For the CGPS mimicking STRENGTH, we selected
individuals on statins at study entry, who (i) had established ASCVD,
(ii) had diabetes and were >_40 years for men or >_50 years for women
with at least one additional risk factor including current smoking and
hypertension, or (iii) did not have diabetes but were >_50 years for men
or >_60 years for women with at least one additional risk factor including
family history of premature coronary artery disease, current smoking, or
renal dysfunction (estimated glomerular filtration rate <45 mL/min/
1.73 m2 calculated by the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology
Collaboration equation).2 We did not exclude individuals with plasma triglycerides <1.52 mmol/L (135 mg/dL) in the CGPS mimicking REDUCEIT and <2.03 mmol/L (180 mg/dL) in the CGPS mimicking STRENGTH
because we need individuals with both high and low triglycerides in the
CGPS to mimic the two trial designs for untreated and treated participants, respectively; however, in the sensitivity analysis, we excluded individuals with such low triglycerides.
In another sensitivity analysis, we further used the inclusion criteria
from REDUCE-IT of LDL cholesterol between 1.06 and 2.59 mmol/L (41
and 100 mg/dL) and from STRENGTH of (i) LDL cholesterol
<2.59 mmol/L (<100 mg/dL) and (ii) HDL cholesterol <1.09 mmol/L

(<42 mg/dL) for men or <1.22 mmol/L (<47 mg/dL) for women.
Individuals with triglycerides >5.7 mmol/L (>500 mg/dL) or C-reactive
protein >200 mg/L (>20 mg/dL) were excluded as these individuals represent extreme outliers, potentially at risk of other diseases than
ASCVD.
Written informed consent was given by each participant. The study
was approved by an institutional review board and a Danish Ethical
Committee (H-KF-01-144/01). The study was conducted according to
the Declaration of Helsinki.

Lipids traits and high-sensitivity C-reactive
protein
Plasma total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein
B, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein were measured at baseline using
standard hospital assay from Konelab, Helsinki, Finland or Roche, Basel,
Switzerland. When triglycerides were <4 mmol/L (<354 mg/dL), LDL
cholesterol was calculated by the Friedewald equation,11 and otherwise
measured directly. Non-HDL cholesterol was total cholesterol minus
HDL cholesterol. Changes in these parameters were identified directly
from the original trials (Supplementary material online, Methods and
Supplementary material online, Tables S1 and S2).

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease
We defined ASCVD using the definition of the primary outcome in
REDUCE-IT and STRENGTH.1,2 Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease
included cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal
stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina, and coronary revascularization. Information on ASCVD was collected until 13 December 2018 by
reviewing the national Danish Causes of Death Registry and all hospital
admissions and diagnoses entered in the Danish National Patient Registry
[World Health Organization International Classification of Diseases, 10th
edition (ICD-10) codes I01-I99 for cardiovascular death, I21-I22 for
myocardial infarction, I60-I61, I63-I64, and G45 for stroke, and I20.0 for
unstable angina], and coronary revascularization registered according to
the Nordic Medico-Statistical Committee (NOMESCO) Classification of
Surgical Procedures as coronary artery bypass graft (NOMESCO:
KFNA-KFNE) and percutaneous coronary intervention (NOMESCO:
KFNG00-05). In the Danish health registries, myocardial infarction is
more than 99% correct,12 stroke events were individually validated,13 and
invasive procedures are registered accurately,14 while the accuracy of
registration for cardiovascular death and unstable angina is likely less
precise.

Statistical analyses
We used Stata version 15.1 SE (Stata Corp., College Station, TX, USA).
Covariates for adjustment were chosen due to known associations with
ASCVD, including age, sex, smoking status (current or former/never
smoker), and systolic blood pressure. Body mass index, diabetes mellitus,
and HDL cholesterol were deliberately omitted as covariates for adjustment because these covariates influence lipid traits and/or C-reactive
protein through biological pathways; increasing body mass index and diabetes mellitus lead to increased plasma triglycerides and C-reactive protein, while HDL cholesterol levels are inversely related to plasma
triglycerides.15 However, these three variables were included in the sensitivity analysis. Missing information on covariates (0.1%) for adjustment
was imputed; for continuous variables by regression based on age and
sex, while categorical variables were assigned a separate category.
However, if only individuals with complete data were included, results
were similar.
We used Cox proportional hazards regressions with age as the underlying timescale, study entry at baseline examination (left truncation), and

different effects on lipid traits and C-reactive protein within the two
trials.
We tested the hypothesis that contrasting results in REDUCE-IT
vs. STRENGTH can be explained by differences in effect of active oils
(EPA vs. EPA th DHA) and comparator oils (mineral vs. corn) on lipid
traits and C-reactive protein, or in study populations (high vs. moderate-high risk). To do so, we used the Copenhagen General
Population Study (CGPS) to mimic the study populations of
REDUCE-IT and STRENGTH and followed them for 4.9 and
3.5 years, respectively, for ASCVD events, corresponding to the median follow-up time of the two trials.1,2 Within these two cohorts, we
then examined the difference in ASCVD incidence that could be
explained by study-specific observed changes in triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, LDL, and low-grade inflammation within each study arm
(active and comparator oil) separately and combined,1,2 as well as between study populations. Finally, we compared these estimated
changes in ASCVD risk with corresponding observed changes in
REDUCE-IT and STRENGTH.

Results
In 106 088 eligible individuals in the CGPS, 5684 fulfilled the key inclusion criteria for REDUCE-IT (the CGPS mimicking REDUCE-IT) and
6862 for STRENGTH (the CGPS mimicking STRENGTH) (Table 1).

In the EPA arm of REDUCE-IT, a median -20% change in triglycerides,
-1% change in LDL cholesterol, and -14% change in C-reactive protein were observed during the study period (Supplementary material
online, Table S1).1 In the CGPS mimicking REDUCE-IT, the hazard
ratios [95% confidence interval (CI)] for ASCVD were 0.97 (95% CI
0.95-1.00) for -20% change in triglycerides, 1.00 (1.00-1.00) for -1%
change in LDL cholesterol, and 0.97 (0.96-0.98) for -14% change in
C-reactive protein (upper estimate of Figure 1A). When combining
these three changes, the hazard ratio was 0.96 (0.93-0.99) in the
CGPS mimicking REDUCE-IT (upper estimate of Figure 2A).
In the EPA th DHA arm of STRENGTH, a median -19% change in
triglycerides, th1% change in LDL cholesterol, and -20% change in Creactive protein were observed during the study period
(Supplementary material online, Table S1).2 In the CGPS mimicking
STRENGTH, the corresponding hazard ratios for ASCVD were 0.97
(95% CI 0.94-1.00), 1.00 (1.00-1.00), and 0.96 (0.95-0.98), respectively (upper estimate of Figure 1B). When combining these three
changes, the hazard ratio was 0.94 (0.91-0.98) in the CGPS mimicking STRENGTH (upper estimate of Figure 2B).

death, or end of follow-up (4.9 years for the CGPS mimicking REDUCEIT, 3.5 years for the CGPS mimicking STRENGTH, and 9.1 years for the
entire CGPS), whichever came first. On continuous scales, restricted
cubic splines with three knots (best fit according to the Akaike information criteria) were applied for all models, with the reference value as the
mean of the top quartile in all splines. When analysing the association between percent difference in lipid traits or C-reactive protein levels with
the risk of ASCVD, we used a log scale to make a one-unit change correspond to a percent difference, e.g. when analysing the association between
20% lower triglycerides and risk of ASCVD, we used a 0.8 log scale,
where a one-unit change corresponds to a 20% lower level. When three
changes were combined (e.g. triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, and C-reactive protein), the markers were assumed to act independently on the outcome. The assumption of proportional hazards was tested using
Schoenfeld residuals; no major deviations were observed.

Impact of lipids traits and C-reactive
protein on atherosclerotic cardiovascular
disease
As expected, lower levels of plasma triglycerides, LDL cholesterol,
non-HDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, and C-reactive protein were
all associated with lower risk of ASCVD (Supplementary material online, Figure S10). Due to less statistical power, the 95% CI for hazard
ratios were naturally wider in the CGPS mimicking REDUCE-IT and
the CGPS mimicking STRENGTH than in the entire CGPS.

Discussion
In 5684 and 6862 individuals fulfilling key inclusion criteria of
REDUCE-IT (the CGPS mimicking REDUCE-IT) and STRENGTH
(the CGPS mimicking STRENGTH), the surprising difference in
results between REDUCE-IT and STRENGTH can partly be
explained by different effect of comparator oils (mineral vs. corn) on
lipid traits and C-reactive protein while effect of different active oils
(EPA vs. EPA th DHA) on lipid traits and C-reactive protein and different study populations (high vs. moderate-high risk) could not explain the different results (Graphical Abstract).
Our approach takes the effects of active and comparator oils on
lipid traits and C-reactive protein exactly as observed in the two trials1,2 and insert them in regression models for the risk of ASCVD
using the CGPS. In other words, we estimate what changes in risk of
ASCVD can be explained by the observed effects on lipid traits and
C-reactive protein by active oils and comparator oils. Importantly,
our approach does not exclude other possible effects of active and
comparator oils on ASCVD unrelated to lipid traits and C-reactive
protein. Indeed, in REDUCE-IT, through changes in lipid traits and Creactive protein, we could only account for 12% of the observed 25%
lower risk of ASCVD. Therefore, the unexplained additional 13% risk
reduction in REDUCE-IT likely is through other beneficial effects of
EPA, or deleterious effects of mineral oil. EPA may have effects on
other ASCVD risk factors like blood pressure, platelet activation, oxidative stress, inflammation, endothelial function, plaque phenotype,
and lipid levels and metabolism not accounted for, which may delay

the onset of atherosclerosis and the clinical sequelae associated with
acute plaque rupture.16-18 In support of this idea, in REDUCE-IT
when adjusting for differences between treatment arms in triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, and C-reactive protein, the point estimate of
the treatment effect did not change substantially.19 Also the results
from the EVAPORATE (Effect of Vascepa on Improving Coronary
Atherosclerosis in People With High Triglycerides Taking Statin
Therapy) study, which is a coronary arterial plaque assessment trial
comparing high-dose purified EPA plus statins vs. mineral oil plus statins, showed slightly regressed coronary artery plaques in the EPA
plus statin group.20 These observations together support the possibility that effects of EPA beyond reducing lipid traits and C-reactive protein may explain other parts of the risk difference between the EPA
and mineral oil arms in the REDUCE-IT trial. That said, we cannot exclude that the unexplained additional 13% risk reduction in
REDUCE-IT could represent a chance finding.
Mechanistically, the higher estimated risk of ASCVD in the
REDUCE-IT mineral oil arm compared to the STRENGTH corn oil
arm is likely explained by the different changes in causal risk factors
for ASCVD, that is, triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (marked by plasma
triglycerides), LDL cholesterol, and low-grade inflammation (marked
by plasma C-reactive protein).4-9 Indeed, in the REDUCE-IT mineral
oil arm, LDL cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein B,
and C-reactive protein were all elevated at the end of the study
period. In contrast, such changes were minimal in the STRENGTH
corn oil arm, even with a trend towards potential protection against
ASCVD due to lower C-reactive protein. Surprisingly, changes in the
three causal risk factors lead to similar estimated reduced risk of
ASCVD in the active oil groups of EPA in REDUCE-IT and of
EPA th DHA in STRENGTH. Taken together, increased lipid traits
and C-reactive protein may account for increased risk of ASCVD in
the mineral oil arm of REDUCE-IT, explaining part of the contrasting
results of REDUCE-IT vs. STRENGTH.
One possible explanation of the elevation in lipid traits and C-reactive protein in the mineral oil arm of REDUCE-IT is an inhibited absorption of statins.21 Mineral oil, which is composed of higher alkanes
distilled from petroleum, is hardly absorbable in the human gastrointestinal tract and is considered safe in small amounts by the US
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and by the European Food
Safety Authority (EFSA).22,23 However, as mineral oil interfered with
the absorption of lipophilic vitamin A,24 statins might likewise be less
absorbed and therefore in the REDUCE-IT mineral oil arm lead to
higher levels of lipid traits and consequently higher C-reactive protein. Also, as mineral oil is used as a mild laxative,21 mineral oil may
lead to larger loss of ingested statins via stools and in consequence
lower blood statin levels. Finally, it is not possible to exclude that
some mineral oil was absorbed in the intestine leading to deleterious
effects including elevated C-reactive protein within the body.25 In
support, in the ANCHOR [Effect of AMR101 (Ethyl Icosapentate) on
Triglyceride Levels in Patients on Statins With High Triglycerides
Levels (>_200 and <500 mg/dL)] and MARINE [Efficacy and Safety of
AMR101 (Ethyl Icosapentate) in Patients With Fasting Triglyceride
Levels >_500 and <_2000 mg/dL] studies in statin-treated patients, elevation of atherogenic lipoproteins (LDL cholesterol and/or non-HDL
cholesterol) and C-reactive protein in the group receiving mineral oil
was likewise observed.26,27 Further, in the EVAPORATE study, coronary plaque progression was found in the mineral oil group.20 These

similar to the former results, but with wider 95% CIs due to smaller
study population and therefore lower statistical power (compare
Supplementary material online, Figures S1 and S2 with Figures 1 and
2); baseline characteristics of these cohorts are shown in
Supplementary material online, Table S3. In addition, after additionally
applying LDL cholesterol inclusion criteria in REDUCE-IT to the
CGPS mimicking REDUCE-IT and LDL and HDL cholesterol inclusion criteria in STRENGTH to the CGPS mimicking STRENGTH
(Supplementary material online, Table S4), the results were also similar (compare Supplementary material online, Figures S3 and S4 with
Figures 1 and 2). When analyses were additionally adjusted for body
mass index, diabetes, and HDL cholesterol levels, the results were
similar (compare Supplementary material online, Figures S5 and S6
with Figures 1 and 2). Finally, when we used changes in lipid traits and
C-reactive protein on absolute scales (Supplementary material online, Table S2) rather than percent difference (Supplementary material online, Table S1), results were similar (compare Supplementary
material online, Figures S7-S9 with Figures 1-3).

Furthermore, in meta-regression, a dose-dependent risk reduction
was found for EPA, while DHA was associated with non-fatal myocardial infarction at low, but not at high doses. Interestingly, in bivariate meta-regression including both EPA and DHA, EPA but not DHA
conferred a reduced risk for non-fatal myocardial infarction (P = 0.05
vs. P = 0.48). Such findings32 together with results from REDUCE-IT1
support European guideline recommendations to consider use of
omega-3 fatty acids (icosapent ethyl 2  2 g/day) in combination with
a statin in high-risk (or above) patients with triglyceride levels between 1.5 and 5.6 mmol/L (135-499 mg/dL) despite statin
treatment.33
In conclusion, contrasting results of REDUCE-IT vs. STRENGTH
may partly be explained by different effects of comparator oils (mineral vs. corn) on lipid traits and C-reactive protein. This topic is of
high clinical relevance, given the uncertainty of the diverging results
from REDUCE-IT vs. STRENGTH and the question whether EPA
should be recommended as an adjunct to optimal guideline-based
therapy for the prevention of ASCVD in patients with hypertriglyceridaemia. Randomized controlled trials comparing EPA vs.
EPA th DHA, or vs. corn oil for the assessment of ASCVD prevention
are warranted.

effects on lipid traits and C-reactive protein by mineral oil may thus
have led to progression of coronary artery plaques and thereby
increased risk of ASCVD in the REDUCE-IT mineral oil arm, accounting for part of the 'beneficial effect' between the EPA and mineral oil
arms in REDUCE-IT.
Both LDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B decreased in the
REDUCE-IT between arm difference,1 while LDL cholesterol
increased slightly and apolipoprotein B decreased minimally in the
STRENGTH between arm difference.2 Moreover, in the
STRENGTH EPA th DHA arm, LDL cholesterol levels increased,
while apolipoprotein B decreased.2 In individuals with diabetes, LDL
cholesterol is often not elevated as opposed to apolipoprotein B
explained by elevated triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. When individuals
with diabetes are commenced on EPA and DHA, which decrease
hepatic de novo lipogenesis, LDL particles become larger, more cholesterol enriched, and triglyceride depleted resulting in increased LDL
cholesterol and decreased apolipoprotein B levels.7,28 Therefore, because apolipoprotein B tracks the risk of ASCVD better than LDL
cholesterol in individuals on statin,29 it seems plausible that the risk of
ASCVD was estimated to be lowered even in CGPS mimicking
STRENGTH in which LDL cholesterol levels increased slightly.
Based on data from REDUCE-IT, it has previously been estimated
that the increase in LDL cholesterol of 0.22 mmol/L (9 mg/dL) in the
mineral oil arm could explain a 3% increased risk of ASCVD,30,31
which is exactly what we observed in the CGPS mimicking REDUCEIT (Supplementary material online, Figure S7A, middle estimate).
However, when we examined the combined influence of 0.22 mmol/
L (10%) higher LDL cholesterol and 0.5 mg/L (32%) higher C-reactive
protein, we estimated that the risk of ASCVD would be higher by 7%
(Supplementary material online, Figure S8A, middle estimate).
Strengths of our study include (i) high number of individuals fulfilling key inclusion criteria of REDUCE-IT and STRENGTH, (ii) large
availability of relevant data, (iii) inclusion of individuals from a general
population setting, (iv) endpoints obtained from nationwide Danish
health registries, and (v) no individuals lost to follow-up. Potential limitations include that (i) exact statin doses during follow-up were unknown, (ii) use of non-fasting lipid profiles, (iii) we only included
white individuals of Danish descent, (iv) lipid changes reported in
REDUCE-IT and STRENGTH trials were evaluated over time, while
in the CGPS only baseline lipid values were analysed, (v) baseline
characteristics were somewhat different between the target populations in REDUCE-IT and STRENGTH and the CGPS mimicking populations regarding parameters such as age, sex, and individuals with
diabetes, and (vi) the use and adherence to medications that could affect the outcomes were not taken into consideration in the CGPS;
however, such differences will affect the results from the two mimicking studies equally. Ideally, we should also have adjusted for other
potential effects of EPA like on endothelial function and platelet activation; however, such information was not available in the CGPS.
Finally, total ASCVD events in CGPS mimicking REDUCE-IT and
STRENGTH were slightly lower than those in REDUCE-IT and
STRENGTH; however, in the entire CGPS with 11- to 14-fold more
ASCVD events, results were similar.
A recent meta-analysis including randomized trials of any omega-3
fatty acids with minimal 500 patients and at least 1-year follow-up
(including REDUCE-IT and STRENGTH) found an odds ratio for
non-fatal myocardial infarction of 0.91 (95% CI 0.83-0.99).32
