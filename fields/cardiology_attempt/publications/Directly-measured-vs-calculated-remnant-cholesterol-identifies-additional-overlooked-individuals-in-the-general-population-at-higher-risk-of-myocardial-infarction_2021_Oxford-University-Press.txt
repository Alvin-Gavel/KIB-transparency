Aims

We tested the hypothesis that high directly measured remnant cholesterol is associated with increased risk of ischaemic heart disease (IHD) and myocardial infarction (MI) in the general population. We also explored whether
directly measured vs. calculated remnant cholesterol is superior in identifying individuals at increased risk.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Overall, 16 207 individuals from the Copenhagen General Population Study with both directly measured and calcuMethods
lated remnant cholesterol, both representing cholesterol content in triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, were followed
and results

up for 14 years to analyse the risk for IHD and MI. For directly measured and calculated remnant cholesterol, hazard ratios for individuals with concentrations >_95th percentile vs. <40th percentile were 1.75 (95% confidence
interval 1.42-2.15) and 1.76 (1.42-2.17) for IHD and 2.05 (1.50-2.80) and 1.93 (1.40-2.66) for MI. Compared to
individuals with both directly measured and calculated remnant cholesterol <80th percentile (75% of the whole
population), those with only directly measured remnant cholesterol >_80th percentile (5%) had hazard ratios of
1.42 (1.15-1.75) for IHD and 1.83 (1.35-2.47) for MI. Corresponding hazard ratios for individuals with only calculated remnant cholesterol >_80th percentile (5%) were 1.14 (0.91-1.44) and 1.14 (0.80-1.62), respectively, and corresponding hazard ratios for individuals with both directly measured and calculated remnant cholesterol >_80th percentiles (15%) were 1.48 (1.30-1.68) and 1.67 (1.38-2.01), respectively. In individuals with high directly measured
or high calculated remnant cholesterol, the median directly measured remnant cholesterol was 1.9 and 1.5 mmol/L,
the median plasma triglycerides were 2.0 and 2.7 mmol/L, and the median plasma apolipoprotein B was 132 and
142 mg/dL, respectively.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusions
Directly measured vs. calculated remnant cholesterol identifies 5% overlooked individuals in the general population
with cholesterol-rich, triglyceride-poor remnants and 1.8-fold increased risk of MI.

Introduction
Previous studies found associations between high concentrations
of calculated remnant cholesterol and increased risk of cardiovascular disease,1 and genetic studies indicated that the association is
causal.2-4 In addition, emerging evidence from randomized clinical trials shows benefit from lowering triglycerides,5 which are highly
correlated to remnant cholesterol concentrations as they are constituents of the same triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, known as remnants.2
A newly developed assay by Denka allows direct measurement of
remnant cholesterol (i.e. cholesterol content in triglyceride-rich lipoproteins; TRL-C assay), but whether this is superior for risk prediction to calculating remnant cholesterol is unknown.
Remnant cholesterol can be calculated from a standard lipid profile
as total cholesterol minus low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol
minus high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol.1,6 Remnant cholesterol is the cholesterol content of the triglyceride-rich lipoproteins
called remnants, which include chylomicron remnants, very lowdensity lipoproteins (VLDL), and intermediate-density lipoproteins
(IDL). It is an advantage that calculated remnant cholesterol can be
derived from a standard lipid profile at no extra cost; however, it also

has the limitation that when using the Friedewald equation to estimate LDL cholesterol and thus remnant cholesterol, a fixed ratio between triglycerides and VLDL cholesterol is assumed throughout
most levels of plasma triglycerides. The ratio between triglycerides
and cholesterol in remnant particles will differ somewhat between
individuals, and also within the same individual at different time
points. This can be mitigated partly by calculating remnant cholesterol using LDL cholesterol that is estimated without assuming a fixed
ratio between triglycerides and VLDL cholesterol as done by Martin
et al.,7 or fully by using a direct assay that measures the cholesterol
content in remnants.
Until recently, remnant cholesterol, defined as the cholesterol
content in the blood stream that is not in LDL or HDL, could not be
measured directly using an assay on an autoanalyzer suited for highvolume production in a hospital laboratory, but could only be measured by more laborious methods like ultracentrifugation or nuclear
magnetic resonance spectroscopy.6 If results from the present study
show added benefit of measuring remnant cholesterol directly besides calculating it, this new assay opens up for broader use for risk
prediction. The assay was designed to measure the cholesterol content of all lipoproteins that are not HDL or LDL, that is remnants or

Methods
The study was approved by the Herlev and Gentofte Hospital and the
Danish ethics committees (H-KF-01-144) and was conducted according
to the Declaration of Helsinki. All individuals provided written informed
consent and were whites of Danish descent.

The Copenhagen General Population Study
The Copenhagen General Population Study is a prospective cohort study
of individuals randomly selected from the adult Danish general population, aged 20-100 years. The first examination covered the period from
2003 to 2016, and the second examination, including participants from
the first examination and new participants living in the same geographical
area, was initiated in 2016 and is ongoing. Individuals filled in a questionnaire, underwent a physical examination, and had blood samples drawn at
study inclusion. Information on directly measured remnant cholesterol
was available for 17 237 individuals recruited in 2003-2010; of these,
1030 were diagnosed with IHD and 439 with MI before baseline and
were excluded from prospective analyses. Participants included were
recruited consecutively ensuring that time of freezing was similar for
those who did and did not develop MI and IHD during follow-up.

IHD and MI
Information on diagnoses of IHD (ICD8: 410-414; ICD10: I20-I25) and
MI (ICD8: 410; ICD10: I21-I22) were obtained from the national Danish
Patient Registry and the national Danish Causes of Death Registry from
register start in 1977 to end of follow-up in April 2018. All Danish citizens
are registered in the national registers, and follow-up is therefore without
losses.

Laboratory analyses
Standard hospital assays measured nonfasting plasma triglycerides, plasma
total cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol (Konelab or Roche). Calculated
remnant cholesterol was total cholesterol minus HDL cholesterol and
LDL cholesterol as done previously2,8,10-12 but with LDL cholesterol calculated using the method by Martin et al.7 where the ratio between triglycerides and VLDL cholesterol is dependent upon the plasma triglyceride
and non-HDL cholesterol levels. For all other purposes than for calculating remnant cholesterol, LDL cholesterol was calculated using the
Friedewald equation when triglycerides were <_4 mmol/L (352 mg/dL),
and otherwise measured directly (Konelab or Roche). Remnant

.. cholesterol was measured directly using a recently developed assay by
..
.. Denka (TRL-C) assay on the Cobas platform from Roche on samples
.. from individuals who participated in 2003-2010. Samples were stored at
..
.. -80 C from study inclusion to measurements performed in 2019. This
.. automated homogeneous assay uses a two-step process where LDL and
..
.. HDL are degraded and the cholesterol content of the remaining rem.. nants (triglyceride-rich lipoproteins) is measured. The assay is traceable
.. to cholesterol content in the ultracentrifugation density fraction
..
.. <1.019 g/mL containing in the nonfasting state chylomicron remnants,
.. VLDL, and IDL. For daily precision, average coefficient of variation was
..
.. below 7%. For comparison between direct measurements of remnant
.. cholesterol on fresh blood samples and on samples stored at -80 C, 101
.. samples originally measured on fresh blood samples were re-measured
..
.. after 2 years of storage.
..
..
.. Other covariates
.. Other covariates included baseline self-reported use of antihypertensive
..
.. therapy and lipid-lowering therapy (mainly statins), current or former
.. smoking habits, self-reported diagnosed diabetes, nonfasting glucose
..
.. >11 mmol/L, self-reported use of anti-diabetic medication, and/or regis.. ter information on hospitalization due to diabetes before baseline (ICD8:
.. 249-250; ICD10: E10, E11, E13, E14). Alcohol consumption was self..
.. reported as drinks/week (1 drink  12 g of alcohol). Body mass index
.. (BMI) was calculated by dividing body weight (in kg) by height in metre
..
.. squared.
..
..
.. Statistical analyses
.. First, individuals were divided into groups of percentiles of directly meas.. ured and calculated remnant cholesterol, so that the two could be com..
.. pared head-to-head as risk factors for IHD and MI. Hazard ratios for IHD
.. and MI were estimated by Cox proportional hazards regression using left
..
.. truncation and delayed entry, and with age as time-scale, which ensures
.. the optimal adjustment for age. Individuals with IHD or MI before baseline
..
.. were excluded from the analyses, and individuals were followed until first
.. event, death, emigration, or end of follow-up in April 2018. The median
.. follow-up time was 11 years (range 0-14 years). Besides age adjustment,
..
.. hazard ratios were adjusted for possible confounders, i.e. sex, systolic
.. and diastolic blood pressure, antihypertensive therapy, lipid-lowering
..
.. therapy, and smoking. The main analyses were not adjusted for covariates
.. in the biological pathway, including diabetes, alcohol consumption, and
.. BMI; however, this was performed in sensitivity analyses. Also, further ad..
.. justment for LDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B was performed in
.. sensitivity analyses.

..
The association between directly measured and calculated remnant

triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, and should not be mistaken with the
remnant-like particle cholesterol (RLP-C) assay8,9 that measures only
a subfraction of what we define as remnant cholesterol in the present
study.
In a previous study,10 we examined the association between calculated and directly measured remnant cholesterol using this new TRLC assay and found a high correlation between concentrations of the
two, but whether directly measured remnant cholesterol concentrations are associated with risk of ischaemic heart disease (IHD) and
myocardial infarction (MI) has not been explored previously by us.
In this prospective cohort study of 16 207 individuals from the
Copenhagen General Population Study, we tested the hypothesis
that high directly measured remnant cholesterol is associated with
increased risk of IHD and MI in the general population. We also
explored whether directly measured remnant cholesterol is superior
to calculated remnant cholesterol in identifying individuals at
increased risk of IHD and MI.

Results
The baseline characteristics of the 16 207 individuals without previous IHD or MI are reported in Table 1, including the four groups
based on <80th or >_80th percentile levels for directly measured and
calculated remnant cholesterol, both representing cholesterol content in triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. The group with only high directly measured remnant cholesterol had lower median apolipoprotein B
levels but higher levels of directly measured remnant cholesterol
than the group with only high calculated remnant cholesterol (132 vs.
142 mg/dL and 1.9 vs. 1.5 mmol/L, respectively). This suggests that
individuals in the former group likely have fewer remnant particles
but particles that are enriched in cholesterol.

Association of directly measured and
calculated remnant cholesterol with risk
of IHD and MI
When individuals were divided into groups with a focus on extreme
high levels for directly measured and calculated remnant cholesterol,
hazard ratios for individuals with concentrations >_95th percentile
vs. <40th percentile were 1.75 (95% CI 1.42-2.15) and 1.76 (1.42-
2.17) for IHD and 2.05 (1.50-2.80) and 1.93 (1.40-2.66) for MI
(Figure 1). Similar results were obtained when calculating remnant
cholesterol based on Friedewald-estimated LDL cholesterol instead
of using the method by Martin et al.7 (Supplementary material online,
Figure S1).
When multivariable adjusted hazard ratios were further adjusted
for LDL cholesterol (Supplementary material online, Figure S2) or
HDL cholesterol, BMI, diabetes, and alcohol intake (Supplementary
material online, Figure S3), associations between both directly measured and calculated remnant cholesterol and risk of IHD and MI
remained, although somewhat attenuated.

Association between directly measured
and calculated remnant cholesterol
The association between directly measured and calculated remnant
cholesterol was not perfectly linear but showed discordance especially at high concentrations (Figure 2).

Discordance on the risk of MI between
directly measured and calculated
remnant cholesterol
Because of the discordance in concentrations of directly measured
and calculated remnant cholesterol, the prospective risk of IHD and
MI was investigated in the four groups of individuals divided according
to: (i) low concentrations of both directly measured and calculated
remnant cholesterol (75% of the whole population), (ii) only high directly measured remnant cholesterol (5%), (iii) only high calculated
remnant cholesterol (5%), and (iv) high concentrations of both directly measured and calculated remnant cholesterol (15%) (Figure 3).
Compared to individuals with both directly measured and calculated
remnant cholesterol <80th percentile, those with only directly measured remnant cholesterol >_80th percentile had hazard ratios of 1.42
(95% CI 1.15-1.75) for IHD and 1.83 (1.35-2.47) for MI.
Corresponding hazard ratios for individuals with only calculated remnant cholesterol >_80th percentile were 1.14 (0.91-1.44) and 1.14
(0.80-1.62), and corresponding hazard ratios for individuals with
both directly measured and calculated remnant cholesterol >_80th
percentile were 1.48 (1.30-1.68) and 1.67 (1.38-2.01), respectively.
Results were similar when remnant cholesterol was calculated
using Friedewald-estimated LDL cholesterol instead of using the
method by Martin et al.7 (Supplementary material online, Figure S4).
When multivariable adjusted hazard ratios were further adjusted for
(i) LDL cholesterol, (ii) HDL cholesterol, BMI, diabetes, and alcohol
intake, or (iii) apolipoprotein B, the associations between only high
directly measured cholesterol and risk of MI remained, although
somewhat attenuated (Supplementary material online, Figure S5).
The increased risk of MI was robust for the group with only high
directly measured remnant cholesterol or with high concentrations
of both directly measured and calculated remnant cholesterol, when
stratified by other risk factors (Figure 4). The prospective risk of IHD
and MI was also investigated in individuals divided based on any discordance between directly measured and calculated remnant cholesterol estimated by a prediction ellipse (Supplementary material
online, Figure S6). Individuals with discordant vs. concordant concentrations (outside vs. within the ellipse) had hazard ratios for IHD and
MI of 1.46 (95% CI 1.18-1.81) and 1.57 (1.14-2.14), respectively
(Supplementary material online, Figure S7).

Triglycerides and apolipoprotein B
To further explore possible explanations for the discordance on the
risk of IHD and MI for only high directly measured vs. only high calculated remnant cholesterol, concentration distributions of directly
measured remnant cholesterol, plasma triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B for the four groups were plotted (Figure 5). In individuals with
only high directly measured or only high calculated remnant cholesterol, the median directly measured remnant cholesterol was 1.9
and 1.5 mmol/L, the median plasma triglycerides were 2.0 and
2.7 mmol/L, and the median plasma apolipoprotein B was 132 and
142 mg/dL, respectively. This illustrates that individuals with only high
directly measured remnant cholesterol have cholesterol-rich, triglyceride-poor remnant particles, while those with only high calculated
remnant cholesterol have cholesterol-poor, triglyceride-rich

Discordance on the risk of MI between apolipoprotein B and calculated remnant cholesterol was investigated using a similar approach.
Discordance between directly measured and calculated remnant cholesterol was also estimated by a prediction ellipse, and the risk of MI by Cox
proportional hazard regression models with individuals divided into
groups inside (reference) and outside the ellipse. The net reclassification
index for MI using the cut point of directly measured and calculated remnant cholesterol >_80th percentile was estimated (Supplementary material online, Methods), similarly to what previously done for lipoprotein(a).13
Comparison of directly measured remnant cholesterol in the same
individuals measured on both fresh samples and after 2 years of storage
at -80 C was performed using unadjusted linear regression and was
graphed as a fitted regression line with 95% confidence interval (CI).

triglyceride-rich remnant particles (Figure 5).
Discordance on the risk of MI between plasma apolipoprotein B
and calculated remnant cholesterol was also examined (Supplementary material online, Figure S8). An increased risk of IHD and MI was
observed for all three groups, that is (i) only apolipoprotein B >_80th
percentile, (ii) only calculated remnant cholesterol >_80th percentile,
and (iii) both apolipoprotein B and calculated remnant cholesterol
>_80th percentile, when compared to individuals with both <80th
percentile.

Remnant cholesterol and the metabolic
syndrome
In individuals with vs. without the metabolic syndrome, calculated
remnant cholesterol was 50% higher, whereas measured remnant
cholesterol was 78% higher (Supplementary material online,

Reclassification of MI risk by directly
measured and calculated remnant
cholesterol
Prediction of 10-year risk of MI was improved by adding directly
measured or calculated remnant cholesterol to a model including the
conventional risk factors, i.e. age, sex, systolic and diastolic blood
pressure, antihypertensive therapy, lipid-lowering therapy, and smoking (Figure 6). When using a cut point >_80th percentile for directly
measured or calculated remnant cholesterol, the net reclassification
index was 4.7% (1.4-8.0%; P = 0.006) and 7.5% (3.5-11.5%;
P < 0.001), respectively.

cholesterol were found to be much higher than calculated concentrations (Figure 2). To explore whether this could be due to storage at
-80 C for up to 14 years for the directly measured remnant cholesterol, 101 samples from the Copenhagen General Population Study
second examination in 2017, where remnant cholesterol was directly
measured on fresh samples, were re-measured after 2 years of
freezer storage (Supplementary material online, Figure S10). This confirmed that concentrations increase with freezing; however, the association was linear, so freezing does not change, which percentile
individuals are grouped into.

Discussion
In this prospective cohort study of 16 207 individuals from the
Danish general population, high concentrations of directly measured
remnant cholesterol are associated with higher risk of IHD and MI.
Furthermore, directly measured vs. calculated remnant cholesterol
identifies 5% overlooked individuals in the general population with
cholesterol-rich, triglyceride-poor remnants and 1.8-fold increased
risk of MI (Graphical abstract). This is the first study to investigate
whether measuring remnant cholesterol directly adds value to calculating remnant cholesterol, which so far has been the only method
applicable to high-volume testing. In the present study, both directly
measured and calculated remnant cholesterol aim to capture the
total cholesterol content in triglyceride-rich lipoproteins.
The aim of our study was not to search for the differences in cardiovascular risk that may exist based on different definitions of remnant cholesterol. Rather, it was to evaluate if directly measured vs.
calculated remnant cholesterol could identify a group of individuals
with cholesterol-rich remnants at increased risk of IHD and MI. This

is important because for calculated remnant cholesterol a constant
ratio of cholesterol in remnants to plasma triglycerides is assumed either throughout most levels of plasma triglycerides (Friedewald
equation) or at individual levels of plasma triglycerides and non-HDL
cholesterol (Martin equation7), which may not be the case for every
individual as demonstrated in the present study. Thus, although calculated and measured remnant cholesterol may carry a similar risk of
IHD and MI on a population basis, on an individual patient basis directly measured remnant cholesterol (cholesterol content in triglyceride-rich lipoproteins) appears to identify a group of high-risk
individuals who are overlooked when examining only calculated remnant cholesterol.
One reason to separately consider the remnant cholesterol portion of the atherogenic cholesterol is if it presents greater risk than
that of LDL cholesterol. To that end, in the Copenhagen General
Population Study, directly measured VLDL cholesterol (remnant
cholesterol) explained 50% of the risk of MI from elevated apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins, while LDL th IDL cholesterol only
explained 29%.14 Furthermore, in the same study, directly measured
VLDL cholesterol explained 40% of the excess risk of MI associated
with higher BMI, whereas LDL th IDL did not explain excess risk.15 In
support of this, in the PREDIMED trial population, elevated calculated
remnant cholesterol, but not LDL cholesterol, was associated with
cardiovascular outcomes in overweight and obese individuals.16
Taken together, remnant cholesterol may be a better marker of risk
for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease than LDL cholesterol, particularly in overweight and obese individuals.
Mechanistically, the most likely explanation behind the association
between high remnant cholesterol concentrations and increased risk
for IHD and MI is that the cholesterol content of the remnant particles accumulates in the arterial wall and causes atherosclerosis.1,4,17-20 Why there was a discordance on the risk of IHD and MI
between directly measured and calculated remnant cholesterol could
be explained by the direct assay (i) being the most accurate at higher
concentrations and (ii) performing better when measuring/estimating
the cholesterol content of the remnant particles, that is without being
affected by plasma triglycerides for calculations. Since it is likely that
triglyceride content per se is not atherogenic,14 measuring cholesterol
content directly seems optimal. However, this does not mean that
calculating remnant cholesterol is not useful, because it did associate
with high risk of IHD and MI at high concentrations, and correlated
well with the directly measured concentrations, with most individuals
with high directly measured remnant cholesterol also having high calculated remnant cholesterol. Also, the net reclassification index improvement was better for calculated than for directly measured
remnant cholesterol, that is with the conditions we choose; however,
such a finding needs to be confirmed in independent studies. This is
important as calculating remnant cholesterol can be done at no extra
cost from a standard lipid profile and can easily be used when direct
measurement is not feasible. We found similar results on the risk of
IHD and MI when using Friedewald-estimated LDL cholesterol or
the method by Martin et al.7 to calculate remnant cholesterol, indicating that both can be used depending on what the local laboratory
offers.
The group with only high directly measured remnant cholesterol
had lower levels of apolipoprotein B than the group with only high
calculated remnant cholesterol. This could be seen as a strange

Individuals were divided into four groups according to <80th or >_80th percentile of directly measured and calculated remnant cholesterol (both capturing cholesterol content in triglyceride-rich lipoproteins). Hazard ratios were from Cox proportional hazards regressions with multivariable adjustment for age (as underlying time-scale), sex, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, antihypertensive therapy, lipid-lowering therapy, and smoking. CI,

finding; however, it seems to us that individuals in the group with only
high directly measured remnant cholesterol have a lower number of
remnant particles particularly enriched in cholesterol, an enrichment
that most likely makes remnants to cause more atherosclerosis leading to an increased risk of IHD and MI. That cholesterol enrichment
of remnant lipoproteins results in accelerated atherosclerosis, and
premature IHD and MI is well known from the genetic condition of
remnant hyperlipidaemia (= dysbetalipoproteinaemia or type III
hyperlipidaemia). This underlines the clinical value of measuring cholesterol content directly, in addition to calculating it.
In line with our results, Duran et al.21 found an increased risk of MI
for higher levels of directly measured remnant cholesterol using the
same assay. Also, previous studies using calculated remnant cholesterol, or other assays measuring only a fraction of what we call remnant cholesterol in this study, have found associations with
cardiovascular disease.1,2,8,10-12,22-27 The TRL-C (directly measured
remnant cholesterol) assay by Denka used in this study is designed to
measure the cholesterol content of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins at

d < 1.019 g/mL, which makes it different from previous RLP-C assays
measuring only a subfraction of what we define as remnant cholesterol. We therefore find higher levels of directly measured remnant
cholesterol than previous studies using RLP-C assays.9,25-27 Our
study is the first to compare directly measured remnant cholesterol
using the Denka TRL-C assay with calculated remnant cholesterol for
estimating the risk of MI and IHD.
A strength of our study is the large number of individuals with
both direct and calculated measurements of remnant cholesterol,
enabling a head-to-head comparison. A limitation is that direct remnant cholesterol was not measured on fresh samples, and storage
time has increased concentrations. However, since the association
between concentrations in fresh and frozen samples in the same individuals was linear, dividing individuals into groups based on percentiles instead of absolute concentrations will ensure that individuals
with high concentrations are identified. Also, participants were
recruited consecutively ensuring that time of freezing was similar for
those who did and did not develop MI and IHD during follow-up. For

cholesterol. However, this does not detract from our finding that elevated measured remnant cholesterol identifies an overlooked group
of individuals in the general population at high risk of MI.
Also, a limitation is the inability of the observational study design
to determine causality, partly due to the possibility of residual confounding, even though multivariable adjustment was used in the analyses. Therefore, there is a need for future randomized clinical trials
to examine whether lowering directly measured remnant cholesterol
in individuals with high concentrations will reduce cardiovascular risk.
The recent REDUCE-IT trial5 showed a 25% lower risk of cardiovascular disease in the group receiving 4 g of icosapent ethyl daily, when
compared to placebo, both on top of statins. In that trial, individuals
with moderately elevated triglycerides (1.52-5.63 mmol/L) were
randomized to 4 g of icosapent ethyl daily or placebo, and were followed for a median of 4.9 years for assessing the occurrence of a
composite endpoint of cardiovascular disease. When triglycerides

are lowered, remnant cholesterol is also lowered since triglycerides
and remnant cholesterol are components of the same lipoproteins
and therefore are highly correlated. However, whether measuring
remnant cholesterol directly to identify individuals for inclusion in a
randomized trial would translate into even better risk reduction is
unknown. This could be hypothesized from our results where a
group of individuals at high risk of IHD and MI were overlooked
based on calculated remnant cholesterol concentrations (and therefore would also be overlooked using plasma triglycerides) but were
identified using the direct assay. Fortunately, the ongoing
PROMINENT trial28 also aimed at reducing cardiovascular disease
through a reduction in triglyceride-rich lipoproteins is currently testing the direct remnant cholesterol (TRL-C) assay from Denka in all
participants.
In conclusion, high concentrations of both directly measured and
calculated remnant cholesterol are associated with higher risk of IHD
and MI. Furthermore, directly measured vs. calculated remnant cholesterol identifies 5% overlooked individuals in the general population
with cholesterol-rich, triglyceride-poor remnants and 1.8-fold
increased risk of MI.
