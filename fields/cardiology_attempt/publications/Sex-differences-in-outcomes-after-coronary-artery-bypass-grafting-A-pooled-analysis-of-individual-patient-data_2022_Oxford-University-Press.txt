Aims

Data suggest that women have worse outcomes than men after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), but results
have been inconsistent across studies. Due to the large differences in baseline characteristics between sexes, suboptimal risk adjustment due to low-quality data may be the reason for the observed differences. To overcome this limitation, we undertook a systematic review and pooled analysis of high-quality individual patient data from large CABG trials to compare the adjusted outcomes of women and men.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods and The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and repeat revascularization
(major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events, MACCE). The secondary outcome was all-cause mortality. Multivariable
results
mixed-effect Cox regression was used. Four trials involving 13 193 patients (10 479 males; 2714 females) were included. Over
5 years of follow-up, women had a significantly higher risk of MACCE [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.12, 95% confidence interval
(CI) 1.04-1.21; P = 0.004] but similar mortality (adjusted HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.94-1.14; P = 0.51) compared to men. Women had
higher incidence of MI (adjusted HR 1.30, 95% CI 1.11-1.52) and repeat revascularization (adjusted HR 1.22, 95% CI 1.04-1.43)
but not stroke (adjusted HR 1.17, 95% CI 0.90-1.52). The difference in MACCE between sexes was not significant in patients
75 years and older. The use of off-pump surgery and multiple arterial grafting did not modify the difference between sexes.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusions Women have worse outcomes than men in the first 5 years after CABG. This difference is not significant in patients
aged over 75 years and is not affected by the surgical technique.

CABG o Sex o Women

Introduction
Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is the most commonly performed cardiac surgery procedure in adults.1 In the USA, every year
200 000 patients undergo CABG and of them between 25% and
30% are women.2
Registries and chart review studies have reported worse early and
late outcomes for women compared to men after CABG,3,4 although
this finding has not been consistent in all the published series.5,6
It is well known that there are key differences in baseline clinical characteristics and in the type and extent of coronary artery disease between men and women referred for CABG.5,7 A critical part of any
comparison of the CABG outcomes of men and women is the adjustment for this high baseline heterogeneity. Clinical charts and registries
have important limitations in terms of granularity and quality of the data,
and adjusted estimates based on those datasets have high risk of residual
bias and unmeasured confounders. Randomized controlled trials
(RCTs) minimize heterogeneity by including only a selected subgroup of
the general population and have higher data quality. It is likely that the effectiveness of statistical adjustment and the chances of detecting true
sex-related differences are maximized when using RCT-derived data.

..
However, the proportion of women enrolled in RCTs in cardio..
.. vascular medicine is low8 and individual trials are underpowered to
..
.. explore sex-related differences in outcomes.
..
To overcome these limitations, we performed a systematic review
..
.. and pooled analysis of the individual patient data from the largest

..

Selection of the trials

Data collection and merging
After identification of eligible trials, the individual trials' teams were contacted and all agreed to data sharing. Detailed specifications of core minimum de-identified data requirements were provided to each trial team.
De-identified data were received by the coordinating centre at Weill
Cornell Medicine and checked for quality, completion, and consistency
with previous publications. Data were checked for missing values, intrafield data integrity, and inter-field inconsistencies both within each RCT
and across the RCTs. Discrepancies were resolved through direct consultation with the individual trials' teams. Data elements were then consolidated into a final database. The list of the variables collected in each
trial is provided in Supplementary material online, Table S1.

Outcomes
The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause mortality, any myocardial infarction (MI), any stroke, and any repeat revascularization (major
adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events, MACCE). The secondary
outcome was all-cause mortality. The tertiary outcomes were a composite of death and stroke and operative mortality, defined as death in hospital or within 30 days after surgery. Each individual non-fatal component
of the composite outcome was also evaluated separately. For all events,
individual trial definitions were used (details are in Supplementary material online, Table S2). All endpoints were compared by sex groups.

Statistical analysis
Baseline and intraoperative characteristics in the two groups were
reported as numbers and percentages for categorical variables. For continuous variables normality was assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test and
data reported as means and standard deviations or median and interquartile range as appropriate. Parametric or non-parametric tests were used
to compare the two groups, based on normality. Outcomes were
reported as frequencies and cumulative incidence. For non-fatal events
the cumulative incidence was determined with all-cause mortality as a
competing risk using Fine and Gray11 proportional sub-hazards model.

Primary analysis
In the primary analysis, association between treatment and outcomes
was estimated using a multivariable mixed-effect Cox regression model,
with individual trials as a random effect, and baseline risk factors and

surgical techniques as fixed terms. Fixed terms included in the multivariable models were all baseline and operative variables consistently
reported across trials, which included: sex, age, diabetes, previous MI, left
ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <50%, renal insufficiency (serum creatinine >200 lmol/L), body mass index (BMI), New York Heart
Association (NYHA) Class III-IV, peripheral vascular disease (PVD),
previous stroke, previous percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI),
off- or on-pump surgery, number of arterial grafts used (no arterial
grafts, SAG: single arterial graft, and MAG: multiple arterial grafts), and
total number of grafts. The proportional hazards assumption was verified using Schoenfeld residuals. Missing preoperative data were all
<0.1% of the total and were imputed with median or mode values for
continuous and categorical variables, respectively (Supplementary
material online, Figure S1).
Treatment effects were presented as hazard ratios (HRs) and 95%
confidence intervals (CIs). Subgroup analysis and interaction terms were
used to investigate the following potential sex effect modifiers in the primary analysis: age, diabetes, previous MI, LVEF, number of grafts, and surgical techniques (off- vs. on-pump and MAG vs. SAG). Non-linearity for
the interaction between age and sex was assessed using spline analysis
and model v2 comparison. The cut-off point for age was identified as the
intercept between two curves obtained by contrasting adjusted relative
risk in the two groups against age.
The effect of sex on the primary endpoint was also calculated using a
two-stage approach pooling b coefficients and relative standard error
obtained from individual study multivariable Cox regression models.
Meta-analytic estimates were obtained using a generic inverse variance
method with a random effects model. Trial-level and pooled estimates
were reported as HRs and 95% CIs. Heterogeneity across trials was
assessed using I2 statistics. I2 values <25% defined low heterogeneity, 25-
50% moderate heterogeneity, and >50% high heterogeneity. Leave-oneout analysis was used to assess the influence of individual trials on the
pooled estimate.
Two explanatory analyses not described in the original analysis plan9
were added post hoc:
(1)

(2)

A landmark analysis starting at 30 days after randomization for the
primary outcome. This analysis was adjusted using the same method
described for the primary analysis.
Age was explored as a modifier of the sex effect for the secondary
outcome of all-cause mortality.

Secondary analysis
In the secondary analysis, we investigated the effects of two important
CABG surgical techniques (off- vs. on-pump and MAG vs. SAG) on
the primary outcome by sex. To account for non-randomized treatment allocation, propensity scores (PS) for each of the two techniques were developed in women and men separately using a gradient
boosting machine logistic regression model. Variables included in the
PS were age, diabetes, previous MI, LVEF <50%, renal insufficiency,
BMI, NYHA Class III-IV, PVD, previous stroke, previous PCI, number
of grafts, number of arterial grafts (for the off- vs. on-pump comparison only), and off-pump surgery (for the MAG vs. SAG comparison
only). The individual trial identifier was included in the PS model to ensure a balance between subjects from each trial. The treatment effect
was evaluated using inverse probability of treatment weighting with
'average effect of the treatment on treated'. Standardized mean differences were used to assess the balance of covariates between the two
treatment groups. A value higher than 0.10 was considered as an indication of residual imbalance.

A systematic literature search was performed to identify all CABG RCTs
(i.e. RCTs where all patients underwent or were expected to undergo
CABG). Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and Cochrane Trials (Wiley)
were searched. The following keywords were used, in combination with
the Boolean operator 'or': 'CABG' and 'coronary artery bypass'. We
decided to include only CABG trials and to exclude trials comparing
CABG to other interventions to minimize the potential heterogeneity
related to the inclusion of patients who were acceptable candidates for
both surgical and non-surgical interventions. To minimize the small-study
effect,10 trials were considered for inclusion only if they had a sample size
>_400 patients. Additional inclusion criteria were that trials: (i) enrolled
both men and women, (ii) had a follow-up >_5 years, and (iii) were written
in English. The full search strategy is provided in the Supplementary material online, Appendix.
Two independent investigators performed the eligibility assessment
(A.D.F. and M.G.); disagreements were discussed and resolved by consensus. The reference lists of the selected articles were also searched for
relevant publications. For overlapping studies, the largest series or the
series with the longest follow-up were considered.

Sex-related differences after CABG

Supplementary analysis with focus on preoperative left
ventricular ejection fraction

Supplementary analysis based on the Open Heart
Surgery Registry
To evaluate potential differences in sex effect in a real-world population,
we accessed the Open Heart Surgery Registry, the mandatory database
of the state of New Jersey, to identify patients who underwent CABG in
years 2000-2017. This database is maintained by the New Jersey
Department of Health; data are collected by clinical staff at all hospitals
performing cardiac surgery in the State. External medical audits verify
data quality annually. Long-term clinical outcomes were obtained for individual patients by linking this Open Heart Surgery Registry with the New
Jersey Cardiac Catheterization Registry, the New Jersey Discharge Data
Collection System, and the New Jersey Vital Statistics death registry, as
previously described.13,14 Patients were followed up until 31 December

Table 1

2019. The statistical methods used for this supplementary analysis were
the same used in the primary analysis.

Supplementary analysis including trial-level data of percutaneous intervention vs. coronary artery bypass
grafting
A trial-level meta-analysis was performed pooling aggregate data from
the primary analysis and from the CABG arm of the largest trials comparing percutaneous interventions (PCI) and CABG. Details for this analysis
are provided in the Supplementary material online, Appendix.
A fixed-order sequential testing method using an alpha level of 0.05
was used to adjust for multiple comparisons in the primary analysis.
Significance testing was not performed for the secondary analysis nor for
the non-fatal components of the primary composite outcome. For these
analyses, only estimates of the association between treatment and outcomes and corresponding 95% CIs were provided, and the results were
interpreted as exploratory. All P-values were two-sided. In all the analyses, the male group was used as the reference.
Statistical analyses were performed with R version 3.6.1. and the following packages: coxme, meta, prodlim, twang, Publish.

Results
A total of 1828 studies were identified from the literature search, of
which 1225 were screened for eligibility. Four trials met the inclusion
criteria [the Arterial Revascularization Trial (ART) the CABG Off or

To better evaluate the effect of preoperative LVEF on the outcomes by
sex, individual patient data from the STICHES (Surgical Treatment of
Ischaemic Heart Failure Extension Study) trial12 (comparing CABG with
medical therapy in patients with LVEF <_35% at 10-year follow-up-see
Supplementary material online, Appendix for details of the trial) were
obtained through the Biologic Specimen and Data Repository
Information Coordinating Center of the National Heart, Lung and Blood
Institute and added to the database used for the primary analysis. The
statistical methods used for this supplementary analysis were the same
used in the primary analysis; the only difference was the categorization of
preoperative LVEF that in this analysis was performed using a three-, rather than two-, level classification (>50%, 30-50%, and <30%).

Trials description
In the ART trial,15 3102 CABG patients were randomly assigned to bilateral or single internal thoracic artery grafting (1548 vs. 1554 patients,
respectively). Patients were enrolled from 2004 to 2007 at 28 hospitals
from 4 continents and a total of 7 countries. At 10-year follow-up, the

authors found no significant between-group difference in the rate of
death from any cause (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.82-1.12) and in the composite outcome of death, MI, or stroke (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.79-1.03).
In the CORONARY trial,16 4752 patients were randomly assigned to
undergo off-pump or on-pump CABG (2375 vs. 2377 patients, respectively). Patients were enrolled from 2006 to 2011 at 79 centres from 4
continents and 19 countries. At 4.8-year follow-up, the rate of the composite outcome of death, stroke, MI, renal failure, or repeat revascularization was similar between groups (HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.87-1.10).
In the GOPCABE trial,17 2539 patients aged >_75 years were randomly assigned to undergo off-pump or on-pump CABG (1271 vs.
1268 patients, respectively). Patients were enrolled from 2008 to

2011 at 12 centres in Germany. At 5-year follow-up, survival rates
(HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.89-1.19) and the combined outcome of death,
MI, and repeat revascularization (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.89-1.18) were
similar in the two groups.
In the PREVENT IV trial,18 3014 patients undergoing primary
CABG surgery with at least two planned saphenous vein grafts were
randomly assigned to undergo ex vivo vein graft treatment with either
edifoligide or placebo (1508 vs. 1506 patients, respectively). Patients
were enrolled from 2002 to 2003 at 107 sites in the USA. At 5-year
follow-up, the rates of the adjusted composite outcome of death, MI,
or revascularization (HR 1.15, 95% CI 1.00-1.31) and of death or MI
(HR 1.21, 95% CI 1.03-1.43) were significantly higher in patients
receiving saphenous vein grafts with multiple vs. single distal targets.
Baseline patients' characteristics and operative outcomes in the individual trials are provided in Supplementary material online, Tables
S3 and S4, respectively.
Overall, 13 193 patients (10 479 men and 2714 women) were
included. Baseline and operative characteristics from the pooled sample are summarized in Table 1. The female cohort was older and
more symptomatic and had higher prevalence of comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension, PVD, previous stroke) compared to the male
cohort. Intraoperatively, the rate of off-pump procedures was similar
between women and men; women received a significantly lower
number of grafts and arterial grafts.
The mean follow-up time was 5.3 +/- 2.4 and 5.8 +/- 2.5 years in the
female and male cohorts, respectively.

use of MAG vs. SAG (interaction P = 0.39), diabetes (interaction
P = 0.09), prior MI (interaction P = 0.26), and LVEF <50% (interaction
P = 0.07) did not modify the effect of sex on MACCE.
Age had a similar modifier effect on all-cause mortality with the
same 75 years cut-off (adjusted HR 1.18, 95% CI 1.02-1.36 for age
<75; adjusted HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.79-1.03 for age >_75; interaction
P < 0.001) (Supplementary material online, Figure S3).
In the landmark analysis starting at 30 days from randomization, female sex was not associated with an increased risk of MACCE
(adjusted HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.97-1.16) (Figure 5).
The pooled estimate for the primary endpoint from the two-stage
analysis was consistent with the main analysis (Supplementary material online, Figures S4 and S5).

Secondary analysis
Propensity scores-weighting achieved good balance between off- vs.
on-pump and MAG vs. SAG groups for both sexes (Supplementary
material online, Tables S5-S8). The risk of MACCE was similar after
off- vs. on-pump surgery for women (adjusted HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.81-
1.08) and men (adjusted HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.94-1.10) (Supplementary
material online, Figure S6A and B). When compared to SAG, MAG was
associated with a reduction in the risk of MACCE in men (adjusted HR
0.86, 95% CI 0.78-0.95) but not in women (adjusted HR 0.97, 95% CI
0.80-1.17) (Supplementary material online, Figure S6C and D).

Supplementary analyses
The results of the analysis including the STICHES trial were consistent with the primary analysis (adjusted HR for MACCE 1.12, 95% CI
1.04-1.21; adjusted HR for mortality 1.03, 95% CI 0.94-1.14)

(Supplementary material online, Table S9 and Figure S7). Preoperative
LVEF was a significant sex effect modifier; women with preoperative
LVEF <30% had lower risk of MACCE compared to men, while the
opposite was seen among patients with LVEF >30% (Supplementary
material online, Figure S8).
The results of the analysis of the Open Heart Surgery Registry
were consistent with the primary analysis (HR for MACCE 1.15, 95%
CI 1.13-1.15, HR for mortality 1.04, 95% CI 1.004-1.07)
(Supplementary material online, Table S10 and Figure S9).
In the trial-level meta-analysis including the PCI vs. CABG trials,
women had higher risk of MACCE and mortality than men (HR 1.09,
95% CI 0.85-1.39 and HR 1.41, 95% CI 1.04-1.92, respectively)
(Supplementary material online, Figure S10).

Discussion
In this analysis of 13 193 patients (2714 women) followed for a mean
of 5 years, we found that, after CABG, women have higher adjusted
incidence of adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events, but similar
mortality compared to men. The higher incidence of MACCE is
mostly driven by a higher rate of MI and repeat revascularization.
A new and important finding is that the difference between sexes
is inversely associated with age and disappears at 75 years. Coronary
artery disease in young women has distinct pathophysiological features and outcomes; e.g. women more often have coronary dissection, microvascular dysfunction, spasm, or myocardial bridges than
men and have higher mortality after acute coronary events.7,19,20 In a
large registry study including 51 187 patients (15 178 women),21

Sex-related differences after CABG

Vaccarino et al. found that women younger than 50 years had two
times higher adjusted operative mortality after CABG compared to
men of the same age range and that the difference in operative outcomes between sexes decreased with increasing age. It is possible
that CABG is less effective in a younger female population, but this
has not been investigated in details.
Another important finding is that preoperative LVEF was a significant sex effect modifier; while women with preoperative LVEF >30%
had increased risk of MACCE compared to men, the opposite was
true among patients with LVEF <30%.
We have also found that women have a higher risk of perioperative
MI after CABG and in the landmark analysis excluding the early postoperative period, the difference in outcome between groups was
clearly attenuated. Native coronary arteries and bypass conduits in
women are generally smaller,22,23 and there is in vitro evidence that
they may have a higher tendency to spasm compared to men.24,25 It is
possible that the CABG procedure is technically more complex in
women and that graft failure due to technical reasons may have played
a role in the observed differences. The higher rate of perioperative MI
may have also affected the mid-term outcomes.26 The tendency to
spasm7,19 and the technical complexity are likely increased in younger
women and this may explain the reported association of age with the

difference in outcomes between sexes. These findings are hypothesis
generating and require further investigation.
In the only published study-level meta-analysis investigating the impact of sex on outcomes following CABG, Alam et al.27 pooled data
from 20 studies and 966 492 patients (277 783 women) and found
that female sex was associated with higher adjusted risk of operative
mortality and that the mortality differences between sexes persisted
at 5-year follow-up (OR 1.77, 95% CI 1.67-1.88 and OR 1.14, 95% CI
1.08-1.20, respectively).
Our analysis also suggests that variations in CABG surgical technique (off- vs. on-pump surgery and use of MAG vs. SAG) do not improve the outcomes of women and do not reduce the difference
between sexes. This finding highlights the need to explore new modifications of the surgical technique or of postoperative protocols to
improve CABG outcomes in women.
The secondary analyses comparing the effect of different surgical
techniques in the two sexes suffer from inevitable treatment allocation and expertise biases28 and were designed to provide exploratory
data on the relative difference in treatment effect by sex, not on the
absolute efficacy of the four techniques analysed.
Off-pump CABG was not associated with significant changes in
outcomes both in men and women. This is concordant with the

results of RCTs and observational studies limited to surgeons with
experience in the off-pump technique.16,29 In contrast, MAG was
associated with better outcomes in men, but not in women. The
available observational evidence on the use of MAG in women is conflicting, with some studies suggesting and others refuting a clinical
benefit for women who receive more than one arterial graft for
CABG.30-34 Data suggest that the potential benefit of MAG may be
lost in higher risk patients,13,35 and this may explain why women, who
have worse baseline risk profile, may not benefit as much as men
from MAG. Overall, our analysis suggests that a sex-related difference in the effect of MAG may exist and underlines the need for new
and better evidence on this topic.
Several limitations of this study must be acknowledged. Outcome
definitions and event adjudication were not standardized in the

included trials, although all used an independent adjudication committee. It is likely that there was substantial heterogeneity in surgical
techniques and postoperative protocols between the included trials
and the individual participating sites. Finally, the cardiovascular event
rate in CABG patients increases substantially after the fifth postoperative year and longer-term data are needed to confirm the present
results (e.g. the benefit of MAG may become apparent in women
with longer follow-up). On the other hand, results were solid in multiple sensitivity and supplementary analyses, even when including aggregate data from other trials and when repeating the analysis in a
large real-world registry.
In conclusion, in a pooled analysis of four large CABG trials, we
have found that, in the first 5 years after surgery, women have worse
cardiac and cerebrovascular outcomes than men. The difference in

outcomes between the sexes is not evident after 75 years of age and
is significantly affected by preoperative LVEF, but not by variations in
the surgical technique used. Women have a higher risk of perioperative MI that may be due to technical factors and may be one of the
reasons for the difference in mid-term outcomes.
Further effort in understanding and improving the outcome of
women (and particularly younger women) undergoing CABG are
needed.
