Aims

The aim of this study was to investigate the association between within-individual changes in physical activity and
onset of atrial fibrillation (AF).

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
A total of 1410 participants from the general population (46.2% women, mean age 74.7 +/- 4.1 years) with risk facand results
tors but with no prior AF diagnosis underwent continuous monitoring for AF episodes along with daily accelero-

metric assessment of physical activity using an implantable loop recorder during 3.5 years. The combined duration
of monitoring was 1.6 million days, where 10 851 AF episodes lasting >_60 min were detected in 361 participants
(25.6%) with a median of 5 episodes (2, 25) each. The median daily physical activity was 112 (66, 168) min/day. A
dynamic parameter describing within-individual changes in daily physical activity, i.e. average daily activity in the last
week compared to the previous 100 days, was computed and used to model the onset of AF. A 1-h decrease in
average daily physical activity was associated with AF onset the next day [odds ratio 1.24 (1.18-1.31)]. This effect
was modified by overall level of activity (P < 0.001 for interaction), and the signal was strongest in the tertile of participants with lowest activity overall [low: 1.62 (1.41-1.86), mid: 1.27 (1.16-1.39), and high: 1.10 (1.01-1.19)].

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusions
Within-individual changes in physical activity are associated with the onset of AF episodes as detected by continu-

ous monitoring in a high-risk population. For each person, a 1-h decrease in daily physical activity during the last
week increased the odds of AF onset the next day by 25%, while the strongest association was seen in the group
with the lowest activity overall.

Graphical Abstract

Introduction
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, and
the incidence of AF is associated with cardiovascular risk factors such
as hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolaemia.1,2 While physical activity is known to be protective against these risk factors, multiple investigations have focused on physical activity as an either
harmful or protective element in AF pathophysiology.3,4
So far, the association has proven complex since some studies
have linked rigorous physical exercise to AF risk,5-8 while others
found sedentary lifestyle to be an important risk factor for development of AF, and even others have found the association direction to
be dependent on age.9-13 Indeed, exercise-induced and sedentaryinduced AF might represent two different entities. In general, the protective impact of moderate physical activity might outweigh the negative impact,3,14 especially in older individuals.12 Finally, decreased
physical activity could be a marker of conditions leading to AF rather
than a causal factor. With the advent of increasingly accessible wearable technology, interest is growing in the potential to measure physical activity and AF on a day-to-day basis.15-18 Implantable loop

.. recorder (ILR) monitoring provides a unique opportunity to study
..
.. the association between the two by means of daily objective meas..
.. urements of movement along with high accuracy for AF detection.
..
The current study aims to gain insight into the association between
..
.. objectively measured physical activity and incident AF in patients with
.. risk factors, and to describe whether day-to-day patterns in physical
..
.. activity (i.e. within-individual changes in physical activity) can be
.. related to AF onset.

Data handling and statistical analysis
All information was registered in and acquired from an online database
specific to the LOOP study. All AF episodes occurring before the first
adjudicated episode were discarded. Characteristics such as age, sex,
medication, and disease history were obtained at the baseline visit.
For summary statistics, continuous variables were presented as mean
+/- standard deviation for normally distributed variables compared by ttests, and median (interquartile range) for non-normally distributed variables compared by Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, while categorical variables
were presented as frequency and percentage compared by chi-squared
tests. For the analysis of data with more than two groups, the Kruskal-
Wallis method was used and in case of significance, the inter-group significance was assessed using Tukey and Kramer method.
AF episodes lasting at least 1 h were used as the outcome in the main
analyses. Association between physical activity and AF was analysed first
using time-to-event and second using within-individual changes.
For the time-to-event analysis, the average daily physical activity in the
first 100 days of monitoring was calculated, which was then used as the independent variable with new-onset AF after 100 days as the dependent
variable. Cumulative incidences were calculated, and a Cox proportionalhazards model was tested. The proportional-hazards assumption was
assessed with Schoenfeld residuals and any violations were reported.
Multivariate models were tested including age, sex, hypertension, diabetes, heart failure, previous stroke, systemic arterial embolism or transient ischaemic attack, and previous myocardial infarction, percutaneous
coronary intervention, or coronary artery bypass graft. The final model
included all of these variables.
For the within-individual analysis, changes in daily physical activity
(DPA) were computed by comparing 'recent' daily physical activity with

.. the preceding 'usual' daily physical activity. Here, recent daily physical ac..
.. tivity was defined as the average physical activity during the previous
.. week up (PAmean7d) until but not including the day used to determine the
.. outcome (AF onset or not), and usual physical activity was defined as the
..
.. average physical activity during the prior 100 days (PAmean100d). To avoid
.. overlap, PAmean100d had a lag of 7 days. DPA was then defined by
..
.. PAmean100d-PAmean7d and was calculated for each day for each partici.. pant moving one day at a time. In this way, several time epochs were
..
.. defined, and the data were extended to include one data point per moni.. toring day per participant, except for the first 100 days per participant. A
.. graphical example of how DPA was computed can be seen in Figure 1.
..
..
Logistic regression was then used to estimate the association between
.. AF episode onset and within-individual changes in physical activity for all
..
.. days in the data set. Three models were tested: M1, M2, and M3. M1 was
.. adjusted for the total number of prior AF episodes. M2 was further
..
.. adjusted for age, sex and annual season; spring, summer, fall, winter
.. (defined by date cut-offs; 1 June, 1 September, 1 December, and 1
.. March). M3 was further adjusted for baseline risk factors: hypertension,
..
.. diabetes, heart failure, previous stroke, systemic arterial embolism or
.. transient ischaemic attack, and previous myocardial infarction, percutan..
.. eous coronary intervention, or coronary artery bypass graft.
..
A supplementary analysis was conducted using the relative change in
..
.. physical activity (PAmean100d/PAmean7d) instead of absolute change. In
.. this analysis, a maximum value of 100 (i.e. factor 100 increase) was
.. defined, as it tended to rapidly increase towards infinity on days with low
..
.. PAmean100d.
..
Sub-analyses were performed after stratifying by overall level of phys..
.. ical activity; PAlow, PAmid, and PAhigh based on tertiles of average daily
.. physical activity during the first 100 days for the time-to-event analysis,
..
.. and over the entire study period for the within-individual analysis. The
.. within-individual analysis included test for interaction between overall
.. level of physical activity and DPA.
..
..
Two sets of sensitivity analyses were applied. The first set investigated
.. AF episodes lasting at least 6 min, 5.5 h, or 24 h instead of 1 h and was
..
.. applied for both the time-to-event analysis and the within-individual ana.. lysis. The second set was applied only for the within-individual analysis as
.. it defined DPA by different time windows than PAmean100d-
..
.. PAmean7d, i.e. PAmean100d-PAmean2d, PAmean30d-PAmean7d, and
.. PA
mean30d-PAmean2d . A P-value <0.05 was considered statistically signifi..
.. cant. Data handling and analysis were performed using R version 4.0.1

In short, individuals from the general population were identified by administrative registries and invited by letter to participate. Eligible individuals had to be >_70 years old and diagnosed with >_1 of the following stroke
risk factors: hypertension, diabetes, heart failure, or previous stroke,
while those with any history of AF or cardiac implantable electronic device were excluded. At a baseline visit, a standard ECG was obtained to
rule out prevalent AF and confirm study eligibility. Included participants
were randomized in a 1:3 ratio to receive an ILR with continuous heart
rhythm monitoring (Reveal LINQV, Medtronic) vs. standard care.
For participants in the ILR group, new AF alerts were reviewed daily
by an experienced physician. Any new-onset episode suspicious of AF
lasting >_6 min was independently adjudicated by two senior cardiologists.
Any dispute was resolved by majority vote after involving a third senior
cardiologist blinded to the previous evaluations. In patients with adjudicated AF, an experienced physician furthermore adjudicated the first episode lasting at least 1, 5.5, and 24 h. The ILR was also used to measure
physical activity. The device uses a single axis from an embedded accelerometer to capture movement as an electric signal, by which the number
of minutes the person is active is counted, where a minute is considered
active if a threshold is reached incorporating both the number and magnitude of deflections. This method has proven responsive in capturing activities of daily living, and these measurements of physical activity have been
found to correlate with clinical events.20-23 Transmission of data from
the ILR continued until the end of device battery-life (minimum 3 years),
device explantation, or death. All AF episodes and daily physical activity
totals in minutes were retrieved for each day for each participant during
the study.
The current study comprised all participants in the LOOP study
receiving ILR and for whom ILR assessments of AF and physical activity
could be retrieved.

found across 361 participants (25.6%) having a median number of 5
(2, 25), mean 30 +/- 67, episodes per person.
Of the 429 patients with AF episodes lasting at least 6 min, 50
(11.7%) were symptomatic at debut of AF, 19 (4.4%) received any
antiarrhythmic therapy (class Ic or III drugs, or ablation, or cardioversion) during monitoring, 4 (0.9%) underwent ablation and 14 (3.3%)
cardioversion. Of the 361 patients with AF episodes lasting at least
1 h, 46 (12.7%) were symptomatic at debut, 17 (4.7%) received any
antiarrhythmic therapy during monitoring, 4 (1.1%) underwent ablation, and 12 (3.3%) cardioversion. In general, patients with AF were
older, more frequently male, and had slower sinus heart rate at baseline (Supplementary material online, Table S1).

Physical activity
The median daily physical activity for the participants was 112 (66,
168) min/day during all of monitoring, with tertiles 80 min/day and
141 min/day, used to define physical activity groups: PAlow, PAmedium,
and PAhigh. Male sex, age >_75 years, previous transient ischaemic attack or stroke, diabetes, and heart failure were all associated with
lower physical activity (Tables 2 and 3). The distribution of physical
activity for all days in the data set is shown in Figure 2A and the distribution of 'recent' compared to 'usual' physical activity (DPA) are
shown in Figure 2B. The 95th and 99th percentiles for DPA were at
-45 and -76 min. A total of 33 108 days (2.2%) had a DPA of -1 h or
more, with a median of 25 (9.52) days per person.

Figure 1 Graphical example of changes in recent compared to usual physical activity (DPA) and a pattern of DPA leading up to an AF episode. (A)
Daily physical activity used to calculate DPA leading up to the day of AF onset (blue triangle): recent physical activity (during the most recent week,
with a horizontal line illustrating the mean, PAmean7d, green), and usual physical activity (during the prior 100 days, with a horizontal line illustrating
the mean, PAmean100d, red). (B) The pattern of DPA values leading up to an AF episode. Each day, DPA is calculated by subtracting PAmean7d from
PAmean100d, where PAmean7d is defined as the average daily physical activity in the week leading up to but not including that particular day, and
PAmean100d is defined as the average daily physical activity in the 100 days prior to that week. AF, atrial fibrillation.

Atrial fibrillation and changes in physical activity

Discussion
We used long-term monitoring of physical activity and AF in 1410
individuals without known AF but with risk factors to associate physical activity and day-to-day changes in physical activity with AF episodes. The key findings were (i) a low level of physical activity overall
was associated with development of AF, but this was confounded by
age; (ii) low physical activity on any given day was slightly associated
with AF onset on that day; (iii) within-individual changes in physical
activity was strongly associated with AF onset; and (iv) the magnitude
of the association between within-individual changes in physical activity and AF onset was dependent on the general level of physical activity (Graphical abstract).

Physical activity and AF
The association between physical activity and AF has been found to
follow different shapes such as linear, J-shaped, or U-shaped, dependently on the age and characteristics of the study population.9,12 This
has created the hypothesis that underlying mechanisms responsible
for an increased risk of AF are different from those responsible for a
reduced risk of AF. Factors protecting against AF could be linked to
the positive effects of physical activity on well-known epidemiological
cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolaemia, and obesity, while more specific effects could include
reduced epicardial fat, lower burden of sleep apnoea, and lower agerelated decline in arterial elasticity.25-27 Factors predisposing to AF
could be linked to left atrial dilatation, left ventricular hypertrophy,
and increased parasympathetic tone, although mainly investigated in
athletes.28
Numerous studies have investigated the association between
physical activity and AF, but the focus has mainly been on young to
middle-aged adults and rigorous exercise opposed to activities of
daily living.7,11,29 Albeit studies such as the Cardiovascular Health
Study and the Rotterdam Study looked at leisure-time activity and
development of AF in populations aged >_65 and >_55 years, physical activity was, however, based on subjective values estimated
through questionnaires, and AF detection on occasional ECG
measurements.4,9 While one study found an association between
low baseline physical activity and risk of AF,9 the other did not.4

and PAhigh odds ratio 1.10 (1.01, 1.19) (Figure 4). The supplementary
analysis using relative change in physical activity (PAmean100day/
PAmean7day), instead of absolute change, showed that a reduction of
10% increased the odds of AF event onset by factor 1.09 (1.07, 1.10).
When grouped by overall activity this was only statistically significant
for participants in the low (PAlow) and medium (PAmid) activity group
in which a reduction of 10% increased the odds of AF onset by factor
1.11 (1.09, 1.12) and 1.06 (1.02, 1.09), respectively. The sensitivity
analyses defining AF by a cut-off of 6 min, 5.5 h, or 24 h showed similar findings, albeit the effect size of decreased physical activity was
larger with regard to the longer AF episodes (Supplementary material
online, Table S3). The sensitivity analyses defining DPA by different
time windows showed similar findings, albeit the signal was weaker
when looking at short-term changes in PA (Supplementary material
online, Table S4).

decline in physical activity and onset of AF could to some extent be
due to lack of exercise leading to AF in itself, while another possible
explanation could be the presence of unknown, subclinical conditions
leading to both decreased physical activity and then to AF. The interaction analysis illustrated that the dynamic relationship between

reported that nights with more sleep-disordered breathing conferred
a higher risk of AF.

Future perspectives
One of the traits of the digital age is the promise of individual risk estimation on a day-to-day basis. Our findings illustrate the potential utility of day-to-day monitoring of physical activity as a biomarker for
forthcoming AF. The recent years have seen an explosion in so-called
'wearables', both developed for clinical use and for the consumer
market. The technology is continuously improving with regards to
monitoring activities of daily life and exploring risk factors or even
detecting clinical disease. Many such devices are capable of accelerometry and are thus able to measure physical activity, making this a
topic of interest.15-18 The clinical utility and possible health benefits

.. for patients are far from fully understood. Patient-initiated health
..
.. monitoring with digitally delivered feedback imposes new challenges
..
.. to health care systems as concerns remain when it comes to validity
.. and reliability of the data. Potential benefits from the utilization of pa..

Conclusion
Using data from long-term, continuous heart rhythm monitoring and
accelerometry in 1410 individuals with stroke risk factors we demonstrated an association between physical activity and AF onset on a
day-to-day basis. Specifically, a 1-h reduction in recent compared to
usual daily activity accounted for a 25% increase in the odds of AF the
next day. These findings illustrate the potential of day-to-day monitoring of physical activity as a biomarker for the risk of AF.

one comorbidity which impeded the ability to investigate the impact
of individual comorbidities.
Also, the multivariate model included comorbidities at baseline,
not interim conditions occurring during the approximately 3 years of
monitoring. We did not have data on sleep apnoea. The absolute risk
of AF onset on any given day was limited.
As the ILR used a single axis accelerometer, it was only capable of
detecting movement in a binary way (active or inactive) and it was
not possible to categorize physical activity by type (walking, running,
biking, etc.) or intensity levels (leisure, moderate, vigorous exercise,
etc.), which is arguably inferior to more advanced tri-axial accelerometry.14 Furthermore, the ILR algorithm used for AF detection in the
current study has significant false-positive rates. Mittal et al. reported
that in patients with stroke risk factors but without known AF only
39% of AF alerts lasting >_6 min would be deemed true AF, while for
alerts lasting >_1 h, the proportions were 91-97%.30 For this reason,
we applied a rigorous adjudication regimen for new-onset AF and
then focused our analysis on the longer episodes.
