Aims

In recent years, microcalcifications identified in routine mammograms were found to be associated with cardiometabolic disease in women. Here, we aimed to systematically evaluate the association of microcalcifications and
other mammographic features with cardiometabolic disease risk and mortality in a large screening cohort and to
understand a potential genetic contribution.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
This study included 57 867 women from a prospective mammographic screening cohort in Sweden (KARMA) and
49 583 sisters. Cardiometabolic disease diagnoses and mortality and medication were extracted by linkage to
and results

Swedish population registries with virtually no missing data. In the cardiometabolic phenome-wide association
study, we found that a higher number of microcalcifications were associated with increased risk for multiple cardiometabolic diseases, particularly in women with pre-existing cardiometabolic diseases. In contrast, dense breasts
were associated with a lower incidence of cardiometabolic diseases. Importantly, we observed similar associations
in sisters of KARMA women, indicating a potential genetic overlap between mammographic features and cardiometabolic traits. Finally, we observed that the presence of microcalcifications was associated with increased cardiometabolic mortality in women with pre-existing cardiometabolic diseases (hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval:
1.79 [1.24-2.58], P = 0.002) while we did not find such effects in women without cardiometabolic diseases.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusions
We found that mammographic features are associated with cardiometabolic risk and mortality. Our results

strengthen the notion that a combination of mammographic features and other breast cancer risk factors could be
a novel and affordable tool to assess cardiometabolic health in women attending mammographic screening.

Introduction
Cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, and
other related conditions are considered cardiometabolic diseases,
which are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in women.1
Despite the huge individual and societal burden of cardiometabolic
diseases, there are currently no effective, affordable, and comprehensive screening methods available to detect women with prevalent
cardiometabolic diseases.2-4 Among the current efforts to reduce
the mortality from cardiometabolic diseases is the identification and
preventive treatment of high-risk individuals.5,6 However, identification of individuals with a high risk for cardiometabolic disease is

challenging,7 even when accounting for multiple risk factors such as
obesity, hypertension, diet, smoking, air pollution and lack of physical
activity.8-10 In addition, the established risk prediction algorithms usually specific for certain age, sex, and ethnic groups and may over- or
underestimate the risk in other groups.11,12
Similar to cardiometabolic diseases, identification of women at
high risk for breast cancer (BC) is important to reduce overall mortality. Multiple risk prediction tools based on reproductive history,
hormonal and life-style factors as well as genetic predisposition are
available, although they perform even worse compared to established cardiometabolic risk prediction tools.13 Therefore, mammographic screening programmes were established and have proven

Mammographic features

Methods
Study population
The Karolinska Mammography Project for Risk Prediction of Breast
Cancer (KARMA) is a population-based prospective screening cohort of
70 872 women attending the mammography screening programme in
Sweden from January 2011 to March 2013.25 Reasons for exclusion are
given in Supplementary material online, Figure S1. Briefly, women without
mammographic measurements (either microcalcifications or percent
mammographic density), women with prevalent BC (i.e. BC diagnosed
before recruitment) as well as women with missing BMI information
were excluded. Furthermore, all women who underwent breast reduction or enhancement or other breast surgeries were excluded, resulting
in an analytical dataset of 57 867 women. All participants signed an

.. informed consent form and Stockholm ethical review board approved
..
.. the study (2010/958-31/1).
..
..
.. Measurement of mammographic features
..
.. Raw mammograms from mediolateral oblique and cranio-caudal views of
.. left and right breasts were collected. We used a computer aided detec.. tion system (M-Vu CADV; iCAD, Nashua, NH, USA) an FDA-approved
..
.. software, class 3 device (PMA number P010038) to identify suspicious
.. microcalcification clusters as described previously.26 In this study, we cal..
for each
.. culated the total number of such clusters in both the breasts
.. woman and considered this the main outcome/exposure.27,28 Hereafter,
.. we refer to those clusters as MC throughout the manuscript.
..
..
Percent mammographic density was computed from the dense area
.. (cm2) divided by the total area (cm2) of the left and right breast, respect..
.. ively using the STRATUS method.29 The total percent mammographic
.. density of a women was computed from the average percent mammo.. graphic density of both breasts. We considered women with an average
..
.. breast density above the mean percent density in the study population
.. (22.46%, standard deviation 19.56) to have dense breast tissue and used
..
.. this variable as the outcome/exposure in this study.
..
..
.. Breast cancer genetic risk predictors
.. Family history of BC was ascertained using the linkage to Swedish Multi..
.. generational Register and Swedish Cancer Registry.26,30 We considered
.. women to have a positive family history of BC in case any first degree
.. relative (parents, siblings or children) were diagnosed with BC up until 31
..
.. December 2018.
..
The GRS for BC was computed as the effect size (log odds ratio)
..
.. weighted sum of 313 BC risk increasing alleles, previously identified by
.. the BC association consortium.31 Briefly, we computed two scores, one
..
.. indicative of increased risk for oestrogen receptor (ER) positive BC and
.. one predisposing for ER negative BC. Thus, each of the 313 variants was
.. multiplied (weighted) by the log odds ratio of the association of the vari..
.. ant with either ER positive or negative BC, respectively, as reported in.31
.. Then, we computed mean of the (ER positive or ER negative) weighted
.. allele count of all 313 variants for each individual and scaled the scores to
..
.. each have a standard deviation of 1 and a mean of 0. The scores were
.. shown to be well calibrated and predictive of high BC risk in the tails of
..
.. the distribution, even in non-European populations,32 with area under
.. the curve (AUC) values ranging from 0.60 to 0.64. Women in KARMA
.. were genotyped through the Breast Cancer Association Consortium
..
.. (BCAC) on a custom Ilumina iSelect genotyping array as part of the
.. Collaborative Oncological Gene-environment Study or on the
..
.. OncoArray.33-35 Quality control and imputation of missing and un.. genotyped variants was performed by the BCAC. Briefly, missing geno.. types were imputed to the 1000 Genomes Phase 3 reference haplotypes
..
.. using ShapeIt36 and IMPUTE37 and variants with an imputation quality
.. (R2) greater 0.3 and a minor allele frequency >0.01 were retained.
..
..
.. Covariates
..
.. Participants of the KARMA cohort completed a detailed web-based ques.. tionnaire. Established risk factors were categorized as: smoking status
..
.. (never, former, current, missing), age at first birth (no birth, <20, 20-25,
.. 25-30, 30-35, and >35 years, missing), oral contraceptive use (no, yes,
..
.. missing), hormone therapy use (never, former, current, missing), and edu.. cation attainment (less than nine years, high school degree, university de.. gree). The total daily physical activity (in MET-hour/day) represents the
..
.. amount of physical activity that a participant carries out per day and is
.. computed from the sum of physical activity related to sleeping, work,
.. transportation, leisure time, and sports. We categorized physical activity

effective at reducing BC mortality world-wide.14 In addition to
detecting early stages of malignant tissue, the mammographic images
collected in the screening programme reveal additional features,
some of which are considered to be important risk factors for
BC.15,16
One such feature is microcalcifications (MC) that appear as small
bright dots on mammograms and are calcium deposits of <1 mm in
diameter. They are likely a consequence of epithelial-mesenchymal
transition of epithelial cells, resulting in the formation of stiff extracellular matrix.17 Depending on the morphology, MC are considered either benign or a sign of malignant BC.18,19 In a previous study,
increased age, family history of BC and a high genetic risk score
(GRS) for BC were associated with more MC. In contrast, higher
body mass index (BMI), current smoking behaviour as well as moderate to high alcohol consumption resulted in fewer MC.20 Importantly,
multiple reports indicated that mammographic MC are associated
with increased prevalence and incidence of cardiovascular and coronary artery disease (summarized in21). Similarly, a higher number of
MC are frequently observed in women with chronic renal failure,22,23
thus strongly implicating MC to be involved in multiple cardiometabolic diseases.
Compared to MC, the connection between mammographic density and cardiometabolic diseases is less evident. Milk glands, milk
ducts, and supportive tissue are dense tissue24 and appear white on
mammograms. Importantly, the amount of dense tissue is considered
a risk factor for BC and can also obscure the detection of early BC
stages. The dense area is correlated to most established risk factors
for BC, particularly those related to increased oestrogen exposure
due to the individual's hormonal and reproductive history. In contrast, the dark (non-dense) areas are indeed fatty tissue, which increase with advanced age, higher BMI, and smoking. Notably, those
predictors are also major risk factors for cardiometabolic diseases as
well as related conditions and, accordingly, breast density could be a
useful indicator for cardiometabolic health.
Hence, in this study, we aimed to further dissect the relationship
between mammographic features and cardiometabolic diseases in a
large prospective mammographic screening cohort. In addition, we
wanted to investigate the occurrence of cardiometabolic diseases in
sisters of KARMA women and explore the effect of BC genetics on
cardiometabolic diseases to improve our understanding on the
shared risk between both conditions.

Cardiometabolic disease ascertainment
We extracted the ICD10 codes of disease diagnoses for all women in
KARMA from the In- and Outpatient Registry as well as the Cancer
Registry up until 31 December 2018. Since the outpatient registry data
(as well as consistent ICD10 coding) was available starting 2001, we
restricted the analyses to diagnoses between 01 January 2001 and 31
December 2018 or date of a BC diagnosis, if applicable. Sisters of
KARMA participants were identified using the Swedish Multi-generational
Register (MGR). Briefly, by linkage to the MGR were able to identify
91.9% of the mothers of KARMA women, which then allowed us to identify a total of 49 583 sisters of KARMA women. Cardiometabolic disease
diagnoses for sisters between 01 January 2001 and 31 December 2018
were then retrieved from the same registries as above. The Swedish
registries provides almost complete coverage of diseases occurring in
both KARMA women and their sisters and the follow-up period is consistent for all women (median: 6.70 years, inter-quartile boundaries: 6.20-
7.19 years) due to linkage to the registries occurring for all Karma women
and their sisters at the same time.
The extracted ICD10 codes were mapped to phecodes with the phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) package41 as implemented in R.42
This approach combines and maps different ICD codes from electronic
health records to clinically relevant outcomes, which were manually
defined by clinical experts. An interactive view of the relevant mapping
can be queried at https://phewascatalog.org/phecodes_icd10. For instance, ischaemic heart disease status (phecode 411) is derived from ICD
codes I20-I25 (angina pectoris, acute and subsequent myocardial infarction, complications from myocardial infarction, other acute ischaemic
heart diseases, and chronic ischaemic heart disease), I34 (mitral valve prolapse), and I52.0 (cardiac septal defect). The hierarchical approach also
defines related diseases which are built-in exclusion criteria to prevent
contamination of control individuals with cases that have related diseases.43 In the case of ischaemic heart disease, individuals with myocardial
degeneration (I51.5), other ill-defined or unspecified heart diseases (I51.8
and I51.9) would not be used as controls in the analyses. We considered
all top level phecodes in our analyses relevant to cardiovascular diseases
(i.e. in the circulatory system group) and investigated the association of
mammographic features with all those phecodes. Furthermore, we

.. included phecodes related to diabetes (phecode 249 and 250) and renal
..
.. failure (585). Of note, the outcome hypertension (phecode 401) indicates
.. that hypertension was diagnosed in a clinic (inpatient) or outpatient prac..
.. tice, while the hypertension status used as a covariate in our analyses was
.. computed from the blood pressure measurements at baseline exam. We
.. also investigated as BC (phecode 174) to serve as a point of reference for
..
.. the observed effect sizes.
..
Since individuals with an existing cardiometabolic trait will also likely
..
.. be diagnosed again with the same condition after the mammogram, we
.. report the associations with incident cardiometabolic diseases separately
..
.. for individuals with any pre-existing cardiometabolic diseases as well as
.. individuals without the respective pre-existing condition.
..
Death from cardiometabolic diseases was ascertained from the
..
.. Swedish Cause of Death Registry44 for all KARMA women. Women
.. were followed for death from cardiometabolic disease (ICD codes I00-
..
.. I99 for cardiovascular diseases, N17-N19 for renal failure, and E10-E16
.. for diabetes) and censored in case they developed BC, died from other
.. causes or survived until 31 December 2018. Similarly, we also computed
..
.. cardiovascular mortality alone by restricting the ICD codes to those be.. tween I00 and I99.
..
..
.. Statistical analyses
..
.. Although the PheWAS could also be investigated by Cox regression,
.. which has slightly more power to detect associations,45,46 we chose to
..
.. use logistic regression. This approach does not make any assumptions
.. about whether to censor an individual at the first occurrence of a cardio.. metabolic diagnosis and thus also is agnostic to the trajectory of cardio..
.. metabolic diagnoses in the women over the study period. The results of
.. the PheWAS analyses were plotted with the phenotypePlot function
..
.. implemented in the PheWAS package. We controlled the false discovery
.. rate (FDR) to be <0.05 in the PheWAS and thus considered all associa.. tions with a Q-value of <0.05 to be statistically significant. Statistically sig..
.. nificant associations identified in the PheWAS (FDR <0.05) in at least one
.. analysis were further visualized with a correlation plot in for all investi..
.. gated BC risk factors using the corrplot function from the corrplot package,
.. implemented in R. In the correlation plot, we deemed associations of gen.. etic BC risk factors with cardiometabolic diseases with an uncorrected P..
.. value of <0.05 as statistically significant. Since those analyses are not used
.. to identify novel disease associations but rather to provide additional
..
.. insights into findings identified in the discovery, we do not adjust for mul.. tiple testing in these plots.
..

Alcohol consumption was ascertained from questionnaire and categorized into low or none (<100 g of alcohol per week), moderate (between
100 and 250 g) and high (>250 g).38 Hypertension was categorized into
five groups according to the 2017 American College of Cardiology/
American Heart Association Guideline for the Prevention, Detection,
Evaluation and Management of High Blood Pressure in Adults.39 Briefly,
systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was
measured at baseline and we categorized women as follows: both SBP/
DBP <120/<80 mmHg was considered normal, 120-129/<80 mmHg was
considered elevated, 130-139/80-89 mmHg was considered Stage I,
140-180/90-120 mmHg was considered Stage II, and SBP >180 or DBP
>120 mm Hg was coded as hypertensive crisis. We coded BMI and age at
mammogram as a continuous variable in our analyses. Women reporting
no natural menstruation over the past 12 months before study entry or
no menstruation due to oophorectomy were considered postmenopausal. Similarly, women with menses over the past year but no longer
menstruating during the 3 months prior to study entry were considered
peri-menopausal while women with menstruation in the prior 3 months
were considered pre-menopausal. Lipid lowering medication was
extracted by linkage to the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register, which contains all prescribed drugs dispensed at pharmacies40 since 2005. Within
this registry, we identified all women using lipid-lowering medications
(ATC code C10) between 2005 and study entry/qualifying mammogram.

Breast cancer genetics and cardiometabolic diseases

Sensitivity analyses
In a sensitivity analyses, we also present the fully adjusted association
results for cardiometabolic diseases, which were significantly associated
with mammographic features in the PheWAS (FDR <0.05). In those analyses, we adjusted for mammographic percent density, age at mammogram, BMI, smoking status, follow-up time, lipid-lowering medication,
hypertension, physical activity, alcohol consumption, education, age at
first birth, menopausal status, HRT use, and oral contraception use.
The iCAD system that was used for the automated assessment of MC
from mammograms in the breast captures both vascular health and
pathological changes due to breast hyperplasia; however, the method
used cannot distinguish between these. To address this issue, we have

We assessed the impact of family history of BC in close relatives on all
cardiometabolic diseases (i.e. any cardiometabolic disease occurring between 01 January 2001 and 31 December 2018) with logistic regression,
adjusted for age at baseline, number of sisters, number of daughters, BMI,
and smoking status.
Logistic regression analyses were used to investigate the association
between BC GRS and the risk of all cardiometabolic diseases (i.e. any cardiometabolic disease occurring between 01 January 2001 and 31
December 2018), adjusted for age at baseline, BMI, smoking status, and
genotyping platform. We also adjusted for the first two principal components computed from the genotypes to account for potential population
differences (i.e. population stratification47) as is standard practice in genetic association studies.

breast density were associated with increased risk for BC (P-value
<10-6, Figure 1 and Supplementary material online, Table S1).

and 51.81% for women with and without MC, respectively
(Supplementary material online, Table S1).
However, in women without prior cardiometabolic conditions, we
found that each additional MC detected in the screening was only
associated with the risk for hypertension and congestive heart failure
(FDR <0.05). In these women, the 5-year absolute risk to develop
any cardiometabolic disease was 21.38% for women with MC and
19.17% for women without MC present at screening.
We found that in women with a pre-existing cardiometabolic disease, breast density was not significantly associated with any incident
cardiometabolic diseases (FDR >0.05). In contrast, a higher breast
density at baseline in women without cardiometabolic diseases was

diagnoses such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chest pain and peripheral vascular disease, independently of the presence of MC (FDR
<0.05, Figures 1 and 2 and Supplementary material online, Table S1).

To dissect the relationship between mammographic features and cardiometabolic traits, we computed a cardiometabolic PheWAS with
the mammographic features as exposure, adjusted for the age at
mammogram, BMI, smoking and mammographic density or presence
of macrocalcifications.
Notably, in women with pre-existing cardiometabolic disease,
more MC were associated with increased relative risk for subsequent
cardiometabolic diseases (Graphical abstract, Figures 1 and 2, and
Supplementary material online, Table S1). In particular, each additional MC was significantly associated with increased risk for diabetes
mellitus, hypertension, congestive heart failure, cardiac dysrhythmias
and cardiac conduction disorders, ischaemic heart diseases, peripheral vascular diseases, and heart valve disorders (FDR <0.05).
Importantly, the absolute risk to develop any cardiometabolic disease
within 5 years in women with a pre-existing condition was 57.92%

material online, Table S1). In those analyses, the effect sizes and statistical significance remained largely unchanged, indicating that the
observed associations are independent of those reproductive and
life-style factors. Further, we have estimated the association of mammographic features with incident cardiometabolic diseases only in
women which did not develop BC during follow-up, again adjusted
for the same covariates as above. We found that exclusion of women
who developed BC during follow-up had little to no effect on the
observed associations (Supplementary material online, Figure S3 and
Supplementary material online, Table S1).

Genetic dissection of the observed
associations
To further investigate a potential genetic contribution to the
observed associations, we investigated the association of mammographic features present in KARMA women with cardiometabolic
diseases diagnosed in their sisters. We found that an elevated number
of MC observed in the KARMA participants was associated with a significantly increased risk for BC, diabetes, hypertension, and peripheral
vascular diseases in their sisters (Figure 2 and Supplementary material
online, Table S1, P < 0.05). In contrast to MC, a high dense breast in
KARMA women was associated reduced risk for diabetes mellitus,

..
.. chest pain, and peripheral vascular disease in their sisters (Figure 2), in
.. agreement with the effects observed in the KARMA women.
..
Next, we aimed to investigate whether BC genetics is also associ..
.. ated with cardiometabolic diseases and thus potentially implicate a
..
.. shared aetiology between BC and cardiometabolic diseases. To this

increased cardiometabolic mortality [hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.46 [1.10-1.94], P = 0.009, Table 2]. This corresponds to an increase in the mortality rate of women with MC
compared to women without MC of 0.23 per 1000 person-years. In
contrast, we found that dense breasts were associated with a
reduced mortality (HR and 95% CI: 0.64 [0.46-0.90], P = 0.01, mortality rate reduction of 0.25 per 1000 person-years, Table 2). After
additional adjustment for BMI and smoking status, we observed similar effect sizes for MC (Table 2) but the effect of dense breasts on
mortality was attenuated (HR and 95% CI: 0.86 [0.60-1.24], Table 2).
Importantly, in women with an existing cardiometabolic disease,
presence of MC was associated with a markedly increased risk of
death (HR and 95% CI: 1.79 [1.24-2.57], P = 0.002, mortality rate increase of 1.13 per 1000 person-years, Table 2) compared to women
with no MC, while we observed no such effect in women without
pre-existing cardiometabolic disease. Adjustment for additional lifestyle and reproductive factors did not change the observed associations further. In addition, we conducted a competing risk analyses
with cardiometabolic death and BC diagnosis as competing outcomes
(Table 2). In those analyses, we observed similar effect sizes as above,
indicating that a BC diagnosis does not constitute a significant competing event and censoring at BC diagnosis is sufficient. Finally, we
also restricted the same analyses outlined above to only deaths from
cardiovascular disease, as cardiovascular events are the most common reason for cardiometabolic mortality (Supplementary material
online, Table S2). In this analysis, we observed similar associations as
above, with slightly increased effect sizes observed for the association
of MC with cardiovascular mortality (HR and 95% CI: 1.94 [1.33-

Discussion
In this study, a higher number of microcalcifications resulted in an
increased occurrence of cardiometabolic diseases in KARMA participants and their sisters as well as in a higher cardiometabolic mortality
in women with pre-existing cardiometabolic diseases (Graphical abstract). In contrast, we showed that women with high dense breasts
as well as their sisters are less likely to be diagnosed with cardiometabolic diseases. Notably, a family history of BC and a BC-specific GRS
were generally associated with lower risk for cardiometabolic
diseases.
While it is important to understand diseases that contribute to
altered mammographic features, insights into the consequence of
mammographic features on cardiometabolic disease risk and mortality can primarily be inferred from the analysis of cardiometabolic disorders occurring after a mammogram. Overall, our results on
incident cardiometabolic diseases associated with MC agree with
prior cohort studies, which reported effect sizes comparable to
ours.50,51 It is important to note that most previous studies did not
account for cardiometabolic disease diagnoses before the mammogram. However, our results indicate MC increase cardiometabolic
risk particularly in women with pre-existing cardiometabolic disorders. Those findings, though, are less relevant for cardiometabolic

dysrhythmias. A potential explanation for the observed association
could be prior reports showing that post-menopausal women taking
HRT are at increased risk for arrhythmias55-57 as well as have higher
dense breasts.58 Therefore, increased levels of oestrogen in the body
seem to be a significant risk factor for arrhythmias as well as denser
breast tissue. Since we adjusted the analyses for current and previous
HRT as well as for menopausal status, our evidence suggests that
high oestrogen levels independent of those factors are responsible
for the increased occurrence of arrhythmias. Thus, even though
women with dense breast are at generally reduced risk for cardiometabolic diseases, their concomitant medications and overall hormonal
exposure should be considered when including breast density in risk
prediction and prevention efforts. Importantly, the associations we
describe for dense breasts were adjusted for the number of MC and
thus represent independent associations. Therefore, including breast
density might be useful to improve cardiometabolic risk prediction
based on MC alone, particularly in women without prior cardiometabolic diseases.
To ascertain a potential genetic overlap between cardiometabolic
disease risk and mammographic features, we investigated the occurrence of cardiometabolic diseases in sisters of KARMA women.
Those analyses are only feasible due to linkage of both KARMA
women and their sisters to the same nationwide registries with virtually no missing data, allowing accurate assessment of cardiometabolic
health in sisters. We observed generally consistent effect sizes in
both KARMA women and their sisters. This implicates that either
shared environment or shared genetics is indeed partially responsible
for the observed association. Therefore, we extended our PheWAS
to include strong genetic BC risk factors such as family history of BC
and GRS. Here, genetic BC risk factors were associated with reduced
cardiometabolic disease risk. Thus, the known BC genetics is unlikely
responsible for the observed associations with microcalcifications.
Identification of the actual shared genetic and environmental risk factors has the potential to reveal further insights into the shared molecular basis and thus warrants further studies.
It is important to note that the automated iCAD system used in
this study has been developed to identify calcifications that are
markers for BC and may not necessarily be able to identify all arterial
calcifications. In addition, the approach cannot distinguish between
arterial and non-arterial MC but is likely detecting both at the same
time. Consequently, additional research is necessary to see whether
BC risk-associated MC and breast arterial calcifications are differentially influencing cardiometabolic risk. Furthermore, the observed
associations are likely underestimating the true effect sizes and thus a
novel automated assessment of breast arterial calcifications could
provide even more accurate cardiometabolic health assessment, particularly if the training includes relevant outcome measures such as
cardiometabolic disease incidence or mortality. Nevertheless, in our
sensitivity analyses, we found that excluding women that developed
BC during follow-up did not change the observed associations. This
finding strongly suggests that the iCAD system is able to capture not
only MC due to breast hyperplasia but also those MC that predispose for cardiometabolic risk and mortality. Therefore, using the
iCAD system as an automated assessment of MC promises a rapid
and cost-effective estimation of cardiometabolic health in women.
Such an application to existing screening programmes is particularly
warranted since women are at greater risk of cardiometabolic

risk prediction because predicting disease risk in already diseased
individuals is unlikely to have a major impact. Nevertheless, ascertaining the presence of MC in mammograms could still be beneficial in
these women since we found that the presence of MC was a sign of
worse cardiometabolic health and thus associated with increased cardiometabolic mortality, mostly due to cardiovascular complications.
Therefore, a detailed medical history of cardiometabolic diseases
seems to be vital to precisely assess risk for cardiometabolic mortality in women attending mammographic screenings. In addition, the
underlying mechanisms that result in increased cardiometabolic mortality due to MC in women with and not in women without preexisting cardiometabolic disease need further research. As such,
detailed genetic and molecular dissection of the presence of MC in
women with and without pre-existing cardiometabolic diseases is
warranted, with particular focus on those microcalcifications that are
indicative of cardiometabolic death.
In contrast to the results observed in women with pre-existing
cardiometabolic diseases, no significant effect of MC on cardiometabolic mortality was observed in healthy women. In addition, despite a comparable number of cardiometabolic disease diagnoses in
women with and without prior cardiometabolic diseases, we
found fewer and generally weaker statistically significant associations of MC with incident diseases in healthy women.
Consequently, accurate assessment of the risk increase due to
MC in healthy women is crucial to avoid over-estimating their risk
for cardiometabolic diseases. Despite the reduced effect sizes of
MC on the risk for cardiometabolic diseases in healthy women,
our results still revealed a crucial insight: the effect sizes observed
for statistically significant increased cardiometabolic risk due to
MC are comparable to the effect sizes observed for BC risk (i.e.
about 10% increased risk per MC). This indicates that MC are indeed a strong risk factor for cardiometabolic disease, with each
additional microcalcification having comparable effect size to a 5point increase in BMI.52,53 The presented results therefore reinforce the notion that MC identified in routine mammographic
screening have the potential to improve current risk prediction
algorithms21,54 even in the absence of pre-existing cardiometabolic
diseases.
Importantly, we found that increased breast density was associated
with a reduced incidence of cardiometabolic diseases, especially in
women without pre-existing cardiometabolic diseases. Conversely,
women with a low dense breast are at increased risk for cardiometabolic diseases. Potentially, those findings could be explained by the
contrasting influence of BMI on breast density and cardiometabolic
diseases, particularly diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases.
However, we adjusted our analyses for BMI and found no association
of prevalent diabetes mellitus with breast density (data not shown),
indicating that our adjustments sufficiently accounted for differences
in BMI. Nevertheless, we have not ascertained and accounted for all
risk factors for cardiometabolic diseases such as blood lipid levels;
thus, residual confounding by those variables could still be responsible for the observed association.
Contrary to the generally reduced risk for cardiometabolic diseases observed for women with dense breasts, we found that women
with dense breasts had increased risk for incident cardiac dysrhythmias. This is surprising since women with high dense breasts have
fewer cardiometabolic disorders that are known risk factors for

mortality than men and generally have poorer prognosis following an
acute cardiovascular event. Since the iCAD system is FDA approved
and in use at several sites indicating that a rapid clinical implication of
our findings is feasible. To this end, women with adverse mammographic features (i.e. more MC or lower dense breasts, automatically
assessed via the iCAD system and STRATUS) and/or pre-existing
cardiometabolic disease will need to be included in a clinical trial. In
these women, the efficacy of cardioprotective measures according to
established guidelines59 or with a specifically tailored regime should
be assessed, thus paving the way to reduce cardiometabolic mortality
in our ageing population.
Taken together, we found that an increased number of microcalcifications were associated with elevated risk for cardiometabolic diseases and mortality particularly in women with pre-existing
cardiometabolic diseases. In contrast, high mammographic density
was associated with reduced cardiometabolic disease risk, predominantly in women without pre-existing cardiometabolic diseases. Our
results indicate that automated quantification of microcalcifications
and breast density could be useful at no additional cost or radiation
to improve cardiometabolic risk prediction in women attending
mammographic screenings. Crucially, automated assessment of mammographic routine screening images might be suitable to identify
women with poor cardiometabolic health at-risk for cardiometabolic
death.
