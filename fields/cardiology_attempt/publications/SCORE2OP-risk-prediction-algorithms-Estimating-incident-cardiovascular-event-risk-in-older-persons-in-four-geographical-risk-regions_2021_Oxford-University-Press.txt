Aims

The aim of this study was to derive and validate the SCORE2-Older Persons (SCORE2-OP) risk model to estimate
5- and 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in individuals aged over 70 years in four geographical risk
regions.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
Sex-specific competing risk-adjusted models for estimating CVD risk (CVD mortality, myocardial infarction, or
and results
stroke) were derived in individuals aged over 65 without pre-existing atherosclerotic CVD from the Cohort of
Norway (28 503 individuals, 10 089 CVD events). Models included age, smoking status, diabetes, systolic blood
pressure, and total- and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Four geographical risk regions were defined based on
country-specific CVD mortality rates. Models were recalibrated to each region using region-specific estimated
CVD incidence rates and risk factor distributions. For external validation, we analysed data from 6 additional study
populations f338 615 individuals, 33 219 CVD validation cohorts, C-indices ranged between 0.63 [95% confidence
interval (CI) 0.61-0.65] and 0.67 (0.64-0.69)g. Regional calibration of expected-vs.-observed risks was satisfactory.
For given risk factor profiles, there was substantial variation across the four risk regions in the estimated 10-year
CVD event risk.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusions
The competing risk-adjusted SCORE2-OP model was derived, recalibrated, and externally validated to estimate 5-

and 10-year CVD risk in older adults (aged 70 years or older) in four geographical risk regions. These models can
be used for communicating the risk of CVD and potential benefit from risk factor treatment and may facilitate
shared decision-making between clinicians and patients in CVD risk management in older persons.

Introduction
Risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) increases with age.1 The risk of
non-CVD mortality generally also rises with age so that remaining life
expectancy inevitably decreases with age. Hence, the treatment of
important CVD risk factors needs to be carefully considered to balance the benefits and risks in this population. Meaningful treatment
benefit is different in this population where life expectancy is limited,2,3 while older persons are generally at high risk of developing adverse drug events and side effects.4,5 It is thus important to identify
those individuals who might benefit from preventive treatment.
For this purpose, CVD risk prediction models can be used to identify those at higher risk of CVD and those potentially benefiting the
most from risk factor treatment.6 These prediction models may also
aid in patient-centred clinical decision-making, taking into account
other patient characteristics such as frailty, biological age, and patient
preferences.7

Most of the 10-year CVD risk prediction models generally have a
poor performance in older individuals for several reasons.8-11 First,
the relationship between traditional risk factors and CVD attenuates
with age,12 and traditional risk prediction models do not take into account competing risk of non-CVD mortality, leading to the overestimation of CVD risk and consequently overestimation of potential
benefit from risk factor treatment in older persons.3,13,14 This overestimation may lead to unnecessary treatment in older persons, polypharmacy, increased risk of drug interactions, adverse events,
reduced quality of life, and unnecessary costs.15 To deal with shortcomings of traditional risk models, an older person-specific risk score
should be used. However, previously developed risk models for
older persons only estimate risk of cardiovascular mortality while
non-fatal events are also of importance [e.g. stroke and heart failure
(HF)]. Finally, previous models have not been extensively externally
validated and shown to be applicable in different geographical risk
regions where risk levels vary.2,16,17

We aimed to develop and validate a competing risk-adjusted
model for individuals aged over 70 years without pre-existing CVD
to estimate 5- and 10-year risk of incident CVD-the new SCORE2Older Persons (SCORE2-OP). This risk model is calibrated to four
different geographical risk regions using an approach based on aggregate level data that can be easily applied to further update the accuracy of risk predictions with changing CVD epidemiology in the future.

Methods
Study design
The SCORE2-OP project involved several interrelated components and
data sources (Figure 1). The study design is closely related to the new
SCORE2 model that estimates 10-year fatal and non-fatal CVD risk in
individuals without previous CVD or diabetes aged 40-69 years.18 First,
model coefficients were derived in the Cohort of Norway (CONOR)
study.19 This study population was selected because it is a large, representative population-based cohort and has previously been used for model
derivation.16,17,20 Second, the model was recalibrated to four geographical risk regions across Europe and beyond using estimated contemporary
age- and sex-specific incidences and risk factor distributions. Third,

.. external validation was performed in prospective cohorts from different
... risk regions. Finally, the model was applied to estimate individualized
..
.. treatment benefit from blood pressure and cholesterol lowering to illus.. trate how SCORE2-OP can be used for treatment decision-making in
..
.. clinical practice.

Endpoint definitions

Risk regions
The four risk regions (low, moderate, high, and very high risk) were
chosen based on the definition used in the newly developed SCORE2
risk model, according to the most recent overall age- and sex-standardized CVD mortality rates in all included countries (ICD 10 chapter IX,
I00-I99). The following age-standardized rates were used for categorization: <100 CVD deaths per 100 000 (low risk), 100-149 CVD deaths per
100 000 (moderate risk), 150-299 CVD deaths per 100 000 (high risk),
and >_300 CVD deaths per 100 000 (very high risk). The four geographical
risk regions are found in Supplementary material online, Figure S1 and
Supplementary material online, Table S2.

Statistical analysis
Details of statistical analysis are provided in Supplementary material online, Methods. For model derivation, sex-specific coefficients were estimated in the CONOR study using competing risk-adjusted Fine and Gray
proportional subdistribution hazards models. The models included the
following pre-specified baseline predictors: age, current smoking, diabetes
mellitus, systolic blood pressure (SBP), total cholesterol (TC), and highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c). The risk factors were selected
based on their predictive ability as well as availability in the derivation
dataset and population statistics needed for model recalibration. Variable
selection was not applied to prevent overfitting of the model to the derivation data (over-optimism). Age interaction terms were added as the effect of these risk factors may change with age.28 To maximise statistical
power when estimating age-interactions, risk models were derived in participants aged 65 and older at baseline without previous CVD. However,
SCORE2-OP risk models are intended for use in people aged over 70
years. In a parallel iniative a score for individuals aged below 70, SCORE2OP, has been developed using similar methods.18 Continuous predictors
were truncated at the 1st and 99th percentiles to minimize the influence
of outliers in the model.29 Whether the association of continuous predictors with the outcome variable was adequately explained with a log-linear
relationship was assessed using the Akaike information criterion. Internal
model performance was assessed with Harrell's C-index for discrimination, and visually with calibration plots of estimated vs. observed risk in a
random sample with replacement of the CONOR study population to
account for overfitting. The model was then recalibrated internally for
the risk of the secondary CVD endpoint including HF using age- and sexspecific multiplication factors, using the same model coefficients.
Risk models were recalibrated to risk regions using age- and sex-specific mean risk factor levels and CVD incidence rates.30 Age-specific and
sex-specific risk factor values were obtained from the Non-

The primary endpoint was a composite of the first fatal or non-fatal CVD
events in each study participant, defined as non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, and cardiovascular mortality. Secondary endpoint
included also hospitalization from HF, as this is an important source of
morbidity and loss in quality of life in older persons.
The CVD mortality component of the primary and secondary outcomes resembles the endpoint definition of the original SCORE project,
including death from coronary heart disease, HF, stroke, and sudden
death. An overview of the ICD-10 codes included in both the fatal and
non-fatal components of the composite endpoint can be found in
Supplementary material online, Table S1. Deaths from non-CVD were
treated as competing events. Follow-up time was defined as years until
the first event, death, or end of the registration period.

In the internal validation set of the CONOR study, the 10-year
estimated risk showed good agreement with the 10-year observed
risk over all deciles for all outcomes of interest (Supplementary material online, Figure S3). C-index was 0.66 [95% confidence interval
(CI) 0.65-0.66] for CVD events and 0.65 (95% CI 0.65-0.66) for
CVD events including HF. The age- and sex-specific multiplication
factors for estimating the risk of CVD events including HF can be
found in Supplementary material online, Table S4.
Age- and sex-specific 10-year mortality CVD rates and derived incidence rates are shown for each region in Supplementary material
online, Figure S4. The age- and sex-specific mean risk factor levels and
estimated CVD event rates used for recalibration are presented by
region in Supplementary material online, Table S5. After regional
recalibration, SCORE2-OP estimated risks based on mean risk factor
levels agreed well with the regional estimated CVD event incidence
in the four risk regions across age-groups (Supplementary material
online, Figure S5).
In the external validation study populations, a total of 33 219 primary outcome events were observed in 338 615 individuals in 2 259
933 person-years of follow-up. The external validation showed Cindex for discrimination (Figure 2) ranging between 0.63 (95% CI
0.61-0.65) and 0.67 (95% CI 0.64-0.69). Calibration plots per study
population after accounting for differences in baseline risk are shown
in Supplementary material online, Figure S6. For the secondary CVD
endpoint including HF, the external C-index ranged between 0.63
(95% CI 0.61-0.65) and 0.67 (95% CI 0.65-0.69). When we applied
the recalibrated SCORE2-OP models from each risk region to individual risk factor data from participants from ARIC and MESA, the
risk distribution varied greatly between risk regions (Supplementary
material online, Figure S7). Comparison of SCORE2-OP and the
ASCVD risk engine can be found in Supplementary material online,
Table S6. C-index for SCORE2-OP was comparable to or higher than
for ASCVD in the other study populations. In the external validation

according to non-HDL-c rather than TC and HDL-c. We have also
added risk charts for the estimated 5-year risk charts are now in
Supplementary material online, Figure S8, as this may fulfil a clinical
need especially in the very old. The estimated absolute risk for a
given age and combination of risk factors differed substantially across
regions. For example, the estimated 10-year CVD risk for a 75-yearold male smoker with a systolic blood pressure of 150 mmHg, and a
non-HDL-c of 4.5, ranged from 16% in a low risk country to 37% in a
very high-risk country (Supplementary material online, Figure S9).
Similarly, the 10-year risk for a 75-year-old woman with the same
risk factor profile ranged from 14% in a low risk country to 44% in a
very high-risk country. A sensitivity analysis taking into account uncertainty around individual predictions is described in the
Supplementary material online, Methods and shown in

older individuals aged over 70 years without pre-existing CVD-
SCORE2-OP to estimate 5- and 10-year risk of incident CVD
(Graphical Abstract). There is a wide range in estimated individual
CVD event risk in older persons. Using SCORE2-OP, individualized effects of CVD risk factor treatment can be estimated, e.g.
from blood pressure lowering or lipid lowering, which can be
used for treatment decision-making in clinical practice. The full
clinical tool for individualized estimations will be made available
to use in online calculators.
In the SCORE2-OP project investigators from three previously
published older person CV risk algorithms joined forces by combining datasets and using advanced methodology for data analyses. The
original SCORE-OP model,16 derived in >40 000 European older
individuals (including participants from the CONOR study) estimated
risk of fatal CVD. However, it did not take into account non-fatal
CVD events (such as non-fatal stroke) that are clinically relevant in
older persons, and was not adjusted for competing non-CVD mortality risk. Another risk model derived in CONOR is the NORRISK2
model for CVD risk estimation in elderly men and women up to age
79 years.17 This risk score is competing risk adjusted, includes

interaction terms with age, and was externally validated within
Norway, but it was not recalibrated or externally validated outside
Norway. In addition, it was not derived specifically in older persons,
including persons aged <65 years.17,20 The older person-specific risk
score derived in the PROSPER trial is competing risk adjusted, and
estimates the risk of fatal and non-fatal CVD events.2 However, this
risk model was derived in a relatively small study population from a
randomized clinical trial and did not include age interactions.
The SCORE2-OP model has combined these previous efforts and
as such has several important strengths and advantages. First, the
coefficients been derived in a large population-based cohort study,
specifically in older persons. The model has been externally validated
in populations with different baseline risks including both cohorts and
trials from several countries. It was shown that SCORE2-OP recalibrated to the different risk regions corresponds well to the regional
estimated WHO incidence rates, suggesting that calibration between
estimated and observed risk is good for all risk regions. Although the
discrimination in the external study populations is only moderate, the
excellent calibration shows that the risk model can be used for clinical decision-making and risk communication. For this purpose,

calibration is arguably the more important metric than discrimination.40 Use of the risk model in regions outside of the included countries should be done with caution, as no validation has (yet) been
performed outside of these regions.
Second, SCORE2-OP can be used to estimate the risk for the
combined outcome of both fatal and non-fatal CVD events.
Especially in older persons, non-fatal CVD events may be of clinical
importance, as they may severely impact quality of life. The model
also gives the option to include hospitalization for HF in the composite endpoint, which is an important source of morbidity in the older
population.41 In clinical practice, this may therefore be a very relevant
endpoint for older persons especially when considering the consequences of HF for quality of life.
Third, the model is competing risk adjusted and includes age-interactions for all risk factors to account for differences in the relationship between risk factors and outcomes across different ages. This
allows for estimations of 5- and 10-year prognosis truly tailored to
the individual person.
Fourth, the model has been recalibrated using contemporary CVD
rates currently available for the different risk regions using WHO

data. The method used for systematic recalibration has previously
been shown to give reliable estimations with good agreement between estimated and observed risks.30 The recalibration methods
avoid reliance on sparse or unreliable cohort or country-level data,
providing stable recalibrations using age- and sex-specific CVD rates
and risk factor levels of each risk region. Due to the flexible recalibration approach based on the most recent registry data, the model can
easily be updated in the future to accommodate changes in CVD risk
and risk factor levels in populations over time. If individual countries
or even regions within a country have reliable data sources available,
the model may even be recalibrated for even more precise risk estimations in that country or region. Because the same risk regions and
data sources were used for systematic recalibration of SCORE2-OP
as used in the SCORE2 project,18 these two models can be used next
to each other with persons naturally progressing from the SCORE2
model to SCORE2-OP as they get older.
Finally, the model can be used to estimate the absolute CVD risk
reduction from blood pressure and cholesterol lowering to blood
pressure and LDL-cholesterol treatment goals, by applying the
HRs from meta-analyses or clinical trials in older persons to the

across time.18 As such, we believe that this assumption is sufficiently
met to give reliable estimations of total CVD event risk after systematic recalibration.
Third, part of the European validation data consisted of trial populations rather than unselected cohort data. Whereas the discrimination in our cohort populations was acceptable, especially compared
to discrimination of a general risk model (namely ASCVD) in the
same populations, slightly lower C-indices were reported in the external validation in the trial populations. Trial populations often make
up a much more selected proportion of the population at large in
comparison to cohort data (e.g. HYVET only contains patients aged
80 years or older, with SBP ranging from 156 to 200 mmHg) and the
maximum C-index is strongly associated to the distribution of risk
within a study population.40 Therefore, it is likely that the discrimination in these trials is an underestimation of the discrimination in reallife populations. As regional calibration (i.e. goodness of fit of the
model) is satisfactory for all risk regions, the model can be used reliably for risk communication and treatment decisions in older
persons.
Fourth, during model derivation in CONOR, no adjustment was
made for treatment of risk factors at baseline. The assumption is
made that, for example for cholesterol or blood pressure levels, the
current risk factor level is predictive of the 10-year risk, regardless of
whether this is treated or untreated. SCORE2-OP can thus be used
for estimating 10-year risk in both untreated and treated individuals.
However, caution should be given when risk factor treatment has
been recently initiated. However, SCORE2-OP can be used for making treatment decisions in persons on a stable treatment regimen.
Together with the fact that only one baseline risk factor measurement was used, which means that there may be underestimation of
risk associations due to 'regression dilution',47,48 this may contribute
to the relatively low discrimination. In addition, no adjustment was
made for the potential initiation of risk factor treatment during study
follow-up, which may also influence discrimination. However, it has
been shown that accounting for statin drop-in during follow-up in
model development had only a limited impact on model
performance.49
Fifth, predictors related to co-morbidity or frailty (e.g. kidney
function, height and body weight, co-morbidity at baseline) may be
important determinants for CVD risk in older persons but were
not included in SCORE2-OP due to the availability in the data sources. Including the number of drugs used as a measure of co-morbidity added to the predictive accuracy in the PROSPER older
person score,25 but this variable was not available in all relevant
data sources.
Finally, an inherent limitation of absolute risk estimations is that
older individuals are invariably at higher risk for CVD than younger
individuals with the same risk factors. As higher CVD risk translates
to higher absolute risk reductions, this may give the impression that
risk factors such as blood pressure and LDL-cholesterol should always be treated in the very old. It should be noted that 5- or 10-year
CVD risk estimation should be combined with some assessment of
treatment benefit, as life expectancy could be limited, together with
patient preferences to make individual treatment decisions. For this
purpose, lifetime treatment benefit approaches could be used, such
as the LIFE-CVD model for primary prevention.44

SCORE2-OP risk estimations. Higher levels of non-HDL-c confer a
smaller increase in CV risk in older persons compared to young and
middle-aged people. It should be noted that lowering cholesterol
produces significant reductions in major vascular events irrespective
of age, although there is still less direct evidence of benefit among
people older than 75 years without a history of previous vascular disease.42 In general older persons are at high 10-year CVD risk as age is
a major driver of risk. For older persons, there is currently no CVD
risk threshold for initiating risk factor lowering treatment in international guidelines. Should those thresholds appear, these may differ
according to age as both the potential harms and the gain in CVDfree life expectancy from preventive therapy heavily depend on age.
National and international guidelines need to consider (different)
treatment thresholds for young, middle-aged, and older persons. For
example, the Norwegian guideline for the primary prevention of
CVD has a graded recommendation for the consideration of intervention with pharmacological risk factor management (10-year CV
risk over 5% in ages 45-54 years, over 10% in ages 55-64 years, and
over 15% in ages 65-74 years).43 Using the SCORE2-OP model, no
uncertainty regarding individual predictions was estimated. Ten-year
risk of CVD events can already be hard to interpret in clinical practice
and having to interpret confidence intervals as well might make risk
communication even more difficult, rather than more informed.
Clinicians who want to incorporate the uncertainty of treatment
decisions could consider adding the confidence intervals from metaanalyses or trials in the calculation of the ARR.
Estimation of absolute benefit may therefore guide treatment decisions in a shared decision-making process taking frailty, biological age,
and patient preferences into account. Although on average the CVD
risk is high in older persons, the current study shows that there is a
wide distribution in 10-year CVD event risk in older persons and that
risk factor treatment does not necessarily yield a clinically significant
benefit in all older persons. Therefore, in the future, it might be interest to focus more on lifetime benefit from risk factor treatment based
on lifetime CVD risk calculators.44-46
Several potential limitations of the current study should also be
considered. First, the model was developed in a cohort study from
the low-risk region alone. As such, the assumption is made that the
model coefficients are transferrable to other risk regions. Previous
studies have indeed shown homogeneity of model coefficients across
different geographical regions and also across time for a CVD risk
model, indicating transferability of model coefficients across different
populations.18,28 Results from the current study have shown that discrimination was adequate in all countries where external validation
was performed, indicating transferability of model coefficients was
valid, although this validation could not be performed in all risk
regions due to the lack of adequate data. Ideally, the SCORE2-OP algorithm should be validated in those regions as soon as reliable data
are available in these regions.
Second, for the systematic recalibration approach estimated total
CVD event incidence rates rather than observed CVD event incidence rates were used within the four risk regions by using a multiplier-based approach. This approach is based on the assumption that
the multipliers are valid across all countries within the same risk region. Previous studies have shown that the multipliers showed good
consistency across both different cohorts from the same region and

SCORE2-OP risk prediction algorithms

In conclusion, the competing risk-adjusted SCORE2-OP model to
estimate 5- and 10-year CVD event risk in persons aged over 70
years was derived, recalibrated, and externally validated in four risk
regions. These models can be used for communicating the risk of
CVD events and potential benefits from risk factor treatment and
may facilitate shared decision-making in CVD risk management in
older persons.
