Aims

Little is known about the trade-off between the health benefits of physical activity (PA) and the potential harmful
effects of increased exposure to air pollution during outdoor PA. We examined the association of the combined
effects of air pollution and changes in PA with cardiovascular disease (CVD) in young adults.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
This nationwide cohort study included 1 469 972 young adults aged 20-39 years. Air pollution exposure was estiand results
mated by the annual average cumulative level of particulate matter (PM). PA was calculated as minutes of metabolic
equivalent tasks per week (MET-min/week) based on two consecutive health examinations from 2009 to 2012.
Compared with the participants exposed to low-to-moderate levels of PM2.5 or PM10 who continuously engaged
in >_1000 MET-min/week of PA, those who decreased their PA from >_1000 MET-min/week to 1-499 MET-min/
week [PM10 adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.22; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00-1.48] and to 0 MET-min/week
(physically inactive; PM10 aHR 1.38; 95% CI 1.07-1.78) had an increased risk of CVD (P for trend <0.01). Among
participants exposed to high levels of PM2.5 or PM10, the risk of CVD was elevated with an increase in PA above
1000 MET-min/week.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
Reducing PA may lead to subsequent elevation of CVD risk in young adults exposed to low-to-moderate levels of
PM2.5 or PM10, whereas a large increase in PA in a high-pollution environment may adversely affect cardiovascular
health.

Introduction
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the most common cause of death
worldwide.1 The Global Burden of Disease study reported that 17
million global deaths per year between 2006 and 2016 were attributable to CVD, which surpasses the number of deaths from any other
disease.1 Therefore, the risk factors for CVD should be managed
properly considering its clinical importance.
Among CVD-related factors, the association of the combined
effects of air pollution and physical activity (PA) with CVD is becoming one of the most important public health issues. PA is well known
for its protective effects on CVD,2-5 whereas exposure to particulate
matter (PM) in air pollutants, such as PM2.5 and PM10, has been
reported to have detrimental effects on CVD.6-9 These reports imply
that outdoor PA in the presence of high levels of ambient air pollution may attenuate the protective effects of PA on CVD or even increase CVD risk. The trade-off between the health benefits of PA
and its potential detrimental effects due to increased exposure to air
pollutants during outdoor PA remains controversial.6
To date, only one study has investigated the combined effects of
air pollution and PA on CVD. The study found that engaging in a
higher frequency of moderate to vigorous PA decreased the risk of
CVD in participants exposed to both high and low levels of air pollution,10 but this study was conducted on middle-aged and older adults.
No study has examined the effects of changes in PA combined with
the effects of air pollution on cardiovascular health. Young adults are
more likely to have fewer cardiovascular risk factors and to be physically active than middle-aged and older adults.11,12 For these reasons,

with missing covariate values before the index date of 1 January 2013,
were excluded. Finally, a total of 1 469 972 participants were enrolled
and followed up from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2018. Figure 1
shows the selection flow diagram of the study population.
The Institutional Review Board of the Seoul National University
Hospital (IRB number: E-1911-133-1080) approved the study. The requirement for informed patient consent was waived because the NHIS cohort database is anonymized according to strict confidentiality guidelines.

Assessment of physical activity
PA was measured by a series of self-administered questionnaires during
the consecutive health examinations using a last 7-day recall method
which is reliable for monitoring PA levels of the population.15,16 Using the
responses to the NHIS survey from the two consecutive biennial health
examinations (2009-2010 and 2011-2012), we extracted the weekly frequencies of light-intensity (>_30 min/day; e.g. light exercise, walking for
leisure), moderate-intensity (>_30 min/day; e.g. fast/brisk walking, tennis,
slow cycling), and vigorous-intensity (>_20 min/day; e.g. running, aerobics,
fast cycling, mountain hiking) PA. Ratings of 2.9, 4.0, and 7.0 metabolic
equivalent tasks (METs) were applied to light, moderate, and vigorous
PA, respectively, based on a previous study.17 The total PA energy expenditure values in minutes of metabolic equivalent tasks per week
(MET-min/week) were calculated by summing the MET-min/week values
for each kind of PA considering frequency, intensity, and duration. We
categorized individuals into four groups of 0, 1-499, 500-999 (current
guideline recommendations18,19), and >_1000 MET-min/week of PA during the two consecutive screening periods, and the MET-min/week values
for the first and second screening periods were used to determine
changes in PA. The changes in PA were calculated by subtracting METmin/week values obtained during the first health screening period from
those obtained during the second health screening period.

Estimation of individual exposure to air
pollution
The National Ambient Air Monitoring System (NAMIS) (https://www.air
korea.or.kr) in South Korea provides monitoring data on ambient levels
of PM10 and PM2.5. Daily air pollution data are collected from 280 nationwide atmospheric monitoring sites. The monitoring sites are

.. allocated based on the number of residents, location of the residential
..
.. area, source of emissions, and area of the target monitoring site. Usually
.. at least one atmospheric monitoring station is allocated to each adminis..
.. trative residential district in metropolitan cities. This study included 73 ad.. ministrative residential districts located in all metropolitan cities in South
.. Korea. Most people lived in residential districts that were covered by at..
.. mospheric monitoring stations, except for those living in two residential
.. districts (0.8% of the total population) that were not monitored for
..
.. PM10. PM2.5 was only monitored in three major metropolitan cities
.. (Seoul, Busan, and Incheon) from 2009 to 2012. Therefore, a total of
.. 955 095 individuals living in 50 administrative residential districts in three
..
.. major metropolitan cities were included and were covered by atmos.. pheric monitoring stations, except for eight residential districts (7.9% of
..
.. the total population) that were not monitored for PM2.5. Air pollution
.. levels in these unmonitored districts were estimated using information
.. from the closest monitoring station. The baseline characteristics of partic..
.. ipants with PM2.5 data compared to the those without PM2.5 data were
.. assessed using descriptive statistics in Supplementary material online,
..
.. Table S1.
..
The air pollution data on each administrative residential district from
.. NAMIS
were linked with each participant using the residential district
..
.. codes provided by the NHIS database. In particular, in this process, we
.. collected data on the residences of each participant on a yearly basis and
..
.. linked them with the yearly average annual PM2.5 or PM10 levels based
.. on the residential districts of each year to accurately assess the exposure
.. levels to air pollution among migrant populations. Then, according to a
..
.. previous study's method,20 we calculated the 4-year average annual cu.. mulative PM2.5 or PM10 levels for each individual by computing the
..
.. mean of the annual PM2.5 or PM10 levels from 2009 to 2012, which
.. were linked based on the residential district of each participant and were
.. estimated as the level of air pollution exposure for each subject. The
..
.. amount of exposure to air pollution was categorized into two levels (low
.. to moderate vs. high) based on a cut-off value of the 66th percentile (3rd
..
.. tertile) of the range of exposure in this cohort.

on the American Heart Association guidelines, we used ICD-10 codes to
determine CVD events (ICD-10 codes I20-I25 and I60-I69), including
CHD (ICD-10 codes I20-I25) and stroke (ICD-10 codes I60-I69).21 To
include only genuine cases of CVD, we defined CVD outcomes in
patients with at least 2 days of hospitalization with ICD-10 codes related
to CVD.

(PM2.5 and PM10) and further the results from this model might also be
more likely to be valid than those from the single-pollutant model of each
pollutant.27,28
A two-sided P-value of <0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. All analyses, data collection, and data mining were performed
using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) and R programming
version 3.5.3 (the R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna,
Austria).

Results
A total of 8706 CVD events occurred during 8 779 364 person-years
of follow-up. The descriptive characteristics of study participants are
listed in Table 1. Among 1 469 972 participants, the mean (SD) age
was 32.3 (4.8) years and 886 844 were men. About one-fifth of the
participants were reported as physically inactive (18% in the first
health examination and 16% in the second health examination).
Women tended to be more physically inactive than men in both
health examinations. In addition, participants with PM2.5 data tended
to be more physically active, be exposed to higher level of PM10,
have higher household income, do not smoke, drink more alcohol,
and have lower SBP, FSG, and CCI compared with those without
PM2.5 data (Supplementary material online, Table S1). The data of
average annual cumulative PM2.5 or PM10 exposure levels from
2009 to 2012 and their changes from 2009 to 2012 are presented in
Supplementary material online, Table S2.
Figure 2 shows that a decrease in PA was associated with a higher
risk of CVD among participants with low-to-moderate levels of exposure to PM2.5. Among participants exposed to high levels of
PM2.5 or PM10, an increase in PA above 1000 MET-min/week had a
negative effect on cardiovascular health. Indeed, the significant effect
modification of the association between changes in PA and CVD risk
was identified by the level of PM2.5 exposure (P for interaction =
0.09, marginally attenuated). According to Figure 3, the association of
the combined effects of PM10 exposure and changes in PA with
CVD showed similar results and trends to that of PM2.5 exposure
and changes in PA with CVD. In particular, the significant effect modification of the association between changes in PA and CVD risk was
also identified by the level of PM10 exposure (P for interaction =
0.01) (Graphical Abstract).
The association of changes in PA strata with CVD risk stratified by
level of air pollution is depicted in Tables 2 and 3. Among participants
exposed to low-to-moderate levels of air pollution, those who
increased their PA from 0 MET-min/week (physically inactive) to
>_1000 MET-min/week [PM2.5 adjusted HR (aHR) 0.73; 95% CI 0.52-
1.03; P for trend 0.04] had a reduced risk of CVD compared with participants who were continuously physically inactive. Participants who
decreased their PA from >_1000 MET-min/week to 1-499 MET-min/
week (PM10 aHR 1.22; 95% CI 1.00-1.48) and 0 MET-min/week
(PM10 aHR 1.38; 95% CI 1.07-1.78) had an increased risk of CVD
compared with participants who maintained >_1000 MET-min/week
of PA. On the other hand, among groups exposed to high levels of air
pollution, increasing PA from physically inactive to >_1000 MET-min/
week tended to negate the risk-reducing effect of PA on CVD
(PM2.5 aHR 1.33; 95% CI 0.96-1.84). For CHD and stroke, the association of changes in PA strata with these outcomes stratified by level

The participants were followed up from 1 January 2013, and their data
were censored at the date of the first CVD event, death, or 31
December 2018, whichever came first. We conducted Cox proportional
regression analysis to assess the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence
intervals (CIs) for CVD including CHD and stroke according to the combined effects of exposure to air pollution and changes in PA. Restricted
cubic splines of changes in PA according to the level of exposure to
PM2.5 or PM10 were suggested to graphically estimate the association of
the combined effects of air pollution and changes in PA with CVD.22 In
accordance with previous studies, five knots were located at the 5th,
25th, 50th, 75th, and 95th percentiles of the change in MET-min/week of
PA.17,23 Subgroup analyses of CVD risk according to changes in PA stratified by sex, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, Charlson comorbidity
index (CCI), and presence of hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolaemia were also performed. We adjusted for the following covariates
in the Cox proportional regression model: age (continuous, years), sex
(categorical, male or female), district (categorical, metropolitan city),
household income (categorical, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th quartiles), smoking
status (categorical, never, past, and current smokers), alcohol intake (categorical, 0, 1 or 2, 3 or 4, and >_5 times per week), BMI (continuous, kg/
m2), systolic blood pressure (SBP) (continuous, mmHg), fasting serum
glucose (FSG) (continuous, mg/dL), total cholesterol (TCHO) (continuous, mg/dL), and CCI (continuous). Household income was assessed
according to each individual's insurance premium, and smoking status and
alcohol consumption were measured by a self-administered questionnaire during the health examination. CCI was estimated using an algorithm based on a previous study.24
In addition, four types of sensitivity analyses were conducted. First,
analyses were performed after excluding subjects with hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolaemia, and atrial fibrillation to strictly exclude the
possible influences of cardiovascular risk factors. We defined hypertension (SBP >_140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure >_90 mmHg or use of
antihypertensive mediation such as beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin II receptor
blocker), diabetes (FSG level >_126 mg/dL or use of antidiabetic medication), and hypercholesterolaemia (TCHO level >_ 240 mg/dL or use of
antiatherosclerotic medication such as statin) using laboratory tests and
the use of medication according to previous studies and atrial fibrillation
in patients with ICD-10 codes related to atrial fibrillation (ICD-10 code
I48).25,26 Second, we additionally conducted sensitivity analysis by adding
patients with <2 days of hospitalization and with ICD-10 codes related to
CVD as CVD outcomes to consider the possibility of the true events in
patients with <2 days of hospitalization. Third, sensitivity analysis was conducted after considering the change in levels of exposure to air pollution
and adjusting the baseline smoking status, alcohol intake, BMI, SBP, FSG,
TCHO, and CCI and their changes to consider the time-varying characteristics of the variables. Finally, we performed additional analyses using
two-pollutant model. The single-pollutant model used in this study is the
simplest model to identify the influence of a single air pollutant; however,
it may not be able to consider the impacts of the other air pollutants. In
the two-pollutant model, however, PM2.5 and PM10 levels were mutually
adjusted; although the two-pollutant model has potential for collinearity,
it enables the simultaneous consideration of the effects of air pollutants

continuously engaged in >_1000 MET-min/week of PA while
exposed to low-to-moderate levels of PM2.5, participants who
were exposed to higher levels of PM2.5 and decreased their PA

CVD risk (aHR 1.67; 95% CI 1.14-2.43).

Supplementary material online, Tables S5 and S6 show the results
of subgroup analyses stratifying the subjects by sex, BMI, smoking status, comorbidity (CCI), and presence of hypertension, diabetes, and
hypercholesterolaemia. The trends of association between the combined effects of air pollution and increase or decrease in PA and CVD
risk were similar in most subgroups.
The results of sensitivity analyses after excluding subjects with cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolaemia, and atrial fibrillation) (Supplementary material online, Figure
S1), adding patients with <2 days of hospitalization and with ICD-10
codes related to CVD as CVD outcomes (Supplementary material
online, Figure S2), considering the change in levels of exposure to air
pollution and the time-varying characteristics of various variables
(Supplementary material online, Figures S3 and S4), and using the
two-pollutant model (Supplementary material online, Figure S5) are
presented. In all sensitivity analyses, the results and trends were consistent with the main results. In particular, according to
Supplementary material online, Figure S4, a decrease in PA was associated with a greater risk of CVD in participants with reduced levels of
exposure to PM10 or PM2.5 in 2012 as compared to 2009. Among
participants with increased levels of exposure to air pollution in 2012
as compared to 2009, a large increase in PA had a negative impact on
cardiovascular health, although the statistical significance was attenuated in participants with PM10 exposure probably due to a relatively
small sample size.

Discussion
In this large, population-based, nationwide study, we showed realworld evidence that physically active young adults who decreased
their PA had an increased risk of CVD compared with those who
maintained their frequency of PA within groups with low-tomoderate levels of exposure to PM2.5 or PM10. In contrast, among
young adults exposed to high levels of PM2.5 or PM10, participants
who increased their PA above 1000 MET-min/week were at an
increased risk of CVD. We found a significant effect modification of
the association between changes in PA and CVD risk by the level of
exposure to PM2.5 or PM10. This is the first study to examine the association of the combined effects of air pollution and changes in PA
with CVD in young adults.
Until now, there has been little information on the trade-off between the cardiovascular health benefits of PA and the potential
harmful effects of increased exposure to air pollution during outdoor
PA. Furthermore, no study has examined the trade-off between the
potential cardiovascular harm caused by a decrease in PA and the
benefits to cardiovascular health from decreased exposure to air pollutants due to decreased outdoor PA. Multiple studies have focused
on the harmful impact of increased inhalation and deposition of air
pollutants due to rapid breathing during outdoor PA.29,30 In the direct
pathway, fine particles of PM2.5 are directly transmitted into the
blood stream and are deposited on target organs, causing

vasoconstriction, endothelial dysfunction, elevated blood pressure,
and platelet aggregation.31 In the indirect pathway, PM activates the
pulmonary oxidative stress and systemic inflammatory pathways,
which contribute to increasing the risk of CVD.32,33 The autonomic
nervous system is also activated by PM through specific lung receptors, resulting in imbalance of the autonomic nervous system and potentially elevated cardiac arrhythmia.32 Therefore, engaging in
outdoor PA in a polluted atmosphere might have detrimental effects
on cardiovascular health due to the increased inhalation of air pollutants in spite of the cardiovascular benefits of PA.30
In spite of the detrimental effects of air pollution on CVD
described above, PA may diminish the risk of CVD by improving cardiopulmonary function.34-36 Engaging in PA is helpful for enhancement of aerobic capacity and physical function, and it also reinforces
cardiorespiratory fitness.37 PA, especially aerobic training, improves
the compliance and reactivity of blood vessels, systemic immune
function, and cardiac output.38 Moreover, engaging in PA regularly is
a highly effective way to manage a variety of metabolic risk factors for
CVD, such as controlling body weight and reducing blood pressure,
systemic inflammation, atherogenic lipid profiles, haemoglobin A1C,
and insulin resistance.39 Decreased PA may reduce all these cardiovascular health benefits of regular PA and also damage peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptors, which contribute to myocyte

inflammation and insulin resistance.40 Currently, the European
Society of Cardiology and US Department of Health and Human
Services have reemphasized the importance and positive impacts of
PA, and engaging in at least 500-1000 MET-min/week of PA is recommended by current PA guidelines.11,18,19
It is clinically very important to determine the optimal patterns of
PA behaviours according to air pollution levels because air pollution
is an obstacle to active exercise, despite the clinical importance of PA
for young adults who have peak aerobic capacity.41,42 Our findings
showed that decreased PA was associated with elevated risk of CVD
in participants with low-to-moderate levels of exposure to PM2.5 or
PM10. Thus, our results support the need to encourage the maintenance of PA among young adults who are already physically active in
order to reduce the risk of CVD, especially for those with low-tomoderate levels of exposure to PM2.5 or PM10. However, the riskelevating effects upon decreasing PA tended to be attenuated in participants with high PM2.5 or PM10 exposure levels, implying that the
harmful effects of reducing PA, such as chronic reduction in cardiorespiratory fitness, may be attenuated by the positive effects of
reducing exposure to PM by reducing outdoor PA. Further studies
are warranted to compare the effects of these two factors.
In contrast, cardiovascular health deteriorated when PA was
increased above 1000 MET-min/week, which is above the current PA

guidelines, in environments with a high level of PM2.5 or PM10. Our
results indicate that damages to the cardiovascular system caused by
increased exposure to air pollutants during a large amount of outdoor PA may negate the health benefits of PA for CVD and rather aggravate the cardiovascular health of young adults. Therefore, for
young adults who are exposed to high levels of ambient air pollution,
engaging in PA while reducing exposure to air pollution by methods
such as air filtration systems should be encouraged to prevent the
negation of the benefits of PA to cardiovascular health. Furthermore,
our findings indicated that the change in levels of exposure to air pollution, especially an increase in levels of exposure to air pollution,
may also negate the positive effects of PA on CVD. Thus, at the

national level, policy intervention for reducing air pollution levels
would be necessary to maximize the health benefits of PA on CVD in
young adults.
Our study has multiple strengths. It is the first large, populationbased study to investigate the association of the combined effects of
air pollution and changes in PA with CVD in young adults aged 20-
39 years. Our findings are especially valuable because we suggest
whether young adults should increase or decrease their PA depending on the level of air pollution. The large number of participants
increases the generalizability of these results, and the reliable medical
claims record supports the validation of CVD events. In addition, the
analyses were performed after adjusting for significant metabolic

mediators of CVD, including SBP, FSG level, and TCHO level. We
also conducted extensive subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses
to enhance the reliability of the results and provided real-world evidence to encourage young adults not to decrease their PA when
exposed to low-to-moderate levels of air pollution and to increase
their PA in an environment considering the reduction of air
pollutants.
The study has some limitations. First, the survey of PA was not sufficient to estimate the amount of outdoor PA because of the absence
of data on whether the participants engaged in PA outdoors (e.g. running in a park) or indoors (e.g. running in a gym). There may be also
discordances between a participant's residence and where they

engage in PA regularly. However, according to the nationwide 2010
and 2012 Survey on Citizens' Sports Participation conducted biennially by the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism and Korea
Institute of Sports Science,43,44 the sports facilities or locations of
physical performance that Korean people often use are generally
those that are close to their residence. Furthermore, it was estimated
that approximately 90% of the Korean population engages in outdoor
PA, such as walking, mountain hiking, playing football, or cycling, close
to their residence. The majority of the contents of the questionnaires
used in our study also refer to outdoor PA, such as cycling, mountain
hiking, and tennis. Further studies are necessary to estimate the
amount of outdoor and indoor PA and validate the concordance

between the residence and location where PA is performed to precisely identify the combined effect of air pollution and changes in PA
on CVD in young adults. Second, recall bias may occur because the
data on the PA level were collected using self-reported questionnaires. However, because the validity and feasibility of the 'last 7-day
recall' method based on a self-reported PA questionnaire have been
confirmed by multiple researches monitoring PA levels of population,15,16 the data on the PA of participants in this study may be reliable. Third, population selection bias may occur when conducting
analyses using participants with PM2.5 data because PM2.5 was only
monitored in the three major metropolitan cities. Finally, we did not
investigate the short-term effects of exposure to air pollution.
Therefore, further studies are necessary to identify the association of
the combined effects of short-term exposure to air pollution and
changes in PA with CVD risk.

Conclusion
Among young adults with exposure to low-to-moderate levels of
PM2.5 or PM10, decrease in PA from continuously physically active
was associated with a greater risk of CVD. In contrast, cardiovascular
health deteriorated when PA was increased to a fairly high level,
above 1000 MET-min/week, among young adults with exposure to
high levels of PM2.5 or PM10. Therefore, at least maintaining PA levels is recommended for young adults who are already physically active with exposure to low-to-moderate levels of air pollution. In
addition, engaging in more PA in an environment considering the reduction of air pollutants would be necessary to prevent the adverse
impacts on cardiovascular health for young adults who are exposed
to high levels of ambient air pollution.
