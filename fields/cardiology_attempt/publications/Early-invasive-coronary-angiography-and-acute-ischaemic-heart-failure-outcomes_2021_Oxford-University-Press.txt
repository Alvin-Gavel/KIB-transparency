Aims

While myocardial ischaemia plays a major role in the pathogenesis of heart failure (HF), the indications for coronary angiography during acute HF are not established. We determined the association of early coronary angiography
during acute HF hospitalization with 2-year mortality, cardiovascular death, HF readmissions, and coronary
revascularization.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
In a two-stage sampling process, we identified acute HF patients who presented to 70 emergency departments in
and results
Ontario (April 2010 to March 2013) and determined whether they underwent early coronary angiography within

14 days after presentation using administrative databases. After clinical record review, we defined a cohort with
acute ischaemic HF as patients with at least one factor suggesting underlying ischaemic heart disease, including previous myocardial infarction, troponin elevation, or angina on presentation. We oversampled patients undergoing
angiography. We used inverse-probability-of-treatment weighting (IPTW) to adjust for baseline differences. Of
7239 patients with acute HF, 2994 met inclusion criteria [median age 75 (interquartile range 65-83) years; 40.9%
women]. Early angiography was performed in 1567 patients (52.3%) and was associated with lower all-cause mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61-0.90, P = 0.002], cardiovascular death (HR 0.72,
95% CI 0.56-0.93, P = 0.012), and HF readmissions (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.71-0.99, P = 0.042) after IPTW. Those
undergoing early angiography experienced higher rates of percutaneous coronary intervention (HR 2.58, 95% CI
1.73-3.86, P < 0.001) and coronary artery bypass grafting (HR 2.94, 95% CI 1.75-4.93, P < 0.001) within 2 years.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusions
Early coronary angiography was associated with lower all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death, HF readmissions,
and higher rates of coronary revascularization in acute HF patients with possible ischaemia.

the underlying CAD.5-7 While guidelines suggest considering an ischaemic aetiology in any episode of acute HF, there is no standard approach for identifying patients requiring investigation.8,9

The decision to pursue diagnostic coronary angiography is a considerable challenge in acute HF. This decision is generally guided by
the presence of ischaemic symptoms and signs, including chest pain
and troponin elevation, but these features are common in patients
hospitalized with HF, and their presence has been shown to be
poorly predictive of subsequent outcomes.10,11 There is wide variability in the rates of invasive angiography, highlighting the clinical
equipoise in its use in acute HF.12,13
We constructed a cohort of patients presenting with HF and at
least one feature suggestive of potential underlying CAD, which
included any of prior myocardial infarction (MI), troponin elevation,
or angina on presentation. Previously, we designated these patients
as presenting with syndromic acute ischaemic HF (AIHF).14 The
objectives of our study were to determine the association of early
coronary angiography with mortality, readmissions, and revascularization in patients with AIHF.

Methods
Data sources
The cohort and study design have been published previously.14 We initially identified patients who presented to an emergency department with
HF in Ontario, Canada, from 1 April 2010 to 31 March 2013, using the
National Ambulatory Care Reporting System (NACRS). Hospitalized
patients were identified using the Canadian Institute of Health
Information Discharge Abstract Database (CIHI-DAD). The CIHI-DAD
and CIHI Same-Day Surgery (CIHI-SDS) database were used to identify
in-hospital cardiac procedures.15 Patients were selected for detailed clinical chart review from academic, medium-sized (51-150 annual HF emergency visits), and large (>150 annual HF emergency visits) community
hospitals from 1 April 2010 to 31 March 2013 using stratified cluster

.. sampling.14 If there were multiple visits during the period, the first visit
..
.. was chosen for chart abstraction. Both the CIHI-DAD and NACRS use
.. the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases
..
.. and Related Health Problems (ICD-10-CA), with the diagnostic code I50
.. indicating a primary diagnosis of HF. The cohort accrual period from
.. 2010 to 2013 was utilized in order to capture long-term outcomes and
..
.. cardiovascular causes of death, which became available in 2017. Primary
.. data collection for the study began in 2015 and was completed in 2017,
..
.. when the analysis was initiated on a series of projects.14
..
Highly trained specialized nurse or physician abstractors collected data
..
.. on 140 patients from each of 13 academic and 30 large community hospi.. tals and 50 patients from each of 27 medium-sized community hospi.. tals.14 Clinical data were collected from hospital records using electronic
..
.. case report forms with automated range checks, double-data entry for
.. key variables, and preloaded medical record numbers to optimize admin..
.. istrative database linkage. Information was retrieved on demographics,
.. clinical characteristics, medications, laboratory tests, and cardiac imaging
.. as detailed previously.14 Coronary angiogram reports were retrieved and
..
.. reviewed for the presence and location of coronary stenoses.
..
The Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP) database was used to ex..
.. tract physician claims. The OHIP database, interRAI home care data,
.. home care database, and continuing care reporting system were used to
.. identify patients receiving palliative care. All data sources were compiled,
..
.. uniquely encoded, and analysed at ICES. The Registered Persons
.. Database (RPDB) was used to determine deaths, and cardiovascular
..
.. deaths were determined using the Office of the Registrar General data.. base. Research ethics board approval was obtained from all hospitals
.. prior to data abstraction.
..
..
..
.. Study design and participants
.. We identified patients with acute HF using the CIHI database (using the
..
.. ICD-10-CA code I50) and oversampled those undergoing early coronary
.. angiography to allow for a well-powered comparison. Patients were
.. included only if they met Framingham criteria for HF on chart review, and
..
.. were excluded if brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal pro BNP
.. (NT-proBNP) levels were not indicative of HF as per the Canadian
..
.. Cardiovascular Society guidelines.16 Patients with a most responsible
.. diagnosis of an acute coronary syndrome were not included. Early coron.. ary angiography was defined as invasive angiography performed within
..
.. 14 days of presentation, identified by Canadian Classification of
.. Interventions procedure code 3IP10 in the CIHI-DAD or CIHI-SDS, and
..
.. confirmed by clinical chart review.15 The 14-day period was selected to
.. allow for the inclusion of patients receiving either inpatient or short-term
.. post-discharge angiography. To remove individuals for whom angiog..
.. raphy would have a lower yield during the acute HF episode, we excluded
.. patients with a hospitalization for acute MI, coronary angiography, or
..
.. revascularization up to 3 months prior to admission. All included patients
.. were admitted acutely via the emergency department; those admitted for
.. elective cardiac catheterization were excluded. We also excluded
..
.. patients with invalid health insurance numbers, non-residents of Ontario,
.. HF as a secondary diagnosis, or palliative patients (Figure 1). We excluded
..
.. patients with contraindications to angiography, including creatinine
.. >_3.4 mg/dL (300 mmol/L), anaphylactic contrast allergy, stroke within
.. 3 months, active severe bleeding, platelet count <20  109/L, metastatic
..
.. malignancy, or the highest degree of frailty by the Hospital Frailty Risk
.. Score.17
..
..
..
.. Definitions
.. Troponin values were categorized as normal, greater than the upper limit

fraction >_50%), mid-range ejection fraction (HFmrEF, ejection fraction
40-49%), or reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF, ejection fraction <40%).
Any significant coronary stenosis was defined as luminal stenoses of
>_50% in the left main or >_70% in either the left anterior descending, circumflex, or right coronary arteries. Multivessel disease was defined as significant stenoses in any two of the three arteries or significant left main
disease.

Outcomes

Variable selection
Variables with the potential to impact outcomes in HF or predict coronary angiography in acute coronary syndromes were used to derive
weights for propensity score analyses.19,20 We adjusted for demographics
(age, sex, race), clinical features on arrival [transport by emergency medical services, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation,
cardiogenic shock (defined as a systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg for
> 30 min accompanied by signs of hypoperfusion requiring inotropic support), severity of dyspnoea at presentation, angina within 48 h of hospital
presentation], the validated EHMRG score for acute HF mortality risk,21-
23
comorbidities [prior MI, diabetes, hypertension, previous stroke, peripheral vascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),
dementia, malignancy, smoking, obesity, family history of CAD, hypercholesterolaemia, prior PCI, and prior CABG], investigations on arrival
[haemoglobin, sodium, creatinine, troponin (>ULN and MI range)], BNP,
atrial fibrillation/flutter, QRS duration, ST-depression on electrocardiogram, performance of echocardiography, and left ventricular ejection
fraction as assessed by echocardiography or other modalities (e.g. cardiac
magnetic resonance imaging, radionuclide angiography, or ventriculography) during the index hospitalization.

Statistical analysis
Continuous variables are presented as medians and interquartile ranges
and were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test. We used the v2 test
for the comparison of categorical variables. We used multiple logistic regression analysis to determine the predictors of early angiography, selecting those with a P-value < 0.25 on univariate analysis for entry into the
multivariable model.
We used inverse-probability-of-treatment weighting (IPTW) to determine a weight for each individual representing the inverse of the

.. probability of receiving the treatment actually received (angiography or
..
.. control).24 Multiple imputation was used to impute missing values via the
.. creation of six imputed datasets. In the imputation models for missing
..
we used each variable from the IPTW models (Supplementary ma... data,
.. terial online, Table S1), as well as the outcomes in the analysis models.
.. Within each imputed dataset, standardized differences were used to
.. compare baseline variables between the two exposure groups before
..
.. and after weighting. The maximum standardized differences across the
.. six imputed datasets are presented.
..
Primary and secondary outcomes were compared before and after
..
.. IPTW. Weighted Cox proportional hazard regression models were used
.. to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for each outcome at each timepoint of
..
.. interest, and the proportional hazards assumption was tested for
.. each model. Outcomes with competing risks were evaluated using
..
.. cause-specific hazard models with death as a competing event for hospi.. talizations, and non-cardiovascular death as a competing event for the
.. cardiovascular death outcome. Robust variance estimators were used
..
.. when fitting the weighted Cox regression models or the cause-specific
.. hazard models.25 All analyses were repeated within the three overlapping
..
.. cohort-defining subgroups (prior MI, troponin elevation >ULN, and an.. gina). Additionally, we conducted subgroup analyses to determine poten.. tial effect modification between incident or non-incident HF and early
..
.. angiography using Wald's test for interaction. If an interaction existed, we
.. stratified the analyses by the presence of new or known HF.
..
Weighted Kaplan-Meier survival curves and the adjusted log-rank test
..
.. were used to compare all-cause mortality between groups after IPTW.
.. Weighted cumulative incidence functions were used to compare the cu..
.. mulative incidence of cardiovascular death between groups, treating non.. cardiovascular death as a competing risk. Weighted cumulative incidence
..
.. functions were also used to compare incidence of PCI, CABG, and any
.. revascularization (either PCI or CABG) over time between the early angi.. ography and no angiography cohorts; in these analyses, time zero was
..
.. defined as (i) the date of diagnostic angiography procedure for the early
.. angiography cohort and (ii) day 14 for the no angiography cohort. P-val..
.. ues were derived from weighted univariate Fine-Gray models. All analy.. ses were performed with SAS version 9.4 statistical software (SAS
.. Institute, Cary, NC, USA). Prior to analysis, the protocol of this study, the
..
.. Invasive Coronary Angiography Early in Ischaemic Heart Failure (ICE-HF)
.. study, was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04245605).
..
..
..
..
..
..
.. Sensitivity analyses
..
.. We used the methods described by Lin et al.,26 to explore the potential
.. effect of unmeasured confounders on the association between early angi..
.. ography and all-cause mortality. The method infers robustness of the
.. findings, if after varying c (the magnitude of the HR for the unknown con..
.. founder, U), the upper limit of the confidence interval (CI) for the main
.. exposure HR is bounded by unity for the differing prevalence of U in the
.. two comparator arms (P1, P2).26 Additionally, utilization of non-invasive
..
.. ischaemic testing (i.e. single-photon emission computed tomography
.. myocardial perfusion, cardiac positron emission tomography imaging,
..
.. stress echocardiography, coronary computed tomography angiography,
.. exercise electrocardiogram) within 14 days was compared between the
.. early angiography and no angiography cohorts as determined by detailed
..
.. clinical chart review or physician claims data (using administrative data
.. codes that were previously published).15 Inverse-probability-of-treatment
.. weighting was then repeated, incorporating the performance of non..
. invasive testing as an additional covariate in the propensity score model.

The co-primary outcomes were all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.
Secondary outcomes included readmissions for all causes, acute MI, and
HF. We also examined revascularization with percutaneous coronary
intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.
Using the ICD-10-CA coding system we identified hospitalizations for
acute MI (codes I21 and I22) and readmissions for HF (code I50), which
have been validated previously.18 All outcomes were assessed at 2 years,
and revascularization outcomes were further examined at 90 days. To ensure that deaths occurring before angiography did not influence the
results (while also allowing enough time for angiography to occur), we
used a landmark design such that subjects who died within 14 days of the
index admission were excluded. Subjects were followed for outcome ascertainment from this 14-day landmark forward. Similarly, for the readmission analyses, subjects who died or were readmitted within 14 days
post-admission were excluded. Subjects were then followed forward for
outcome ascertainment from this 14-day landmark. For the analysis of
revascularization events after angiography, procedures occurring on or
after the date of angiography were considered to account for ad hoc PCI
procedures.

Figure 2 Clinical factors associated with early coronary angiography. Odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) represent the association between each characteristic and the performance of early
angiography. Only characteristics that were significantly different
between the two groups (Table 1) were included. Confidence intervals marked with an arrowhead were too large to include. Exact values were: cardiogenic shock: 2.47 (0.99-6.17); prior myocardial
infarction (MI): 3.05 (2.44-3.80). BP, blood pressure; CABG, coronary artery bypass graft; CAD, coronary artery disease; COPD,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; EF, ejection fraction; EMS,
emergency medical service; HFmrEF, heart failure with mid-range
ejection fraction; HFrEF, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction;
PCI, percutaneous coronary intervention.

Results
Study cohort
The study-eligible HF cohort included 6166 patients, of whom 4112
met the criteria for AIHF (Figure 1). After applying exclusion criteria,
2994 patients remained in the final study cohort, of whom 1567
(52.3%) underwent early coronary angiography and 1427 (47.7%) did
not. There were no losses to follow-up.

Clinical factors associated with coronary
angiography
Baseline clinical characteristics are reported in Table 1. Odds ratios
representing the association of each covariate with the performance
of early angiography are displayed in Figure 2. The means and standard
deviations used to calculate odds ratios for continuous variables are
also presented (Supplementary material online, Table S2). Factors
associated with higher odds of early angiography included prior MI,

Figure 4 Kaplan-Meier curve of all-cause mortality post-inverseprobability-of-treatment weighting. Early coronary angiography was
associated with reduced all-cause mortality.

IPTW, the first presentation creatinine (Supplementary material online, Figure S1a), peak (Supplementary material online, Figure S1b),
and pre-discharge (Supplementary material online, Figure S1c) creatinine distributions were very similar. Natriuretic peptide tests
were performed in 16.7% of early and 15.3% of no angiography
groups and were not significantly different between arms
(P = 0.330); median values were 493 (304-710) and 530 (343-742)
ng/L, respectively, which were also not significantly different between the two arms (P = 0.173).

Primary outcomes
The unadjusted and weighted co-primary outcomes for the two
exposure groups are reported in Table 2. In all, 914 all-cause
deaths were observed over a total of 4853 person-years of
follow-up. Before weighting, the early angiography group had
lower all-cause (unadjusted HR 0.51, 95% CI; 0.42-0.63, P < 0.001)
and cardiovascular mortality (unadjusted HR 0.55, 95% CI; 0.42-
0.72, P < 0.001) over 2 years. After IPTW, all-cause mortality

HF readmissions remained significantly lower (adjusted HR 0.84, 95%
CI 0.71-0.99, P = 0.042) in the early angiography group.

Angiographic findings and
revascularization outcomes
Among those who underwent early coronary angiography, 58.5% had
obstructive coronary disease (Supplementary material online, Table
S3a), and 17.6% had coronary revascularization within 90 days of angiography. In those who did not undergo early angiography, only 3.1%
had coronary revascularization within 90 days. Unadjusted and
weighted rates of revascularization at 90 days and 2 years are presented in Table 3. Unadjusted rates of PCI, CABG, and any revascularization were increased in the early angiography group at both
timepoints (all P < 0.001). After IPTW, the early angiography group
demonstrated higher 90-day rates of PCI (HR 4.14, 95% CI 2.53-6.79,
P < 0.001), CABG (HR 4.99, 95% CI 2.43-10.24, P < 0.001), and any
revascularization procedure (HR 4.69, 95% CI 3.11-7.08, P < 0.001).
Higher rates of revascularization persisted over 2 years for PCI (HR
2.58, 95% CI 1.73-3.86, P < 0.001), CABG (HR 2.94, 95% CI 1.75-4.93,
P < 0.001), and any revascularization (HR 2.82; 95% CI 2.06-3.86,
P < 0.001). Cumulative incidence functions for revascularization procedures post-IPTW are displayed in Supplementary material online,
Figures S4-S6. In those undergoing early angiography, obstructive CAD
(93.2% vs. 49.0%) and multivessel disease (69.2% vs. 29.9%) were present in significantly higher proportions of patients who underwent
revascularization during follow-up, than those who did not undergo
revascularization (both P < 0.001, see Supplementary material online,
Table S3b). Over 2-year follow-up, coronary revascularization was performed with PCI alone in 145 (42.9%), CABG surgery in 183 (54.1%),
and both procedures in 10 (3%) patients.

Subgroup analyses
The weighted HR for each outcome in the three cohort-defining subgroups is represented in Supplementary material online, Table S4.

..
.. The association between early angiography and lower all-cause mor.. tality remained significant in the subgroups of prior MI (HR 0.75, 95%
..
.. CI 0.60-0.95, P = 0.015), troponin elevation (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.62-
... 0.98, P = 0.034), and angina (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.58-0.97, P = 0.029).
.. There was a significant association of angiography with reduced car..
.. diovascular death (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.53-0.94, P = 0.018) and acute
.. MI readmissions (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.45-0.92, P = 0.017) in the sub..
.. group with prior MI. Each subgroup retained a significant increase in
.. all forms of revascularization with early angiography at both time..
.. points (all P <_ 0.025). Additionally, these associations were consistent
.. in those with troponin > ULN or in the MI range, with no significant

To determine whether coronary angiography was associated with

Discussion
Ischaemic heart disease is a common underlying cause of HF, conferring an increased risk of death and readmission compared with nonischaemic aetiologies.27 Ischaemia is also a trigger for the initiation
and exacerbation of acute decompensated HF.3-7,28 However, there
is a paucity of evidence for early invasive evaluation and revascularization of CAD in acute HF.6,28 Consequently, there are no clear guidelines regarding the selection of patients for coronary angiography,
nor are there studies clearly demonstrating the benefits of early testing.8,9 In this study of hospitalized AIHF, early coronary angiography
was associated with lower all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death,
and HF readmissions at 2 years. There were higher rates of coronary
revascularization at 90 days and 2 years when early angiography was
performed, suggesting that early intervention could contribute to
improved outcomes (Graphical abstract).
Our study expands the current understanding of the role of angiography in acute HF. The American College of Cardiology/American
Heart Association HF guidelines state that 'left heart catheterization
or coronary angiography is indicated for patients with HF and angina
and may be useful for those patients without angina'.29 However, this
recommendation was based on level C evidence (i.e. consensus opinion) and was not supported by published data. The European Society
of Cardiology guidelines for HF suggest that angiography is a Class IIa
recommendation in 'intermediate to high pre-test probability of
CAD and suggestions of ischemia on non-invasive ischemia testing',
but the level of evidence was grade C.9 Despite frequently having
ready access to cardiac catheterization facilities, there is no clear guidance on whether HF patients should be considered for
angiography.8,9,29
There are retrospective and prospective data to support revascularizing patients with CAD and chronic left ventricular systolic dysfunction,9 but there are comparatively little data in the setting of
hospitalized acute HF. While coronary angiography has been previously associated with improved all-cause mortality within 30 days of
worsening HF symptoms, the improved outcomes were only seen in
non-ischaemic HF and may have been confounded by imbalanced
clinical profiles favouring angiography.12 In contrast, OPTIMIZE-HF
demonstrated that in-hospital angiography was associated with
improved adjusted short-term (60-90 day) all-cause mortality and
rehospitalization in acute HF, but only in those with known CAD.28
Finally, while the STICHES trial found that surgical revascularization
reduced mortality and hospitalizations in chronic ischaemic left ventricular dysfunction, most enrolled patients were not acutely

decompensated.30 In our study, over 80% of patients had symptoms
at rest or with minimal exertion (thus precipitating hospitalization),
and we included those with reduced and preserved left ventricular
ejection fractions. We expand on these findings by demonstrating
sustained improvement in mortality and readmission outcomes up to
2 years in a broad cohort of patients with AIHF, of whom only a third
had prior MI. The improvement in outcomes was seen uniformly
across subgroups of those with angina, prior MI, and troponin elevation, indicating that patients with acute HF and any one of these three
characteristics may benefit from ischaemic testing.
The hypothesized potential benefit of early angiography in acute
HF is via coronary revascularization or the diagnostic certainty arising
from the knowledge that critical CAD is not present, thus obviating
the need for unneeded antiplatelet agents, which can cause bleeding,
and anti-anginal drugs that may lower blood pressure and limit the
ability to uptitrate evidence-based drugs. The increased rates of coronary revascularization observed in the early angiography cohort
lend strength to the hypothesis that angiography was associated with
improved outcomes, in part, by limiting the impact of ischaemic disease on the progression of HF and its associated adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Another possible mechanism of benefit is medical
therapy optimization directed at reducing underlying CAD-related
risk. Although this study did not examine detailed coronary anatomic
findings, the higher rates of surgical revascularization likely indicate
that our HF cohort had a broad range of CAD severity with a considerable proportion of complex disease. Our findings were not
explained by the use of non-invasive cardiac testing, as the significant
associations persisted after weighting for non-invasive testing within
the 14-day observation period.
Our study informs decision-making about coronary angiography in
acute HF, suggesting that early angiography should be strongly considered for those with HF and suspicion of underlying ischaemic heart
disease. The lack of interaction between incident and non-incident
HF refutes the notion that ischaemic evaluation primarily should be
considered at the first presentation of HF; rather, this observation
supports the ongoing re-evaluation of potential underlying ischaemia.
At each hospital presentation, the contribution of ischaemia should
be considered and, sometimes, repeat physiologic or anatomic evaluation may be required even when the coronary anatomy was defined
years before. While the presence of clinical features consistent with
ischaemia, such as angina and troponin elevation, could be a manifestation of ventricular dysfunction and hypertrophy in HF, they could
also be indicators of significant underlying coronary disease as
well.7,11 Additionally, the presence of angina or troponin elevation
are also poor prognostic indicators for adverse cardiovascular events
in both acute and chronic HF.31-34 Our study has many implications
for those with underlying severe coronary disease, as early angiography may lead to subsequent coronary revascularization.
Conversely, the absence of significant coronary disease (and diagnostic certainty provided by angiography) may lead to discontinuation of
non-beneficial therapies, since all pharmacotherapies have the potential to cause adverse effects. Importantly, the decision to perform coronary angiography should be coupled with good clinical judgement
regarding precipitants of acute HF, which may or may not be related
to coronary ischaemia. Our definition of AIHF was not inclusive of all
potential patients with HF with suspected underlying CAD, and further studies with expanded definitions may be useful in clarifying the

(Supplementary material online, Table S5). Additionally, in further
sensitivity analyses, we accounted for baseline differences in preadmission cardioprotective medications including angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, betaadrenoreceptor antagonists, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists,
anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (Supplementary material online, Table S6). After accounting for
these medications, we found that propensity-weighted outcomes
using IPTW remained significant with adjusted HRs of 0.73 (95% CI
0.61-0.88) for all-cause mortality (P = 0.001) and 0.73 (95% CI 0.56-
0.94) for cardiovascular death (P = 0.015).

breadth of the benefit of early ischaemic investigation. Finally, patients
undergoing early catheterization and coronary revascularization
exhibited high rates of multivessel disease, which could be amenable
to either percutaneous intervention or CABG surgery.
Contemporary changes in the frequency and distribution of revascularization procedures, with increasing use of PCI procedures over
time,35 and recommendations for a heart team approach,36 may have
an impact on outcomes after coronary angiography, which can be
assessed in future studies.

Our study has several potential limitations. There was likely heterogeneity in the institution-specific definitions of troponin elevation;
however, earlier studies suggest that the ULN is a good landmark to
define accentuated risk in acute HF.14,22 Our patients were sampled
from an earlier timeframe in order to allow for detailed chart review
and complete outcome capture and could have been impacted by
secular trends. However, recent studies have demonstrated a stabilization of utilization of both invasive and non-invasive ischaemic testing since 2011, indicating that the observed associations remain
relevant.15 We did not examine changes in the relative proportion of
revascularization procedures performed by PCI or CABG during
more recent time periods, which was beyond the scope of the current study. Second, the use of the landmark design to exclude
patients who died within 14 days of admission may have led to the exclusion of more severely ill patients, a typical characteristic of this design.37 Third, we did not have data describing the aetiology of HF
exacerbation. Fourth, although IPTW analysis accounts for measured
clinical features relevant to both the performance of angiography and
subsequent outcomes, unmeasured confounding may exist.
However, our findings were robust to potential confounders with
equivalent and greater magnitudes of effect that could have, hypothetically, large differences in prevalence between the two study
arms. Fifth, BNP was not available for most patients, and while there
is a potential for misclassification, the clinical diagnosis utilized both
validated criteria and a final diagnosis of HF in the discharge record.
Sixth, some patients may not be suitable or agreeable to the performance of invasive coronary angiography; for instance, patients in acute
HF may have been limited by the requirement for supine positioning
due to pulmonary oedema. However, the median time to angiography in the early catheterization group was 4 (3-7) days, and a 14day window, employed in our study, should be adequate time for decongestion of most patients to be able to undergo the procedure.
Finally, some patients may have possessed other contraindications
that were not captured by our study. In these cases, non-invasive cardiac testing may be preferred, but comparing the utility of imaging vs.
conservative management was outside the scope of the present
study and will require future study.

Conclusions
In conclusion, patients with AIHF who underwent early coronary
angiography exhibited reduced all-cause mortality, cardiovascular
mortality, and HF readmissions over 2 years, as well as higher rates of
revascularization. While randomized trial evidence is required to validate these results, this study suggests that early coronary angiography may benefit patients with acute HF and potential underlying
