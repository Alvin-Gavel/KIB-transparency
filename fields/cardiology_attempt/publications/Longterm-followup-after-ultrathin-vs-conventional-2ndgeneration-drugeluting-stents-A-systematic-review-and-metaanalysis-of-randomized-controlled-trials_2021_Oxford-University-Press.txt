Aims

Contemporary 2nd-generation thin-strut drug-eluting stents (DES) are considered standard of care for revascularization of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. A previous meta-analysis of 10 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 11 658 patients demonstrated a 16% reduction in the 1-year risk of target lesion failure
(TLF) with ultrathin-strut DES compared with conventional 2nd-generation thin-strut DES. Whether this benefit is
sustained longer term is not known, and newer trial data may inform these relative outcomes. We therefore
sought to perform an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs comparing clinical outcomes with
ultrathin-strut DES (<_70 mm strut thickness) with conventional 2nd-generation thin-strut DES.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
We performed a random-effects meta-analysis of all RCTs comparing ultrathin-strut DES to conventional 2nd-generation thin-strut DES. The pre-specified primary endpoint was long-term TLF, a composite of cardiac death, myoand results

cardial infarction (MI), or clinically driven target lesion revascularization (CD-TLR). Secondary endpoints included
the components of TLF, stent thrombosis (ST), and all-cause death. There were 16 eligible trials in which 20 701
patients were randomized. The weighted mean follow-up duration was 2.5 years. Ultrathin-strut DES were associated with a 15% reduction in long-term TLF compared with conventional 2nd-generation thin-strut DES [relative
risk (RR) 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76-0.96, P = 0.008] driven by a 25% reduction in CD-TLR (RR 0.75,
95% CI 0.62-0.92, P = 0.005). There were no significant differences between stent types in the risks of MI, ST, cardiac death, or all-cause mortality.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusions
At a mean follow-up of 2.5 years, ultrathin-strut DES reduced the risk of TLF, driven by less CD-TLR compared
with conventional 2nd-generation thin-strut DES, with similar risks of MI, ST, cardiac death, and all-cause mortality.

Introduction
Contemporary 2nd-generation drug-eluting stents (DES) are considered standard of care for revascularization of patients with coronary
artery disease (CAD) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and have improved safety and effectiveness compared with
1st-generation DES platforms.1,2 These clinical advances have arisen
from optimization of anti-proliferative agents,3 the use of more biocompatible polymers,4 and a reduction in stent strut thickness with
use of more malleable metal alloys.5 Despite these improvements,
conventional 2nd-generation thin-strut DES are not event-free and
remain associated with an ongoing risk of adverse clinical events beyond the 1st year of implantation.6
Ultrathin-strut DES (<_70 lm) with biodegradable polymers
were developed to further improve outcomes after PCI by
reducing vessel injury and late polymer-induced inflammation and
promoting more rapid endothelization. A previous meta-analysis
demonstrated that ultrathin-strut DES were associated with a significant reduction in the 1-year risk of target lesion failure (TLF)
compared with conventional 2nd-generation thin-strut DES.7
However, since this report, longer-term follow-up of prior studies has been reported and additional relevant trials have been
completed. We therefore performed an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
comparing clinical outcomes between ultrathin-strut and conventional 2nd-generation thin-strut DES.

Data extraction and analysis
Two authors (Y.A. and A.N.) independently abstracted the data from
included trials in duplicate, verified by a 3rd author (M.V.M.). Included
studies were assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool.10 Publication
bias was assessed using a funnel plot.
All outcomes were assessed by intention-to-treat. Random-effects
meta-analyses were performed using the restricted maximum likelihood
estimator. All outcomes were assessed as relative risks (RRs) at the time
of latest follow-up available for each trial. Additional analyses were performed to assess early events (<_1 year) and late events (>1 year) whenever such data were available. We used the I2 statistic to assess
heterogeneity.11 Sensitivity analyses were performed with a fixed-effect
model, using hazard ratios (HRs) as the outcome measure when
reported. We performed additional sensitivity analyses using incidence
rate ratios (IRRs) as the outcome measure, and a further sensitivity analysis looking only at trials included in the prior 2018 meta-analysis. We
also performed a Jackknife sensitivity analysis excluding each trial in turn
for the primary endpoint. We performed sensitivity analyses looking at
the types of ultrathin-strut and control stents. Pre-specified subgroup
analyses for the primary endpoint were performed according to age, sex,
diabetes, chronic kidney disease, presentation with acute coronary syndromes or ST-elevation MI, small vessels, long lesions, in-stent restenosis
lesions, and multivessel disease. Interactions between subgroups were
assessed with meta-regression using a mixed-effects model, with the subgroup characteristic as a moderator and the individual trial as a random
effect. A moderating effect of the length of follow-up was assessed using a
mixed-effects meta-analytical model with a random effect for each individual study, as well as tests for interaction between results at 1 year and
beyond 1 year. We also performed regression tests for the type of stent
used in both the ultrathin DES and control DES arms, the anti-proliferative drug used in the control DES arm, and the delta strut thickness between the two arms.
Mean values are expressed as mean +/- SD unless otherwise stated.
Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05. P-values are two-tailed and
were not adjusted for multiplicity. The statistical programming environment R12 with the metaphor package13 was used for all statistical
analyses.

The pre-specified primary endpoint was TLF, defined as a composite of
cardiac death, target-vessel myocardial infarction (TV-MI) or clinically
driven target lesion revascularization (CD-TLR), at the latest follow-up
reported. The TLF composite was only assessed if it was reported; i.e. if
the composite TLF rate was not provided in a study, summing of its individual components to provide a value for TLF was not performed.
Secondary pre-specified endpoints included target vessel failure [TVF; the
composite of cardiac death, TV-MI or clinically driven target vessel revascularization (CD-TVR)], the individual components of TLF and TVF, as
well as all myocardial infarction (MI), definite/probable and definite stent
thrombosis (ST) by Academic Research Consortium criteria,9 any revascularization, all-cause mortality, and non-cardiac death. If not specifically
reported, non-cardiac death was calculated as the difference between allcause mortality and cardiac death. The pre-specified definitions of TLF
and TVF used in each trial are summarized in Supplementary material online, Appendix Table S2. In some cases, there were slight deviations from
the standard TLF and TVF definitions, in which case the trial-specific definition was used.

all MI were consistent before and after 1 year (Pinteraction = 0.732).
Target-vessel MI outcomes were available from 14 studies with
19 999 randomized patients. As shown in Figure 3 bottom, there was
no significant difference between stent types for the risk of TV-MI at
time of latest follow-up (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.74-1.02, P = 0.078).
There was mild heterogeneity (I2 = 2.4%). Similarly, there were no
significant differences in the risks of early or later TV-MI noted between groups (Supplementary material online, Appendix Figures S13
and S14). The RRs between the stent types for TV-MI were consistent before and after 1 year (Pinteraction = 0.933).

Stent thrombosis
Definite or probable ST outcomes were available from 15 studies
with 20 371 randomized patients. As shown in Figure 4, at latest follow-up, there was no significant difference between ultrathin-strut
DES and conventional 2nd-generation thin-strut DES for the risk of
definite or probable ST (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.70-1.06, P = 0.162).
There was no heterogeneity (I2 = 0.0%). Similarly, there were no significant differences in the risk of early or later ST events between
stent types (Supplementary material online, Appendix Figures S15 and
S16). The RRs between the stent types for definite or probable ST
were consistent before and after 1 year (Pinteraction = 0.795). Nor
were there significant differences between stent types in the risk of
definite ST at any time period (Supplementary material online,
Appendix Figures S17 and S19).

Repeat revascularization
Clinically driven TLR outcomes were available from 15 studies with
20 371 randomized patients. As shown in Figure 5 top panel, at latest
follow-up, ultrathin-strut DES were associated with a reduced risk of
CD-TLR compared with conventional 2nd-generation thin-strut DES
(RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.62-0.92, P = 0.005). There was moderate heterogeneity (I2 = 43.6%). The reduction in early events did not reach

Cardiac death outcomes were available from 16 studies with
20 701 patients. As shown in Figure 6 middle, at latest follow-up, there
was no significant difference between ultrathin-strut DES and conventional thin-strut DES for the risk of cardiac death (RR 1.07, 95%
CI 0.90-1.27, P = 0.424). There was no heterogeneity (I2 = 0.0%).
Similarly, there were no differences between groups for the risks of
early or later cardiac death (Supplementary material online, Appendix
Figures S35 and S36). The RRs between stent types for cardiac death
were consistent before and after 1 year (Pinteraction = 0.599).
Non-cardiac death outcomes were available from 16 studies with
20 701 patients. As shown in Figure 6 bottom, at latest follow-up,
there was no significant difference between ultrathin-strut DES and
conventional thin-strut DES for the risk of non-cardiac death (RR
1.10, 95% CI 0.88-1.38, P = 0.397). There was mild heterogeneity (I2
= 23.7%). The difference in non-cardiac deaths between the devices
was statistically significant in the early (<_1 year) period (RR 1.39, 95%
CI 1.03-1.88, P = 0.029, I2 = 0.0%), but not in the later (>1 year)
period (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.86-1.42, P = 0.441, I2 = 33.5%)
(Supplementary material online, Appendix Figures S37 and S38).
However, the RRs between stent types for all-cause death were not
significantly different before and after 1 year (Pinteraction = 0.195).

Subgroup and stent-type analyses
There were no significant interactions between stent type and any of
the subgroups tested on the risk of TLF at latest follow-up
(Supplementary material online, Appendix Table S6). Similarly, there
was no evidence that the type of ultrathin-strut DES or 2nd-generation thin-strut DES had a moderating effect on the risk of any of the
clinical outcome measures (Supplementary material online, Appendix
Table S7). There was no evidence that the delta strut thickness between the arms or the anti-proliferative drug-type on the stents had
a moderating effect on the risk of any of the clinical outcomes
(Supplementary material online, Tables S8 and S9). There was also no

.. evidence of a moderating effect of follow-up duration on any clinical
..
.. outcomes (Supplementary material online, Table S10).
..
..
.. Sensitivity analyses
..
.. The results of the random-effects meta-analyses were consistent
.. when assessed by fixed effect (Supplementary material online,
..
.. Appendix Figures S39-S49). Fewer trials reported outcomes as HRs;

Ultrathin strut vs. conventional thin strut

CD-TLR and CD-TVR occurred less frequently with ultrathin-strut
DES.
Outcomes with contemporary 2nd-generation thin-strut DES
(most of which have strut thicknesses between 80 and 100 lm) are
excellent and have not been improved upon by various iterative
designs including bioresorbable polymer-based DES,42 polymer-free
DES,43 or bioresorbable scaffolds.44 In contrast, ultrathin-strut stents
(strut thickness <_70 lm) have potential advantages in terms of deliverability, are less likely to disturb flow in side-branches, and may promote more rapid endothelialization. Bangalore and colleagues7
previously reported a meta-analysis of ultrathin-strut DES vs. conventional 2nd-generation thin-strut DES in 10 trials with 11 658 randomized patients, reporting lower 1-year rates of TLF and MI. However,
the benefits were modest (e.g. 16% reduction in TLF) and of borderline statistical significance.

The present study is distinct from the Bangalore meta-analysis in
several ways. Nearly twice as many patients were included in the present study (with six additional trials included) and with mean followup duration of 2.5 years rather than 1 year, affording a substantially
greater number of events for more study power. Furthermore, to
examine the time-relatedness between stent types, outcomes were
categorized as occurring before or after the 1st year from stent implantation. We also performed detailed analyses by subgroup and
stent type and have included other detailed sensitivity analyses that
had not been performed previously.
The present study has confirmed a modest 15% long-term RR reduction of TLF with ultrathin-strut DES compared with conventional
2nd-generation thin-strut DES, with consistent reductions in risk before and after 1 year following stent implantation. Although the
strength of evidence for the reduction in long-term TLF with

..

..
.. greater accuracy. Second, HRs are often considered the most appro..
.. priate method for analysing time-to-event data, but most trials did
.. not report their outcomes using this metric. The secondary analyses
..
.. using this methodology, while included for completeness, are thus of
.. limited utility. Instead, we assessed the primary outcome using RRs
..
.. from individual event counts provided by the trials. Such effect sizes
.. may be influenced by the follow-up time points. To address this (and
..
.. recognizing the typical differential in risk after stent implantation be.. yond 1 year), we provided analyses for early (<_1 year) and later (>1
..
.. year) events when reported, for which the P-values for interaction
..
.. were non-significant. However, we were not able to landmark events
.. at 1 year to specifically evaluate outcomes in the late period. To fur..
.. ther address variable follow-up duration, we assessed the impact of
.. follow-up duration on clinical outcomes as a regression analysis, with
..
.. no evidence of a significant moderating effect on any clinical out.. comes. We also performed additional sensitivity analysis including

ultrathin-strut DES (P = 0.008) is improved compared with the
Bangalore report,7 the 95% CI was still wide, consistent with a reduction in TLF ranging from 4% to 24%. The composite endpoint of TVF
at latest follow-up was also reduced by 15% with ultrathin-strut DES,
with similar magnitude of risk reductions before and after 1 year.
The reductions in TLF and TVF with ultrathin-strut DES were
driven by relative 25% and 16% reductions in CD-TLR and CDTVR, respectively, favouring ultrathin-strut DES both before and
after 1 year. In contrast, there were no significant differences between stent types in the risk of MI. These findings vary from those
from the prior meta-analysis by Bangalore and colleagues7 in which
the reduction in TLF between stent types was driven by a lower
risk of MI with no difference in repeat revascularization.
Mechanistically, thicker strut dimensions increase vascular injury,
flow separation, and stagnation, thereby modulating thrombogenicity and neointimal hyperplasia.45 Increasing strut thickness is also
associated with delayed or impaired endothelialization (in part
related to these flow disturbances45), which may also promote
increased neointimal formation.46 The independent impact of strut
thickness on angiographic neointimal hyperplasia and clinical restenosis after bare-metal stents was previously demonstrated in the
ISAR-STEREO trials.5,47 Despite the smaller amount of neointimal
hyperplasia and lower CD-TLR rates after 2nd-generation thinstrut DES compared with 1st-generation DES or bare-metal stents,
the present report confirms that further reducing strut thickness
to <70 lm has a favourable effect on freedom from repeat revascularization. As the present outcomes were consistent across subgroups, the absolute benefit of ultrathin-strut DES would be
expected to be greatest in patients (e.g. diabetics) and lesions (e.g.
small vessels, diffuse disease) at high risk for restenosis.
In the present study, there was no significant difference in the risk
of MI between stent types, either at latest follow-up or before or
after 1 year. This was true for TV-MI as well as any MI. However, the
point estimates favoured ultrathin-strut DES, and a small difference in
MI between stent types cannot be excluded. Similarly, the difference
in ST between stent types did not reach statistical significance, although given the point estimate again favouring ultrathin-strut DES
(RR 0.87), a small reduction in ST might have emerged had more
events accrued.
Thus, ultrathin-strut DES were associated with early and late
reductions in CD-TLR with numerically fewer MI and ST events.
Nonetheless, ultrathin-strut DES were associated with a non-significant 11% increase in the risk of all-cause mortality compared with
conventional 2nd-generation thin-strut DES, with minimal heterogeneity between trials. Given the numerically lower rates of ST, TVMI, any MI, and CD-TLR with ultrathin-strut DES (all of which have
been associated with reductions in subsequent mortality after stent
implantation),48-52 the mechanism(s) underlying a plausible increase
in all-cause death is uncertain, especially as the difference was driven
by greater non-cardiac mortality occurring within 1 year after implantation. Considering individual trials, all-cause death was significantly increased with the ultrathin-strut Orsiro stent in the
BIOSCIENCE trial at 5-year follow-up18 and with the ultrathin-strut
Supraflex stent in the TALENT trial at 1-year follow-up,28 but not at
2-year follow-up.40 In the BIOSCIENCE trial, the excess in all-cause
mortality was driven by greater non-cardiac deaths, specifically with
more patients dying from cancer in the Orsiro arm. The 1-year

Conclusions
In the present meta-analysis of 16 trials randomizing 20 701 patients
and with a mean follow-up of 2.5 years, ultrathin-strut DES were
associated with a modestly reduced long-term risk of TLF and TVF
compared with conventional 2nd-generation thin-strut DES, the differences driven by lower rates of CD-TLR and CD-TVR. There were
no significant differences in the risks of MI, ST, cardiac death, or allcause mortality.

Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/27/2643/6276781 by Stanford Libraries user on 28 April 2022

A variety of stent types were used in both the ultrathin group and
the control group, although the most common ultrathin-strut stent
was Orsiro and the most common control stent was Xience. We
tested for an effect of stent type within both the ultrathin-strut group
and the control group, and the statistical tests for interaction were
non-significant in both groups. The Orsiro stent has thicker struts for
larger stent diameters (>_3.5 mm). However, the median reference
vessel diameters or maximum implanted stent diameters did not exceed 3.5 mm in any of the included trials, and in the majority, the
mean reference vessel diameters were below 3.0 mm with standard
deviations of 0.4-0.5 mm. We therefore believe that the use of
3.5 mm Orsiro stents would have been in a small minority of patients,
likely under 10% of the total included patients. Individual patient data
could help to clarify this further.
Finally, to avoid bias from measured and unmeasured confounders,
our study was limited to randomized trials, which by their nature
included a selected cohort of patients, introducing concerns of generalizability. However, several of the individual studies were of an 'allcomers' design,18,19,28,30,33,34,38 and collectively, the 16 trials recruited
a broad cross-section of patients including those with acute coronary
syndrome and complex CAD.
