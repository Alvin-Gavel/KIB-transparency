Interpreting MI in ISCHEMIA

Relevant background
Decades of accumulated dogma have suggested not just an association, but a causal relationship, between epicardial obstructive coronary artery stenoses, myocardial ischaemia, and adverse outcomes-
including mortality and MI-thus leading to the prevalent belief that
reduction of ischaemia by revascularization improves clinical outcomes. However, since 2003, a number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs)2-4 and meta-analyses5 have failed to demonstrate an
interaction between ischaemia, revascularization, and mortality.
However, in those studies, the extent and severity of ischaemia was
not well characterized. ISCHEMIA was unique because it was the first
RCT of an invasive strategy with state-of-the-art revascularization
techniques plus optimal medical therapy (OMT) vs. OMT alone in
patients with moderate-to-severe ischaemia. It also addressed other
methodological weaknesses of prior studies, including randomization
before delineating coronary anatomy, a goal of revascularization of all
ischaemic areas (total ischaemic revascularization), and use of
second-generation drug-eluting stents.

Reduction of future myocardial
infarction by an invasive
strategy-biologically plausible?
Pathological observations over the past 40 years have consistently
demonstrated that culprit plaques responsible for most spon
taneous MIs share common histological characteristics,6 including

inflammation, a thin fibrous cap, positive remodelling, and a large necrotic core, often found together in the so-called thin-capped fibroatheromas. These adverse plaque characteristics are demonstrable
prospectively by advanced imaging techniques, including intravascular
ultrasound with virtual histology, optical coherence tomography, or
coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography. Even with
advanced techniques, however, these imaging-based plaque characteristics have remarkably poor positive predictive value for clinical
events. In the PROSPECT trial, 596 thin-cap fibroatheromas were
identified using intravascular ultrasound, but only 6 patients had an MI
within 3.4 years.7 In the SCOT-HEART trial, 1376 plaques with adverse characteristics were identified on CT, yet across the entire cohort only 41 patients had an MI after 4.7 years.8 Similarly, in the
PROMISE trial, 1019 coronary plaques with adverse characteristics
were observed on CT, yet only 24 subsequent non-fatal MIs
occurred.9 It strains credulity that less sophisticated angiographic selection of a lesion based simply on the degree of stenosis or physiologic lesion selection for PCI based on an inducible trans-stenotic
pressure gradient would outperform advanced imaging techniques,
identify plaques at the risk of rupture, and by intervening on them,
avert downstream MIs. More likely, stenosis reduction by PCI ameliorates the trans-stenotic gradient, thus preventing the development of
Type 2 MIs that are easily confused with Type 1 MIs based on clinical
and angiographic criteria. Conversely, CABG may prevent future
Type 1 MIs because bypass grafts to the mid-coronary arteries not
only treat culprit lesions (even anatomically complex ones) but also
provide prophylaxis against new proximal lesions, whereas stents
treat only identified stenotic segments with no effect on remote native coronary artery disease (CAD) progression.10

Problems in downplaying
periprocedural myocardial
infarction
An advancing narrative in the aftermath of ISCHEMIA is that, compared to 'spontaneous' MI, periprocedural MI events are inconsequential and prognostically unimportant. ISCHEMIA, for unknown
reasons, used a primary definition of periprocedural MI that required,
for PCI, an increase of creatine kinase (CK)-MB >5 times the upper
reference limit (URL) (preferred) or an increase in cardiac troponin
(cTn) >35 times the URL with either new electrocardiographic
changes or angiographic evidence of reduced flow or coronary dissection. In the absence of ancillary findings, CK-MB and cTn had to be
>10 times and >70 times the URL, respectively. For CABG-related
MI, definitions were even more stringent.1 Thus, the frequent patient
with 'only' an increase in troponin T (URL: 14 ng/mL)-say, from 6 to
910 ng/mL (= URL  65)-would not be classified as having suffered
an MI.
ISCHEMIA also considered alternative 'secondary' definitions of
MI, consistent with the Third Universal Definition of Myocardial
Infarction (UDMI)11: in patients with normal baseline cTn (as in most
patients with CCS), elevations of cTn >5 and >10 times the URL
occurring within 48 h of PCI or CABG, respectively-plus ancillary
findings-would be defined as a Type 4a or 5 MI, respectively-not
just 'myocardial injury'. These 'secondary' definitions, recently

or heart failure, or resuscitated cardiac arrest] and secondary endpoint (cardiovascular death and MI) did not differ between invasive
and conservative strategies, refuting the long-held belief in a prognostic benefit from revascularization by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery
among patients with CCS who had significant inducible myocardial ischaemia at baseline.1 In the invasive group of ISCHEMIA, 79% of
patients underwent revascularization (PCI in 74%; CABG in 26%),
whereas 21% did not. Periprocedural (Types 4a and 5) and late
procedure-related MIs (Types 4b and 4c) were more frequent in the
invasive arm, whereas late, spontaneous MIs were more common in
the conservative arm. Although periprocedural MI was not associated
with increased all-cause or cardiovascular mortality, late procedurerelated MI was associated with a nearly four- and seven-fold
increased risk in death and cardiovascular death, respectively. Type 1
MI was associated with a 2.4- and 3.3-fold increase in all-cause and
cardiovascular death. On this basis, some have concluded that early
revascularization should be offered to patients with CCS to prevent
'prognostically important' infarctions, i.e. spontaneous MIs while
ignoring periprocedural and late procedure-related MIs (Graphical abstract). This commentary seeks to provide a rebuttal to this speculative conclusion by considering both biological plausibility and
alternative evidence-based explanations, namely that (i) 'procedural'
MIs are not innocuous and (ii) the higher mortality associated with
revascularization-related (Types 4a, 4b, 4c, and 5) MI completely
counterbalances the alleged mortality reduction attributed to a lower
rate of Type 1 MI, resulting in net neutrality of total death rates.

2988

Prognostic implications of
myocardial infarctions in
ISCHEMIA
For an MI to be clinically and prognostically significant, its prevention
by revascularization should result in a mortality reduction. There has
been much commentary regarding the greater impact on late mortality for spontaneous compared with periprocedural MIs (with little
consideration of the excess mortality associated with late procedurerelated MIs), yet in ISCHEMIA there was absolutely no differential effect of treatment strategy on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality at
5 years1 (Graphical abstract). The only reasonable explanation for this
observation is that the carry-over effects on mortality of the excess
periprocedural (Types 4a and 5) and late procedure-related (Types
4b and 4c) MIs in the invasive arm (224 - 44 = 180) perfectly balanced
the carry-over effects of the 80 (186 - 106) excess spontaneous MIs
in the conservative arm. The finding that periprocedural MI according
either to primary or secondary definitions in ISCHEMIA would not
be associated with later mortality15 is counterintuitive based on the
above considerations, and likely the result of a type II statistical
error-claiming the absence of an effect because of the inability to
show it in statistical terms.

Implications of the myocardial
infarction narrative in ISCHEMIA
for routine cardiology practice
The findings of ISCHEMIA placed in appropriate context with prior
randomized trials demonstrate that patients with CCS with
moderate-to-severe ischaemia due to obstructive CAD in whom left
main CAD is excluded should be initiated on a robust medical regimen of anti-anginal therapies, disease-modifying therapies, risk factor
treatment and lifestyle interventions, including smoking cessation,

.. weight loss where indicated, and regular aerobic exercise. Since the
..
.. ISCHEMIA quality-of-life analysis showed a reduction in angina with
.. the invasive strategy, patients with persistent and unacceptable angina
..
.. should be referred for invasive angiography and considered for revas.. cularization. For patients with infrequent (i.e. monthly) angina, which
..
.. characterized 80% of ISCHEMIA patients, there would seem to be
.. a much less compelling justification for revascularization, and cardiol..
.. ogists should no longer refer patients for revascularization solely
..
... based on the results of ischaemia testing.
In summary, interpretations of presumed revascularization bene..
.. fit predicated on a reduction in spontaneous MI in ISCHEMIA that
..
.. dismiss the consequences of periprocedural and late procedure.. related MI may lead to fallacious conclusions that are neither bal..
.. anced nor fact-based. Thus, caution and circumspection should
.. guide both discussions with patients with CCS and any decision..
.. making about the risks and benefits of revascularization, while
.. emphasizing that OMT remains the preferred initial approach to
..
.. management.

reiterated in the 4th UDMI12 based on expert consensus in the absence of definitive trial-based data, have now been corroborated by a
recent analysis from the SYNTAX trial13 and a meta-analysis of all
PCI trials reporting on cardiac biomarkers in patients with CCS,14
both concluding that such post-procedural troponin elevations are
indeed associated with mortality. When the UDMI-consistent secondary ISCHEMIA definition is adopted, Type 4a MIs in the invasive
arm in ISCHEMIA would more than triple, from 26 to 98.1 Using the
secondary MI definition, there would be overall 106 Type 1 and Type
2 spontaneous MIs in the invasive arm and 186 in the conservative
arm, but this would be counterbalanced by far many more periprocedural (Types 4a and 5) and late procedure-related (Types 4b and 4c)
MIs in the invasive arm (224 vs. 44): in aggregate, 330 MIs in the invasive strategy vs. 230 MIs in the conservative strategy1 (Graphical abstract). The occurrence of some procedural MIs in the conservative
arm was due to some cross-over from the conservative to the invasive
arm during the course of the trial. In any case, in reality, according to
current UDMI definitions, more MIs with adverse downstream effects
on mortality occurred in the invasive than in the conservative arm.
