This commentary refers to 'Predicted benefit of an
implantable cardioverter-defibrillator: the MADIT-ICD
benefit score' by A. Younis et al., https://doi.org/10.1093/
eurheartj/ehaa1057 and the discussion piece 'Prediction of
sudden arrhythmic death in patients with heart failure: towards validation in a worldwide broader range of patients'
by R. Fukuoka et al., https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/
ehab159.
We agree with the comment made by Drs. Fukuoka, Kawamura,
and Kohsaka that our MADIT-ICD benefit score1 was developed and
validated within the strict inclusion/exclusion criteria of landmark
randomized clinical trials (RCTs), and therefore there is a need for
further assessment and validation within more heterogenous realworld populations. Fukuoka et al.2 mention three specific possible
disparities (lack of inclusion of Asian populations, the applicability of
the score to patients with multiple comorbidities, and to those without advanced left ventricular dysfunction) that we would like to address herein.
Patients enrolled in the multi-national Acute Decompensated
Heart Failure Registry (ADHERE) International-Asia Pacific study
of hospitalized heart failure (HF) were shown to be significantly
younger compared with patients enrolled in the parallel US-based
ADHERE registry (median age 67 vs. 75 years),3 but also displayed
more advanced comorbidities and higher rates of complications
and death.4 Lam et al.5 prospectively studied 5276 patients with
stable HF and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF
<_40%) from 11 Asian regions and showed significant heterogeneity among Asian patients with stable HF. The MADIT-ICD benefit
score was developed in 4503 patients, of whom 1102 (24%) were
enrolled in >40 non-US sites (mostly in Europe). Thus, the findings
regarding major differences in the clinical characteristics and
outcomes of HF patients enrolled in Asian-Pacific Registries
stress the need for the assessment of the score in non-Western
cohorts and especially among Asian HF patients. Nevertheless, it

..
.. should be noted that our score comprises variables that address
.. the different characteristics of patients enrolled in Asian-Pacific
..
.. Registries, including age, aetiology of underlying cardiomyopathy,
.. and associated comorbidities. We therefore expect a consistent
..
.. performance of the score in Asian populations.
..
Fukuoka et al. also stress the importance of score validation in
..
.. real-world setting among patients with more advanced comorbidities
.. compared with those enrolled in RCTs. Although we fully agree
..
.. with this point, it should be noted again that comorbidities are an
.. important component of our Non-Arrhythmic Mortality Score.
..
.. Thus, patients with advanced comorbidities who are usually excluded
.. from RCTs are expected to derive a lower benefit from the ICD due
..
.. to a higher non-arrhythmic vs. arrhythmic mortality based on the
..
.. MADIT-ICD benefit score.
..
Lastly, we also agree on the importance of developing appropriate
..
.. risk stratification algorithm for sudden cardiac death in patients
.. without advanced LV dysfunction. However, we would like to stress
..
.. that the primary aim of this study was to improve risk stratification
.. for primary ICD implantation among patients with LVEF <_35% who
..
.. are indicated for the device based on current guidelines since the
.. benefit of the ICD in this population is not uniform.
..
..
We would like to thank Fukuoka et al. for their support of im.. plementation of our score in a broader range of populations. We
..
.. believe that this would be an important step towards precision
.. management that will facilitate appropriate selection for primary
..
.. ICD implantation.

A 64-year-old woman with a history of
hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, severe calcific mitral stenosis, and
suprasystemic World Health Organ
ization group 2 pulmonary hypertension presented with New York Heart
Association class IV exertional dyspnoea, presyncope, chest tightness, and
recurrent hospitalizations for diastolic
heart failure in the past 8 months.
Transthoracic echocardiography reve
aled asymmetric septal hypertrophy
and calcific mitral stenosis (Supplementary material online, Video S1). Left
ventricular systolic function was hyperdynamic (left ventricular ejection fraction of 80%) with systolic mid-cavitary
obliteration. Mitral valve systolic anterior motion was attenuated due to
valvular calcification, with dynamic
obstruction resulting from tubular outflow tract narrowing (Supplementary
material online, Video S1). Continuous
wave Doppler demonstrated narrow,
late peaking gradients of 48 mmHg at
rest (Panel C) and 66 mmHg with Valsalva (Panel D), corresponding to combined mid-cavitary and outflow tract obstruction. M-mode of the
aortic valve revealed premature systolic partial closure secondary to dynamic obstruction (Panel A).
Despite elevated operative risk in the setting of her comorbidities, she successfully underwent extended septal myectomy and mitral
valve replacement. Echocardiography 8 days postoperatively demonstrated relief of obstruction (Supplementary material online, Video S2),
with a more rounded Doppler envelope (gradient 16 mmHg, Panel E). Abolishment of aortic valve premature closure was demonstrated
on reformatted M-mode imaging (Panel B).
The high temporal resolution of M-mode provides unique clinical information. In this patient with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,
premature systolic partial closure due to dynamic outflow obstruction presented as a 'heart within a heart' pattern, which resolved
post-myectomy.
