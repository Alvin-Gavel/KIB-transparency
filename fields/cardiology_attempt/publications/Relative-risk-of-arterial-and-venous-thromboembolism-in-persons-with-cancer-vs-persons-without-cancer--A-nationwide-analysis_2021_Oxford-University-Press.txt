Aims

An interrelation between cancer and thrombosis is known, but population-based studies on the risk of both arterial
thromboembolism (ATE) and venous thromboembolism (VTE) have not been performed.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
International Classification of Disease 10th Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis codes of all publicly insured persons in
and results
Austria (0-90 years) were extracted from the Austrian Association of Social Security Providers dataset covering

the years 2006-07 (n = 8 306 244). Patients with a history of cancer or active cancer were defined as having at
least one ICD-10 'C' diagnosis code, and patients with ATE and/or VTE as having at least one of I21/I24 (myocardial infarction), I63/I64 (stroke), I74 (arterial embolism), and I26/I80/I82 (venous thromboembolism) diagnosis code.
Among 158 675 people with cancer, 8559 (5.4%) had an ATE diagnosis code and 7244 (4.6%) a VTE diagnosis
code. In contrast, among 8 147 569 people without cancer, 69 381 (0.9%) had an ATE diagnosis code and 29 307
(0.4%) a VTE diagnosis code. This corresponds to age-stratified random-effects relative risks (RR) of 6.88 [95%
confidence interval (CI) 4.81-9.84] for ATE and 14.91 (95% CI 8.90-24.95) for VTE. ATE proportion was highest
in patients with urinary tract malignancies (RR: 7.16 [6.74-7.61]) and lowest in patients with endocrine cancer (RR:
2.49 [2.00-3.10]). The corresponding VTE proportion was highest in cancer of the mesothelium/soft tissue (RR:
19.35 [17.44-21.47]) and lowest in oropharyngeal cancer (RR: 6.62 [5.61-7.81]).

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
The RR of both ATE and VTE are significantly higher in persons with cancer. Our population-level meta-data indi-

cate a strong association between cancer, ATE and VTE, and support the concept of shared risk factors and pathobiology between these diseases.

Introduction
Thrombosis is a leading contributor to global disease burden, and
one out of four deaths worldwide are caused by thrombosis.1 Prior
studies suggested an interrelation between cancer and both arterial
thromboembolism (ATE) and venous thromboembolism (VTE).2-7
According to recent data from the Vienna Cancer and Thrombosis
Study, the 2-year cumulative incidences of ATE and VTE are 2.6%
and 8.7% in patients with cancer, respectively.7,8 In comparison to the
general population, a two-fold increased risk of ATE and a four- to
seven-fold higher risk of VTE has been reported in patients with cancer in previous studies.4-6,9,10 Furthermore, prior studies have indicated that the occurrence of ATE/VTE varies by cancer type and is
associated with poor prognosis.4-7,11,12 However, large-scale population-based data informing on both the risk of ATE and VTE in the
overall cancer population and scrutinizing the risk according to single
cancer types are currently not available.
With vascular diseases and cancer becoming more prevalent in an
aging population, the proportion of cancer-associated ATE/VTE is
likely to increase in the future.13-15 The emergence of novel antineoplastic therapy approaches (e.g. vascular endothelial growth factor
targeted, immunotherapeutic) might further contribute to an increasing risk of cancer-associated ATE/VTE.4,16-19 Since data on long-term
effects of cancer therapy are scarce, it is difficult to determine the
exact incidence of cardiovascular complications. Furthermore, this
lack of data could also result in inadequate thromboprophylaxis or
unnecessary interruption of cancer therapy.20 Therefore, it is of

Multiple cancer diagnoses were possible when data were broken down into separate cancer types.

ICD-10 diagnosis code starting with the letter 'C'. Cancer types were
classified according to the ICD-10 classification system: 'C00-C14'-malignant neoplasms of lip, oral cavity and pharynx; 'C15-C26'-malignant
neoplasms of digestive organs; 'C30-C39'-malignant neoplasms of respiratory and intrathoracic organs; 'C40-C41'-malignant neoplasms of
bone
and
articular
cartilage;
'C43-C44'-melanoma and other malignant neoplasms of skin; 'C45-
C49'-malignant neoplasms of mesothelial and soft tissue; 'C50'-malignant neoplasm of breast; 'C51-C58'-malignant neoplasms of female
genital organs; 'C60-C63'-malignant neoplasms of male genital organs;
'C64-C68'-malignant neoplasms of urinary tract; 'C69-C72'-malignant neoplasms of eye, brain and other parts of central nervous system;
'C73-C75'-malignant neoplasms of thyroid and other endocrine glands;
'C76-C80'-malignant neoplasms of ill-defined, secondary and unspecified sites; and 'C81-C96'-malignant neoplasms, stated or presumed to
be primary, of lymphoid, haematopoietic, and related tissue.
Patients with ATE were defined as having at least one of the following
ICD-10 diagnosis codes: (1) 'I21'-acute myocardial infarction, (2) 'I24'-
other acute ischaemic heart diseases, (3) 'I63'-cerebral infarction, (4)
'I64'-stroke, not specified as haemorrhage or infarction, and (5) 'I74'-
arterial embolism and thrombosis, respectively. Patients with VTE were
defined as having at least one of the following ICD-10 diagnosis code: (1)
'I26'-pulmonary embolism, (2) 'I80'-thrombosis, phlebitis, and
thrombophlebitis, and (3) 'I82'-other venous thromboembolism, and
thrombosis.
Specific approval from the local ethics committee was not required for
conducting the analysis.

Statistical analysis
Continuous variables were summarized as median [25th-75th percentile], and count data as absolute frequency (%). The proportion of subjects
with cancer, ATE and VTE diagnosis code was summarized using a

..
.. random-effects (RE) model for proportions with exact 95% confidence
.. intervals (CI) (Stata routine metaprop). To stabilize the variance of the
.. proportions in these analyses, a Freeman-Tukey double arcsine trans..
.. formation was performed.22 The RR of an ATE or VTE diagnosis code be.. tween patients with and without cancer was estimated with an RE model
..
.. for RR (Stata routine metan). Throughout, proportions and RR were esti.. mated/stratified by age groups. In all analyses, the I2-statistic was used to
.. quantify heterogeneity, with I2 values >0.30 considered indicative of het..
.. erogeneity. Stata 15.0 (Stata Corp., Houston, TX, USA) and SPSS 25
.. (SPSS Inc, Chicago IL, USA) were used to perform all statistical analyses.

in subjects with and without a cancer diagnosis code. The risk of
having an arterial thromboembolism diagnosis code was 7 times
higher in patients with a concurrent cancer diagnosis code than in
subjects without a cancer diagnosis code. The relative risk of arterial
thromboembolism declined with increasing age, due to the increase
in arterial thromboembolism proportion with age in subjects without a cancer diagnosis code. The overall pooled risk ratio was estimated with a random-effects model. Individual estimates per age
category are depicted as diamonds with 95% confidence intervals as
bars. Grey boxes surrounding the diamonds are proportional to the
weight of the individual age strata within the overall pooled risk
ratio.

The proportions of ATE in the total study population, in women,
and men were 0.94% (95% CI 0.93-0.94), 0.87% (0.86-0.87), and
1.01% (1.01-1.02), respectively, and increased with age (Supplementary material online, Figure S2 and Supplementary material online,
Table S2).
The proportion of VTE in the total study population, in women,
and men was 0.44% (95% CI 0.44-0.44), 0.50% (0.49-0.51), and
0.38% (0.37-0.38), respectively. As expected, the proportion of VTE
increased with higher age, ranging from 0.01% (0.01-0.01) in subjects
<_12 years to 2.78% (2.73-2.83) in subjects aged 80-90
(Supplementary material online, Figure S3 and Supplementary material online, Table S2).

thromboembolism in persons with vs.
without a cancer diagnosis code
Among 158 675 patients with a cancer diagnosis code, 8559 also had
a documented ATE diagnosis (RE-RR: 0.05 [95% CI 0.05-0.06]). The
corresponding RR for females and males were 0.04 (0.04-0.05) and
0.06 (0.06-0.06), respectively. In comparison, among 8.147 569 persons without a documented cancer diagnosis, 69 381 also had a documented ATE diagnosis (RE proportion: 0.01 [95% CI 0.01-0.01]).
The RE proportion for females and males was 0.01 (0.01-0.01) each.

Supplementary material online, Table S4).
A cancer diagnosis code was present in 7244 of the 36 551 patients
with a VTE diagnosis code. Therefore, the proportion of patients
with cancer in the group of all patients with VTE was 19.82%
(19.41-20.23) (Figure 5 and Supplementary material online, Table S3).
The corresponding proportions for women and men were 18.10%
(17.58-18.62) and 22.22% (21.56-22.88) (Supplementary material
online, Figure S8 and Supplementary material online, Table S3). Within
the group of patients with VTE, unspecified cancer was the most
common cancer type (7.62%; 7.35-7.90) and bone/cartilage cancer
was the least common cancer type (0.15%; 0.11-0.19) (Figure 6 and

Supplementary material online, Figure S9 and Supplementary material online, Table S4 provide gender-segregated data regarding the
proportion of patients with certain cancer types and an ATE or VTE
diagnosis code.

Discussion
In this nationwide analysis, we utilized medical claims data to quantify
the association between cancer and a history of concurrent ATE or
VTE diagnosis. Persons with a cancer diagnosis code were seven
times more likely to have an ATE diagnosis code and 15 times more
likely to have a VTE diagnosis code compared to persons without a
diagnosis of cancer (Graphical Abstract). The RR of both ATE and VTE
varied by cancer type. ATE proportion was highest in patients with

of having a venous thromboembolism diagnosis code was 15 times

thromboembolism declined with increasing age, due to the increase
in venous thromboembolism proportion with age in subjects without a cancer diagnosis code. The overall pooled risk ratio was estimated with a random-effects model. Individual estimates per age

cancer of the urinary tract, while VTE proportion was highest in
patients with cancer of the mesothelium/soft tissue.
We followed two different approaches to clarify the link between
cancer and ATE or VTE, respectively. First, we analysed the RR of
both ATE and VTE in subjects with a diagnosis code for cancer and
found a higher proportion compared to people who did not have a
cancer diagnosis. Second, we investigated the proportion of subjects
with a cancer code in all people with a diagnosis of ATE or VTE. Of
note, 11% with an ATE and 20% with a VTE also had a cancer diagnosis code. Although similar numbers have been repeatedly reported in
previous publications and reviews, the evidence from large
population-based studies was scarce.6,7,23,24 Here, we provide epidemiological data, which specifically support the assumption that one
in five VTE cases are related to cancer.

These population-level meta-data support the concept of a close
interrelation between cancer and both ATE and VTE. While the
increased risk of VTE in patients with cancer is well documented,
data on the risk of ATE are scarce. Recently, Navi et al.25 showed that
patients with cancer have a six times higher risk of ATE in the first
30 days after a cancer diagnosis than age, sex, race, and education
matched controls. The risk of VTE in patients with cancer has been
reported to be 4 to 7 times higher than in persons without cancer,
based on older studies.26,27 Interestingly, in our study cohort, the RR
of VTE was 15 times higher in patients with cancer compared to subjects without cancer. The higher RR could be explained by the fact
that our analysis is based on proportion data and not incidence data
and it is very likely that some patients developed VTE before the diagnosis of cancer.28

Despite the relatively high prevalence of cancer and thrombosis in
the general population, the magnitude of their association has not
been reflected in previous studies. Moreover, the majority of recent
interventional studies investigating antithrombotic therapy for ATE or
VTE have excluded patients with active cancer.29-31 For instance, in

antagonists for treatment of acute VTE, the proportion of patients
with cancer varies between 2% and 9%, which is much lower than the
proportion of patients with VTE and cancer in our present study.32-35
Interestingly, the RIETE registry, where patients with acute VTE are
enrolled and prospectively followed, supports our result that 20% of
all venous thromboembolic events are related to cancer.36 Active

In conclusion, the RR of ATE and VTE was substantially higher in
..
.. all age groups in persons with cancer, whereby the concept of shared
..
.. risk factors and pathobiology between these diseases is supported.
.. Our population-level meta-data not only describe the burden of VTE
..
.. in patients with cancer but also support the concept that a diagnosis
.. of cancer is associated with ATE. Further research is needed to bet..
.. ter understand the epidemiology of cancer-associated thrombosis
.. and to gain more knowledge on long-term complications of anti..
.. cancer therapies. Finally, it is necessary to increase the awareness of
.. medical professionals about cancer-associated ATE and VTE, as it is
..
.. becoming more prevalent in an aging population.

cancer is generally an exclusion criterion for an interventional trial
investigating treatments for ATE; therefore, no controlled data exist
on the treatment of cancer patients with ATE. Recent cohort studies
have demonstrated that the risk of a cancer diagnosis is increased after
an arterial event.37,38
Some limitations due to the cross-sectional design of the study
have to be acknowledged. In contrast to previous studies, which
reported incidence, we were only able to estimate RR, which limits
direct comparisons.2-7 Due to the nature of our medical claims database, which did not provide the exact dates of diagnosis, we could
not identify the temporal connection between the occurrence of
cancer and ATE or VTE. This directly extends to the next major limitation, namely our inability to meaningfully include anticoagulant,
antithrombotic, and antineoplastic therapy prescriptions into our
analysis. A careful analysis of these treatments may have allowed for a
more refined estimation of the association between malignancy and
thrombosis.
Another important limitation due to the study design is the impossibility to assess the temporal relationship between cancer and
thrombosis or to identify the underlying cause of thromboembolism.
Furthermore, by using medical claims data, our study has the possibility of incorrect or missed diagnoses.
Nevertheless, our study provides a cross-sectional analysis of the
total population and the results are supported by previous studies.6,7
Whether interrelation between cancer and ATE/VTE is mainly
causally related or confounded by common risk factors is still not entirely understood. Smoking, for example a strong risk factor for both
lies on the causal pathway for ATE and most cancer types and might
potentially confound the association between cancer and ATE.39
However, the RR of ATE and VTE was highest in younger patients
with a cancer diagnosis. This might suggest a direct effect of cancer
and/or its treatments (e.g. chemotherapy and radiation) on risk of
ATE and VTE. Because the proportion of thrombosis is very low in
the general population at a younger age, a higher RR is observed in
patients with cancer at a younger age, and the RR decreases with
increasing age.40 Furthermore, these patients might be survivors of
childhood cancer and we know from prior studies that childhood
cancer survivors are at an increased risk of cardiovascular disease
compared with age-matched peers, due to long-term effects of cancer therapy.41 Since improved anti-cancer treatments prolong survival of patients with cancer, long-term effects of cancer therapies are
becoming more relevant for adults as well. As the number of patients
with a history of cancer is expected to further increase, these patients
need special follow-up, which has led to the establishment of cardiooncology clinics. This medical sub-specialty is dedicated to clinical
care and research in patients with cancer and cardiovascular diseases.42 The 2016 position paper by Zamorano et al.20 state that the
implementation of cardio-oncology teams and regular screening for
cardiovascular disease in cancer survivors are useful measures to improve the cardiovascular outcome of cancer patients. In addition to
higher morbidity, previous studies have shown that the occurrence
of ATE/VTE in patients with cancer increases mortality.6,7,43
Therefore, it is necessary to further investigate the coincidence of
cancer and thrombosis to improve the clinical management of
patients with cancer and ATE/VTE. This applies in particular when
