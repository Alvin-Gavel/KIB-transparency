of direct oral anticoagulants', by P.V Rasmussen and E. Hylek, https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab524.

Aims

Persistence with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) has become a concern in non-valvular atrial fibrillation
(NVAF) patients, but whether this affects prognosis is rarely studied. We investigated the persistence with oral
anticoagulants (OACs) and its association with prognosis among a nationwide cohort of NVAF patients.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
DOAC-naive NVAF patients who started to use DOACs for ischaemic stroke prevention between 2013 and 2018
were included using Dutch national statistics. Persistence with OACs was determined based on the presence of a
and results

100-day gap between the last prescription and the end of study period. In 93 048 patients, 75.7% had a baseline
CHA2DS2-VASc score of >_2. The cumulative incidence of persistence with OACs was 88.1% [95% confidence
interval (CI) 87.9-88.3%], 82.6% (95% CI 82.3-82.9%), 77.7% (95% CI 77.3-78.1%), and 72.0% (95% CI
71.5-72.5%) at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years after receiving DOACs, respectively. Baseline characteristics associated with
better persistence with OACs included female sex, age range 65-74 years, permanent atrial fibrillation, previous
exposure to vitamin K antagonists, stroke history (including transient ischaemic attack), and a CHA2DS2-VASc
score >_2. Non-persistence with OACs was associated with an increased risk of the composite outcome of ischaemic stroke and ischaemic stroke-related death [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.79, 95% CI 1.49-2.15] and ischaemic
stroke (aHR 1.58, 95% CI 1.29-1.93) compared with being persistent with OACs.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
At least a quarter of NVAF patients were non-persistent with OACs within 4 years, which was associated with

poor efficacy of ischaemic stroke prevention. The identified baseline characteristics may help identify patients at
risk of non-persistence.

Predictors, time course, and outcomes of
persistence patterns in oral anticoagulation for
non-valvular atrial fibrillation: a Dutch
Nationwide Cohort Study

Persistence with oral anticoagulants in NVAF

4127

Graphical Abstract

Introduction
Non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF), the most common cardiac arrhythmia globally,1,2 is associated with a five-fold increased risk of ischaemic stroke.3,4 Long-term oral anticoagulation is therefore
recommended for NVAF patients at moderate to high risk of
thromboembolic events to prevent thromboembolism according to
current guidelines.5-7 Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) were the most
frequently used oral anticoagulants (OACs) over the past 60 years,
but direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are replacing VKAs to be the
main therapeutic option in NVAF.8,9 Compared with VKAs, DOACs
have attractive characteristics including predictable pharmacokinetics
and pharmacodynamics, low drug-drug and food interactions, and no
need for laboratory monitoring in general.10 Evidence from large
randomized controlled trials indicates at least noninferiority for the
combined endpoint of stroke or systemic embolism but a superior
safety profile of DOACs compared with VKAs.11-14 However, concerns have been expressed about treatment persistence (i.e., the duration of time from initiation to discontinuation of therapy15) with
DOACs. Since 'drugs don't work in patients who don't take them',16
the lack of regular control visits may be a double-edged sword.
Suboptimal persistence with DOACs in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients
was observed in numerous real-world studies, although a precise

.. estimation is challenging (and maybe not necessary) to obtain given
..
.. the variations of settings and definitions of non-persistence across
.. studies.17-24 Unlike the persistence pattern, the impact of non..
.. persistence with OACs on prognosis has not been well investigated.
.. As far as we know, only one study looked at the association between
..
.. DOAC persistence (instead of adherence) and clinical outcomes.21
..
.. For these reasons, we conducted a nationwide study to investigate
.. OAC persistence pattern and its association with prognosis among a
..
.. nationwide cohort of NVAF patients who initiated a DOAC between
.. 2013 and 2018 in the Netherlands.

Baseline characteristics

Persistence pattern
Non-persistence with OAC (i.e. stop receiving DOAC or VKA therapy)
and non-persistence with the initial DOAC (i.e. stop receiving DOAC
therapy, with/without switch from DOAC to VKA) were identified in the
study (illustrated in Supplementary material online, Figures S1 and S2).
Since data about the amount of medication for each prescription were
unavailable, a conservative definition was used to determine nonpersistence. In brief, to determine non-persistence with OAC, OAC
prescription records between the index date and December 31, 2018, or
date of death (whichever came first) were examined to identify the last
OAC prescription during this period. If the last OAC was prescribed
between October 1, 2018, and December 31, 2018 (i.e. an interval of
about 100 days), the patient would be considered as persistent with
OAC between the index date and September 30, 2018. If the last OAC
was prescribed before September 30, 2018, the patient would be considered as non-persistent with OAC from the date when the last OAC was
prescribed, unless the patient died within 100 days after the last OAC
prescription. We chose 100 days as the length of gap based on the fact
that a patient could only receive medication for a maximum of 90 days
each time in the Netherlands27 and extra 10 days were added to allow
some flexibility. Non-persistence with the initial DOAC was determined
in a similar way, but instead of the last OAC prescription, the last DOAC
prescription (before the first VKA prescription, if it existed) was used to
determine the persistence pattern to the initial DOAC. Since information
on specific types of DOAC was unavailable, the initial DOAC referred to
all types of DOACs rather than VKA.

Clinical outcomes
The following clinical outcomes were studied: (i) a composite outcome
of ischaemic stroke and ischaemic stroke-related death; (ii) ischaemic
stroke; and (iii) all-cause mortality. To determine the studied clinical outcomes, all patients were followed from the index date until the first occurrence of the studied outcome, date of death, or the end of the study

.. period (i.e. September 30, 2018), whichever came first. For the compos..
.. ite outcome, ischaemic stroke was examined in the diagnoses data, and at
.. the same time, death caused by ischaemic stroke was also examined in
..
.. the data about causes of death. For the outcome ischaemic stroke, only
.. diagnoses data were examined for ischaemic stroke. TIA was not
..
.. included when identifying ischaemic stroke.
..
..
.. Statistical analysis
.. Continuous variables were presented as means +/- standard deviations
.. and categorical variables were presented as numbers and percentages.
..
.. Kaplan-Meier estimator was used to estimate the cumulative incidences
.. of persistence with OAC (or persistence with the initial DOAC). To ex..
.. plore predictors of non-persistence with OAC (or non-persistence with
.. the initial DOAC), a Cox proportional hazard model was employed. In
..
.. addition to the crude association of each predictor with non-persistence,
.. the association after adjusting for age and sex was evaluated, with or with.. out restricting the follow-up time to up to 1 year and patients with a base..
.. line CHA2DS2-VASc score >_2. For variables extracted from the DHM
.. surveys, only DHM participants were included in the analyses. To evalu..
.. ate the associations between persistence pattern (i.e. persistence pattern
.. with OAC) and clinical outcomes, incidence rates of the studied out.. comes between persistent stage and non-persistent stage were calculated
..
.. and the Mantel-Byar method was used to estimate the associations. In
.. brief, persistence status was treated as a time-dependent exposure in
..
.. multivariable Cox regression models, and for non-persistent patients, the
.. follow-up time before becoming non-persistent was classified into the ef..
.. fect of being persistent instead of being non-persistent. The following ad.. justment models were used: (i) adjusting for age and sex and (ii) adjusting
.. for age, sex, subtype of AF, previous exposure to VKA, stroke history
..
.. (including TIA), and standardized household income. The associations
.. were also evaluated after being stratified by CHA2DS2-VASc score at
..
.. baseline. To examine the robustness of the associations, a sensitivity ana.. lysis was planned which first used different lengths of the gap to define
..
.. non-persistence with OAC (i.e. 14, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180 days) and then
.. evaluated again the associations between non-persistence with OAC and
.. the studied outcomes. As an examination of data quality, we examined
..
.. the associations between the baseline characteristics and the studied out.. comes. We also investigated time distributions of the studied outcomes
..
.. during the non-persistent stage with OAC using the cumulative incidence
.. competing risk method (for the composite outcome and ischaemic
.. stroke) and Kaplan-Meier estimator (for all-cause mortality). All statistic..
.. al analyses were performed with SPSSV Statistics (IBM Corp. Released
.. 2017; IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 25.0. Armonk, NY) and

The date of the first DOAC prescription was defined as the index date,
which was the baseline of the patients. The following baseline characteristics were studied: sex, age, subtype of AF (i.e. permanent or not; only
available for AF diagnosed after 2015 and the diagnosis that was closest
to the index date was used if a patient had more than one AF diagnosis
records), previous exposure to VKA (i.e. VKA prescribed before the
index date but after the first AF diagnosis), stroke history [including transient ischaemic attack (TIA)] and some other comorbidities (identified by
screening diagnosis data within 3 years before the index date), immigration status, marital status, standardized household income, the baseline
CHA2DS2-VASc score,25 and the adapted (8-item, removing the item
'Labile INR') HAS-BLED score.26 Detailed information about how the
two scores were calculated is presented in the Supplementary material
online, methods.
In addition to the above characteristics, for patients who had participated in the 'Dutch Health Monitor' (DHM) surveys before the index
date (i.e. DHM participants), the following characteristics were also
studied: highest education level, body mass index (BMI), physical health,
feeling of loneliness, feeling of depression, ability to meet financial needs,
alcohol use, smoking history, living alone, and employment status. If a patient participated in the surveys more than once before the index date,
data from the latest survey were used.

other baseline characteristics is presented in Table 1 and
Supplementary material online, Table S2. A total of 10 188 patients
had participated in at least one of the DHM surveys, which comprised
the DHM participants. Similar baseline characteristics (for variables
available for the entire cohort) were observed among the DHM participants compared with the entire cohort, except that the DHM participants were slightly older (mean age 74.8 +/- 9.3 years). According to
variables only available for the DHM participants, 43.6% had the highest education level of 'High school underclassman', 44.0% had a BMI
that ranged between 25 and 30 kg/m2, and 92.7% had a fair or good

Sensitivity analysis
The associations of non-persistence with OAC with the studied clinical
outcomes were robust after changing the length of the gap (i.e. from
100 to 14, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180 days) to define non-persistence with
OAC (Figure 2). The shorter the length of the gap to define nonpersistence with OAC, the higher HRs could be observed for the
associations of non-persistence with OAC with the studied clinical
outcomes. When using the longest length of the gap (i.e. 180 days) to
define non-persistence with OAC, non-persistence with OAC was still
associated with worse prognosis. As presented in Supplementary material online, Table S8, a younger age, male sex, paroxysmal AF, previous
exposure to VKA, absence from stroke history (including TIA), the
fifth quintile of standardized household income, a lower baseline
CHA2DS2-VASc score, and a lower baseline adapted HAS-BLED score
were associated with reduced risk of the studied clinical outcomes.

stage, showing that the studied clinical outcomes occurred more
frequently at the early stage after a patient became non-persistent
with OAC than the later stage. This could also be observed from the
cumulative incidences of the studied outcomes at different stages
after a patient became non-persistent with OAC (Supplementary
material online, Table S9).

Discussion
This study investigated a nationwide cohort of adult DOAC-naive
NVAF patients who started to use DOAC for ischaemic stroke prevention between 2013 and 2018 in the Netherlands. In the study
population, persistence pattern of OAC was assessed, together with
its potential associated risk factors and potential impact on clinical
outcomes. The main findings were: (i) the persistence with OAC or
with the initial DOAC was suboptimal, and a higher risk of nonpersistence was observed in the early stage after the start of DOAC
use compared to the later stage; (ii) several baseline characteristics
including baseline CHA2DS2-VASc score were associated with
persistence pattern; and (iii) being non-persistent with OAC was

associated with poor efficacy of ischaemic stroke prevention
(Graphical abstract).
There are several studies that investigated the persistence pattern
among AF patients who were receiving DOAC in real-world settings.
A recent meta-analysis24 reported an overall pooled proportion of
persistence with DOAC of 71% (95% CI 69-74%) at 6 months and
62% (95% CI 56-68%) at 1 year. Our study found a higher proportion
of persistence with DOAC (86.7% and 82.6% at 6 months and 1 year,
respectively), which can be attributed to the conservative criterion
we used to define non-persistence. In our study, we defined nonpersistence based on a 100-day gap applied after the last OAC (or
the initial DOAC) prescription. Although there are several methods
for defining persistence in pharmacoepidemiology,28 a definition
based on a gap is often used in anticoagulant studies. However, the

lengths of gap applied vary between studies, ranging from 14 to
90 days,18,19,21,29 and usually longer gaps result in reporting higher
persistence, which could also be observed in the sensitivity analysis of
our study. Theoretically, a gap should be determined according to
the pharmacologic properties of the medication and the treatment
situation,15 but such data are usually unavailable, especially for
population-based databases like ours. Therefore, we chose a conservative definition with the belief that an underestimated proportion of
non-persistence might be more informative than an overestimated
one (limiting the issue of a statistical type I finding), and as a result,
better persistence was observed in our study than in others. In addition to non-persistence with DOAC, our study also investigated
non-persistence with OAC (either DOAC or VKA) and a suboptimal
persistence with OAC was observed. Although the result is not

likely not to adhere with DOAC.41 However, a low income as a risk
factor for being non-persistent is unlikely to be related with pure financial distress as in the Netherlands DOACs are reimbursed by insurance companies for which every Dutch citizen must be a member.
It can however not be completely ruled out that financial distress is a
reason for not being persistent with DOAC in those with a low
household income as medication is on a 385e deductible. We cannot
further comment on this issue due to the design, since our study can
only look at predicting variables for persistence with OAC (or the initial DOAC). It is worth mentioning that our exploration of potential
predictors of persistence pattern is only an initial investigation, which
was mainly based on univariable regression analysis. Future studies
may further develop a prediction model incorporating many baseline
characteristics we identified to predict the persistence pattern.
The suboptimal persistence we observed would matter only when
it impacts prognosis. It has been confirmed in other classes of longterm used medications42,43 that poor medication-taking behaviours
in real-world settings cannot guarantee the same efficacy of that
observed in randomized controlled trials. This could intuitively apply
to anticoagulation therapy in NVAF patients, but evidence on this
issue is very limited. The results of our study indicate that nonpersistence with OAC was associated with a 79% higher risk of ischaemic stroke and ischaemic stroke-related death in NVAF patients
initiated on DOAC. These results are in line with the only available
study that investigated persistence pattern and clinical outcomes in
NVAF patients,21 which found being non-persistent with DOAC was
associated with an increased risk of stroke/TIA among dabigatran
users (HR 3.75, 95% CI 2.59-5.43) as well as among rivaroxaban
users (HR 6.25, 95% CI 3.37-11.58). However, the study had a relatively small sample size (as shown by the broad CIs), with outdated
data (between 1998 and 2014) and a short follow-up time (i.e.
6 months),21 which made our study necessary for confirmation.
Our findings warrant an improvement of OAC persistence to
achieve optimal outcomes in the anticoagulation management of
NVAF patients. Additional consideration on potential risk of being
non-persistent with OAC might be necessary when making decisions
on types of anticoagulant prescribed to NVAF patients. After we
stratified the analysis by baseline CHA2DS2-VASc score, we found
that for patients with a baseline CHA2DS2-VASc score <2, nonpersistence with OAC was associated with a reduced risk of the
composite outcome (HR 0.37, 95% CI 0.20-0.69). This finding can
possibly be explained by the fact that NVAF patients with a
CHA2DS2-VASc score <2 are not recommended by guidelines to receive long-term OAC therapy.44 These patients, who were at low
risk of ischaemic stroke at baseline, might receive short-term OAC
therapy due to other indications such as preparation for cardioversion or left atrial appendage closure. After the short-term use of
OAC, patients who are still at low risk of ischaemic stroke are likely
to stop using OAC, while OAC therapy is still indicated for patients
who developed into high risk of ischaemic stroke (i.e. a CHA2DS2VASc score of >_2). In our study, it could be observed that ischaemic
stroke events appeared to occur more frequently in the early stage
after patients became non-persistent with OAC when compared
with that in a later stage. This suggests that more attention should be
paid to patients who just stopped using OAC as could be done, for
instance, by pharmacies, with some success.45 However, it should
also be noted that association does not imply causation. Since the

surprising, an investigation on this endpoint, which was usually not
included in other studies, is at least important given that switching
from DOAC to VKA is possible.
The several baseline characteristics we identified as predictors of
non-persistence are worth being discussed. We found that male sex
was associated with poor persistence with OAC (HR 1.06, 95% CI
1.01-1.12). This is consistent with a large study from Germany,30
which found that male sex was associated with higher risk of DOAC
discontinuation (odds ratio 1.12, 95% CI 1.06-1.18) and a study from
Australia.31 However, there are also studies that reported contrary
results,22,32 which might be due to the fact that the reported relative
increase in non-persistence in men vs. women is often <10%. Unlike
sex, the associations between age and persistence pattern are consistent in most studies, indicating that an older age (usually above
65 years) is associated with better persistence.30,33,34 Our study had
a similar finding that patients aged 65-74 years were the most persistent with OAC, but we found that the risk of non-persistence
increased with age above 74 years. Paroxysmal AF was associated
with increased risk of non-persistence with OAC in our study, which
was also observed in a study that investigated the non-persistent use
of warfarin.35 Patients who had used VKA before a DOAC had better
persistence with OAC; however, an inverse association was
observed that patients who had used VKA before a DOAC had
worse persistence with the initial DOAC among patients who had a
baseline CHA2DS2-VASc score >_2. A potential explanation is that
patients who had used VKA before were more able to understand
the importance of anticoagulation therapy (through experience with
VKA therapy) and therefore were less likely to become nonpersistent with OAC when compared to those without experience
of VKA use. For the same reason, they may also be more likely to
switch back to VKA (knowing the medication and its use) after using
DOAC, so they showed worse persistence with DOAC, but better
persistence with OAC. As this explanation is speculative, it should be
handled with caution. Stroke history has been reported to be associated with better persistence,33,35 and as expected, a similar association was found in our study. Apart from stroke history, we also
found that marriage and not living alone were associated with better
persistence with OAC, which is consistent with other studies36,37
and suggests the role that family support and involvement might play
in facilitating anticoagulant compliance.38,39 Instead of exploring various individual comorbidities, we explored the association between
the baseline CHA2DS2-VASc score and persistence pattern. The result we found is comparable to other studies,34,40 suggesting that a
baseline CHA2DS2-VASc score >2 is associated with better persistence and adherence with DOAC. Our study also found some other
variables to be associated with an increased risk of non-persistence
with OAC, including immigration status, standardized household income, physical health, feeling of depression, unemployment, and the
ability to meet financial needs. Interpretations of these results should
be cautious, as some results were based on small sample sizes and
some variables have not been investigated in prior studies. The association we found for household income, showed a U-shaped curve
where those who had the lowest income and the highest income levels were those who were most likely to become non-persistent.
Interestingly, we showed in a previous paper on adherence with
DOAC that patients with a high education (who were most likely
also to have a high income) were amongst the groups that were most

4136

Limitations
There are also some limitations of the study. First, due to a data limitation, information about OAC prescribed in hospitals was unavailable, which could lead to misclassification of persistence as nonpersistence. This concern can be relieved for the following reasons:
(i) the 100-day gap we used to determine non-persistence is likely to
be longer than the average length of a hospitalization and (ii) such a
misclassification would only underestimate the risk of ischaemic
stroke associated with non-persistence with OAC. We aimed to include naive DOAC users in the study, but it cannot be ruled out that
a few non-naive DOAC users were also included, since phase III trials
about DOAC use in AF patients were conducted in the Netherlands
before 2013, and these DOAC prescription data were not included
in the medication data we obtained. Given the limited sample size of
this patient group compared to the whole study population, it should
not be rendered problematic. In addition, since DOAC prescription
data about the amount of medication for each prescription were unavailable, and variables such as diagnoses and covariates were identified or calculated mainly based on International Classification of
Diseases codes, the study could be prone to measurement error. For
example, the covariates CHA2DS2-VASc score and the adapted
HAS-BLED score were calculated from individual components such

as hypertension, alcohol abuse, and the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug, which may not be well captured in administrative
data, and lead to an underestimated frequency of risk factors in the
study population. However, in the analyses (Supplementary material
online, Table S8), it could be observed that the covariates such as
CHA2DS2-VASc score were well associated with clinical outcomes,
suggesting that the concern is limited.
Second, in our study, only diagnoses made in hospitals were examined, while in the Netherlands it is possible that a patient got the first
NVAF diagnosis and DOAC from a general practitioner. These
patients were excluded from our study population due to the lack of
an NVAF diagnosis in hospitals before the first DOAC prescription.
Considering in real practice most of these patients will be further
referred to cardiologists,47 we conducted a sensitivity analysis that
included patients with NVAF diagnosed within 1 month after the first
DOAC prescription, and consistent results were found (but not presented in the manuscript).
Third, due to the lack of information about specific types of
DOAC, we were unable to study variations in the persistence patterns of different types of DOAC, which were reported in another
study.48 Therefore, our results of cumulative incidence of nonpersistence with DOAC could be seen as an average estimation over
the different types of DOAC. However, for the results of the association between being non-persistent with OAC and the studied clinical outcomes, this limitation should not be problematic since the
efficacy of ischaemic stroke prevention between different types of
DOAC is considered to be equivalent.44
Fourth, the reasons for OAC discontinuation were unknown
which made analysis of why patients became non-persistent unavailable. Without this information, some patients might be misclassified
as being non-persistent with anticoagulation therapy. For example, a
patient might suffer cancer during the follow-up and be switched to
low-molecular-weight heparin, or a patient might receive left atrial
appendage closure during the follow-up and stopped using OAC
6-12 weeks after the procedure. Our definition would consider
these patients as non-persistent patients, but such misclassification
would only lead to an overall underestimation of the risk of ischaemic
stroke associated with being non-persistent with OAC. In addition,
there were four other studies that examined the associations between adherence patterns and clinical outcomes among AF patients
receiving DOAC, and they all showed that non-adherence was
associated with increased risk of several thromboembolic clinical
outcomes,33,49-51 but due to data limitation, our study cannot investigate adherence patterns and its potential impact on prognosis.

Conclusions
In conclusion, persistence with OAC decreased with time to 70%
after 4 years for adult DOAC-naive NVAF patients who started to
use DOAC for ischaemic stroke prevention between 2013 and 2018
in the Netherlands, which was associated with poor efficacy of ischaemic stroke prevention. Interventions might be needed to improve poor persistence, and the baseline characteristics we identified
could be helpful to identify those who tend to be non-persistent.

exact reasons for becoming non-persistent with OAC are unknown
in our study, the observed increased risk of adverse outcomes associated with non-persistence with OAC should be interpreted cautiously. Unmeasured confounding and reverse causality cannot be ruled
out in our study. For example, the observed increased risk of an outcome event after a patient became non-persistent with OAC
could also be explained by the reason for stopping OAC treatment
itself (such as frailty, need for a major surgery, or some other
life-threatening conditions), which was not necessarily a consequence
of the absence of anticoagulation therapy. It is worth mentioning
that a recent randomized clinical trial46 reported that a multilevel
motivational intervention increased persistence and adherence
with OAC in NVAF patients, but no significant impact on clinical
outcomes was observed, although this could also be due to a relatively short follow-up and few outcome events (chance of a type II
error).
Our study has several strengths. First, as a nationwide study, it provided the largest sample size so far with updated data and was nationally representative. Second, under the conservative definition of nonpersistence, the reported persistence pattern is not overestimated as
might have been the case in other studies. Similarly, the study design
could only underestimate the association between non-persistence
with OAC and ischaemic stroke-related clinical outcomes, since persistent stage has longer follow-up time under the conservative definition of non-persistence, which led to that more ischaemic stroke
events would be attributed to the persistent stage. This suggests the
negative impact of non-persistence with OAC on prognosis can only
be worse than what we observed. In addition, when evaluating the association between non-persistence with OAC and clinical outcomes,
various confounding factors were considered, including socioeconomic status (i.e. standardized household income) and the two scoring systems for evaluating risks of stroke and major bleeding (i.e.
CHA2DS2-VASc score and the adapted HAS-BLED score), which
also increases the robustness of our findings.
