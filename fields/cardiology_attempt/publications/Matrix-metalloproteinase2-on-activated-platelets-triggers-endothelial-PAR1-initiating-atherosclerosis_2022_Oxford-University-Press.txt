Aims

Platelets participate in atherogenesis with mechanisms not yet fully clarified. Vascular wall MMP-2 is involved in the
arterial remodelling accompanying atherosclerosis. Platelets contain and release MMP-2 but no informations are
available on its role in atherosclerotic lesion formation.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
We generated double knockout mice lacking the LDL receptor and MMP-2 only in circulating blood cells showing
and results
that they develop significantly lesser femoral intima thickening after photochemical-induced arterial damage and
atherosclerotic lesions in the aorta, measured by the en face method, after 4 months of atherogenic diet.
Moreover, repeated transfusions of autologous-activated platelets in LDLR/ mice on atherogenic diet significantly
enhanced the extension of aortic atherosclerotic lesions while transfusion of activated platelets from MMP-2/
mice did not. In vitro coincubation studies showed that platelet-derived MMP-2 plays a pivotal role in the development and progression of atherosclerosis through a complex cross-talk between activated platelets, monocyte/macrophages, and endothelial cells. Translational studies in patients with CAD and chronic HIV infection showed that
platelet surface expression of MMP-2 highly significantly correlated with the degree of carotid artery stenosis.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
We show a previously unknown mechanism of the pathway through which platelets expressing MMP-2 trigger the

initial phases of atherosclerosis and provide a mechanism showing that they activate endothelial PAR-1 triggering
endothelial p38MAPK signalling and the expression of adhesion molecules. The development of drugs blocking selectively platelet MMP-2 or its expression may represent a new approach to the prevention of atherosclerosis.

Our study demonstrates that platelet-derived MMP-2 plays a pivotal role in the very early phases of atherogenesis in hypercholesterolemic mice.
Circulating activated platelets expressing MMP-2 on their surface interact with PAR-1 of endothelial cells triggering signal transduction and activation with
the consequent exposure of adhesion molecules (i.e. VCAM-1), the latter in turn facilitate the adhesion and transmigration of monocytes through the
endothelial monolayer ultimately leading to atheroma formation. The interaction between MMP-2 expressed by activated platelets and endothelial cell

Translational Perspective
With this study, we demonstrate that platelet-derived MMP-2 plays a pivotal role in the very early phases of atherogenesis in hypercholesterolemic mice. Circulating activated platelets expressing MMP-2 on their surface interact with PAR-1 of endothelial cells (ECs) triggering signal transduction and activation with the consequent exposure of adhesion molecules, the latter in turn facilitate the adhesion
and transmigration of monocytes through the endothelial monolayer ultimately leading to atheroma formation. The interaction between MMP-2 expressed by activated platelets and EC PAR-1 may represent a novel therapeutic target for the prevention of
atherosclerosis.

Introduction
Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disorder that involves innate and adaptive immune responses,1 with immune cells playing a
crucial role in plaque formation.2 Circulating monocytes interact with
dysfunctional endothelium that has lost its anti-adhesive properties
to infiltrate the arterial wall, mature in macrophages, and generate
foam cells internalizing and oxidizing LDL, leading to the fatty streak
development.3

Platelets play an important role in recruiting inflammatory cells to
the sites of atheroma formation by favouring their arrest onto altered
endothelium.4 In particular, activated platelets favour leucocyte binding to vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and intercellular
adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expressed on activated endothelium
promoting their adhesiveness.5 Moreover, platelet-released CD40L
binds its cognate receptor CD40 on endothelial cells (ECs) triggering
the release of inflammatory mediators, such as IL-8 and MCP-1, and
the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS).6-8

Results
Platelet-derived MMP-2 is required for
atherosclerotic lesion development
Twelve weeks of atherogenic diet strikingly enhanced total serum
cholesterol concentrations in LDLR/ mice as well as in LDLR//
MMP-2/ double knockout (dKO) and in LDLR/ mice transplanted
with bone marrow from MMP-2/ mice (LDLR/-chimeric) but not
in MMP-2/ and in wild-type (WT) mice (Supplementary material
online, Figure S1).

Lipid-rich lesions in LDLR/ mice were localized especially in the

Lipid-rich plaques in serial aortic sections show a massive infiltra..

It is held that circulating blood platelets do not interact with normal endothelium but strongly interact with activated EC through
their GPIb engaging endothelial VWF and P-selectin.9,10 The interaction between activated EC and platelets in turn leads to platelet activation, with consequent enhanced surface expression of molecules
involved in intercellular adhesion processes, such as CD40L and Pselectin.11 Platelet P-selectin in particular is required for platelet binding to monocytes and neutrophils12 and brings about the delivery of
platelet-derived proinflammatory mediators to the vessel wall
favouring the exacerbation of atherosclerosis.13 Indeed, the selective
removal of platelet P-selectin, abrogating the interaction of platelets
with endothelium, was shown to prevent atherosclerotic lesion development in hypercholesterolemic mice.13 Consistently, repeated
injections of activated wild-type platelets in hypercholesterolemic
ApoE/ mice increased aortic plaque formation while the injection
of activated platelets from P-selectin/ mice did not.13 The direct
interaction of platelets with the endothelium appears to be required,
because when instead of platelets the supernatant of activated platelets was injected no increase of atherosclerotic lesions was
observed.13 Platelet/endothelium contact may also be relevant for
the deposition of other platelet-derived mediators, such as RANTES
and PF4, contributing to atherosclerosis.13
A crucial role in atherogenesis is played by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a family of zinc-dependent proteolytic enzymes that
degrade various components of the extracellular matrix, mediate tissue remodelling and facilitate the migration of smooth muscle cells
from the media to the intima during atherogenesis.14-16 Human platelets contain, release, and express on their surface upon activation
several MMPs, including MMP-2.17,18 Platelet-released MMP-2 exerts
local collagenolytic activity19 and is involved in the heterotypic interaction with other cells modifying the phenotype of the latter.20 Thus,
it is conceivable that platelet-derived MMP-2 may be one of the mediators involved in the progression of atherosclerosis.
Here, we provide the first genetic evidence that platelet-released
MMP-2 plays a critical role in initiating atherogenesis in hypercholesterolemic mice by triggering endothelial PAR-1, thus favouring EC activation, showing that platelets act as major players in the very early
stages of atherosclerosis development. Our findings identify platelet
MMP-2 as a novel potential therapeutic target for the prevention of
atherosclerosis development.

Figure 1 Platelet-derived MMP-2 is required for atherosclerotic lesion development. (A) Thickening of intimal/media of the femoral artery induced
by photochemical damage in hyperlipidemic mice is abolished by MMP-2 deletion. Intimal/media ratio of the femoral artery 21 days after photochemical injury in wild-type (n = 8), MMP-2/ (n = 13), LDLR/ (n = 6), dKO (n = 5), and LDLR/-chimeric (n = 6) mice kept on HFD for 12 weeks. Three
sections for mouse were analysed. One-way analysis of variance with Tukey's multiple comparisons test was carried out. (B) Representative photomicrographs of haematoxylin and eosin staining of femoral artery sections. Magnification is 600. Internal elastic lamina is indicated by arrowheads. At
least 8 sections for each artery were analysed. I/M ratio in LDLR/ sham-injured mice was 0.03 +/- 0.007 (n = 4). (C) Hyperlipidaemia-induced aortic
lipid plaque deposition is dependent on platelet MMP-2. Lipid-rich plaque deposition in total aorta (C) or in the aortic arch (D) of wild-type (n = 5),
MMP-2/ (n = 5), LDLR/ (n = 6), dKO (n = 9), and LDLR/-chimeric mice (n = 5). *P < 0.0001 vs. wild-type and MMP-2/; #P < 0.001 vs. LDLR/.
One-way analysis of variance with Tukey's multiple comparisons test was carried out. The deletion of MMP-2 in all tissues (dKO mice) or only in platelets (LDLR/-chimeric mice) significantly reduced the deposition of lipid plaques in the entire aorta (C) and in the aortic arch (D). The deletion of
platelet-derived MMP-2 seems to be especially important for plaque deposition in the aortic arch. Repeated transfusion of activated platelets
expressing MMP-2, but not of platelets deficient of MMP-2, enhances aortic plaque deposition. (E) Thrombin-activated (a) platelets from LDLR/,
dKO and MMP-2/ mice or resting (r) platelets from LDLR-/-mice were transfused i.v. every 4 days in thrombocytopenic LDLR/ mice, for 6 weeks.
Lipid-rich plaques were measured in the entire aorta using the en face method after staining with Sudan IV. Thrombocytopenia significantly reduced
aortic lipid-rich plaques (P < 0.01 vs. LDLR/ mice with normal platelet count). Repeated transfusion of activated platelets from LDLR/ mice
enhanced aortic plaque deposition while activated platelets from MMP-2/ mice did not. n = 6 mice for each group. All data are expressed as mean

Platelet-derived MMP-2 facilitates
transendothelial migration of
monocytes/macrophages
To clarify the role of platelet MMP-2 in monocytes/macrophages recruitment in the arterial intima, we measured transendothelial migration of mixtures of monocytes/macrophages with activated platelets.
Thrombin-stimulated LDLR/-platelets strongly triggered the transendothelial migration of monocytes/macrophages derived from either LDLR/ or MMP-2/ mice (Figure 4A). Confirmatory
experiments have been carried out using purified monocytes from
LDLR/ mice (Supplementary material online, Figure S9). On the
contrary, activated platelets from MMP-2/ mice did not elicit
macrophage transmigration, thus platelets must express MMP-2 at
their surface to facilitate transendothelial macrophage migration
(Figure 4B). Furthermore, the inhibition of PAR-1 on ECs, by the selective PAR-1 antagonist RWJ-56610, abolished macrophage transmigration (Figure 4C). Thrombin-activated platelets from LDLR/ mice
favour the transmigration of purified LDLR/ monocytes/

Co-incubation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs)
with thrombin-activated, but not with resting, platelets from LDLR/
mice triggered endothelial activation, as shown by a significant increase of adhesive molecules such as ICAM-1 (data not shown) and
VCAM-1. This effect was prevented by the pre-incubation of platelets
with a P-selectin-blocking antibody while no further reduction of
VCAM-1 expression was observed by blocking also platelet CD40L,
suggesting that platelet P-selectin is important for endothelial activation (Figure 3A). On the other hand, co-incubation of HUVEC with
thrombin-activated platelets from MMP-2/ mice did not trigger
endothelial activation despite expressing P-sel (Figure 3B), while the
co-incubation with activated platelets from P-sel/ mice, yet
expressing MMP-2 at their surface, still induced a significant increase
in endothelial VCAM-1 expression, although lower than that induced
by LDLR/ platelets, that was completely abolished by pretreatment with the selective MMP-2 inhibitor TIMP-2 (Figure 3A). The
lack of endothelial activation by MMP-2/ platelets was not due to
defective adhesion because the adhesion of platelets from MMP-2/
mice to activated HUVEC is not different from that of normal platelets (Supplementary material online, Figure S6).
Activated, but not resting, platelets from LDLR/ were able to
trigger VCAM-1 expression also by human aortic endothelial cells
(HAECs), an effect prevented by TIMP-2 (1 mg/mL) as well as by the
blockade of PSGL-1 using a selective antibody (Supplementary material online, Figure S7).
EC activation initiated by thrombin-stimulated platelets required
direct cell contact, in fact, when platelets were separated from
HUVEC by interposing a filter, activated platelet-triggered endothelial
VCAM-1 expression was strikingly reduced (Supplementary material
online, Figure S8).
These findings show that activated platelets activate ECs through a
mechanism involving both P-selectin and surface expressed MMP-2.

also abolished transendothelial migration triggered by activated platelets, suggesting that the interaction of platelet P-selectin with macrophage PSGL-1 is also relevant for this phenomenon (Figure 4C).
Thus, our data show that macrophage infiltration through
endothelium is triggered by the direct interaction between platelet
MMP-2 and endothelial PAR-1, with a mechanism involving also
P-selectin.

Platelet-derived MMP-2 activates
endothelial cell PAR-1
To clarify if the activation of ECs induced by activated platelets was
mediated mainly by platelet-derived MMP-2 or by platelet-P-selectin
we evaluated the phosphorylation of AKT and p38MAPK which are
involved, respectively, in the signalling pathways triggered by PAR-1

and PSGL-1 activation. Co-incubation of HUVEC with thrombinactivated platelets significantly enhanced AKT phosphorylation, an
effect abolished by TIMP-2 and by the selective PAR1 antagonist
RWJ-56610 (Figure 5A). Moreover, the MMP-2-generated tethered
ligand DPRSFLLRN21 directly activated EC PAR-1, as shown by the
enhancement of VCAM-1 expression assessed by flow cytometry
(Supplementary material online, Figure S11). On the other hand, the
phosphorylation of endothelial p38MAPK induced by thrombinactivated platelets was only partially inhibited by the blockade of
PSGL-1 on ECs with an anti PSGL-1 MoAb (Figure 5B). Moreover, active MMP-2 induced the cleavage of PAR-1 in HAECs, similarly to
thrombin (Figure 6A and B).
These data demonstrate that in the interaction between activated
platelets and EC, platelet MMP-2 is the main trigger of endothelial activation acting on EC PAR-1.

activated by platelets from LDLR/ and MMP-2/ mice was, respectively, 17.1+/-0.21% and 1.7+/-0.7% of positive cells. N = 5 experiments. (C) Platelet-induced macrophage transendothelial migration
was inhibited either by the preincubation of monocytes/macrophages from LDLR/ mice with the inhibitor of PSGL-1 and by the
preincubation of endothelial cells with a selective inhibitor of PAR1. In these experiments, platelets and monocytes/macrophages
were from LDLR/ mice. N = 3 experiments, at least five slides for
each experiment were analysed. (D) Thrombin-activated platelets
from LDLR/ induced purified LDLR/ monocyte transmigration
though IL-1b activated endothelial cells isolated from LDLR/ but
not from PAR3/ mice. N = 3 experiments, at least five slides for
each experiment were analysed. One-way analysis of variance with
Tukey's multiple comparisons test was carried out.

blotting, after co-incubation with resting or thrombin-activated platelets from LDLR/ mice.

platelets expressing surface MMP-2 contribute directly to atherosclerotic lesion formation as demonstrated by the exacerbation of
atherosclerosis produced by the repeated transfusion of activated
platelets expressing MMP-2 in thrombocytopenic LDLR/ mice but
not of activated platelets lacking MMP-2.
These results demonstrate an important role of plateletderived MMP-2 in the cross-talk between platelets, inflammatory
cells, and endothelium. Mice lacking MMP-2 display defective
in vivo platelet activation and form less circulating platelet/leucocyte aggregates,34 due to defective MMP-2-mediated potentiation
of platelet activation.21 Consistent with this, in the present study
we show that circulating platelet/leucocyte aggregates and platelet
P-selectin expression were reduced in LDLR/MMP-2 double
knockout mice as well as in LDLR/ chimeric mice. Thus, in vivo
platelet activation with the consequent expression of MMP-2 by
platelets seems to be required for atherosclerosis initiation.
Circulating activated platelets are commonly observed not only in
patients with atherosclerosis12,35,36 but also in subjects with
known risk factors for atherosclerosis, like type 2 diabetes mellitus,37,38 hypertension,39 and hyperlipidaemia.40 Moreover, platelet hyperreactivity and in vivo platelet activation are predictive of
the development and extension of atherosclerosis in humans.41-45
Several observations suggest that in vivo platelet activation actually precedes atherosclerotic plaque development, and in fact, the
control of risk factors favouring atherosclerosis progression
reduces in vivo platelet activation and hyperreactivity.44,46

To assess the translational value of our model data, we studied the
expression of MMP-2 on the surface of circulating platelets and its
possible association with the extent of atherosclerotic disease in a
group of patients with stable CAD or chronic HIV infection. We
show here that platelet MMP-2 was enhanced in patients with CAD
and HIV and it significantly and positively correlated with carotid artery stenosis. A prospective study is ongoing to further define the
pathogenic role of platelet-expressed MMP-2 for atherosclerosis
progression and CV events in patients at CV risk.
Our observation that the deletion of MMP-2 reduced in a particularly striking way the size of atherosclerotic lesions in the aortic arch,
the site where atherosclerotic lesions initially develop in mice, supports a role of platelet MMP-2 in the initial steps of atherogenesis.47
Our data show that platelet MMP-2 activates the endothelium by a
mechanism involving endothelial PAR-1. In fact, blockade of active
MMP-2 on platelets or of PAR-1 on the endothelium abolished AKT
phosphorylation, the signalling pathway downstream of PAR-1, in
ECs while blockade of PSGL-1 on the endothelium, the ligand of
platelet P-selectin, did not abolish p38MAPK phosphorylation.
Moreover, we show that active MMP-2 cleaves endothelial PAR-1,
similarly to thrombin.48 Upon activation, PAR-1 causes cytoskeletal
rearrangement in ECs that destabilizes cell-cell contacts causing an
increase in vascular permeability, which facilitates the passage of molecules and inflammatory cells from blood into subendothelium.49,50
Moreover, activated platelets bind circulating monocytes/macrophages through a mechanism involving P-selectin/PSGL-1 and favour

their transendothelial migration via the platelet MMP-2/endothelial
PAR-1 pathway. In this way, platelets expressing MMP-2 promote
macrophage infiltration into vascular tissue favouring the development of atherosclerotic plaques. Our study has some limitations. We
did not use a tissue specific gene deletion approach by generating
conditional strains MMP-2//PF4-Cre/LDLR/ and MMP-2//
PF4-Cre/wild type while to unravel platelet MMP-2 contribution we
adopted repeated cross-transfusions of platelets from MMP-2/
mice into thrombocytopenic LDLR/ mice. Although the Cre/loxP
strategy might elegantly support our conclusions, the cross

transfusion model we used, with all the appropriate controls, and the
large amount of confirmatory and mechanistic in vitro experiments
using cells/tissues from specific knockout mice, exclude significant
technical/biological bias in the interpretation of our results. Indeed,
this approach has been used with success and is still used, in several
important studies assessing the involvement of specific platelet and
leucocyte molecules in atherosclerosis.13,51,52 Another limitation is
represented by the lack of studies with specific pharmacological inhibition of MMP-2, which could have strenghtened our results.
Unfortunately, all chemical agents inhibiting MMP-2 are not

completely selective for MMP-2. We are currently intensively working on this issue and, in particular, we are working on the development of MMP-2-specific nanobodies.53 Unfortunately, nanobody
activity with mouse platelets seems to be weaker than with human
platelets.54
In conclusion, our findings have considerable impact on the understanding of the inflammatory mechanisms starting atherogenesis
throwing new light on the role of platelets in the very initial steps
which trigger leucocyte infiltration in the arterial wall, and have potential implications for the design of novel, selective anti-atherogenic
drugs considering that, in contrast to the current focus on slowing
the progression of advanced plaques after middle age, future therapeutic options should be targeted at earlier stages of the disease process with the intent to preempting the progression of cardiovascular
disease.55
