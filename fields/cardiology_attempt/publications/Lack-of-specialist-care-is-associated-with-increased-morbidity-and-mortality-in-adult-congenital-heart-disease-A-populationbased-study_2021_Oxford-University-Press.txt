Aims

The aim of this study was to provide population-based data on the healthcare provision for adults with congenital heart disease (ACHD) and the impact of cardiology care on morbidity and mortality in this vulnerable
population.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
Based on administrative data from one of the largest German Health Insurance Companies, all insured ACHD
and results
patients (<70 years of age) were included. Patients were stratified into those followed exclusively by primary care
physicians (PCPs) and those with additional cardiology follow-up between 2014 and 2016. Associations between
level of care and outcome were assessed by multivariable/propensity score Cox analyses. Overall, 24 139 patients
(median age 43 years, 54.8% female) were included. Of these, only 49.7% had cardiology follow-up during the 3year period, with 49.2% of patients only being cared for by PCPs and 1.1% having no contact with either. After
comprehensive multivariable and propensity score adjustment, ACHD patients under cardiology follow-up had a
significantly lower risk of death [hazard ratio (HR) 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67-0.98; P = 0.03) or major
events (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.78-0.92; P < 0.001) compared to those only followed by PCPs. At 3-year follow-up, the
absolute risk difference for mortality was 0.9% higher in ACHD patients with moderate/severe complexity lesions
cared by PCPs compared to those under cardiology follow-up.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
Cardiology care compared with primary care is associated with superior survival and lower rates of major compli-

cations in ACHD. It is alarming that even in a high resource setting with well-established specialist ACHD care approximately 50% of contemporary ACHD patients are still not linked to regular cardiac care. Almost all patients
had at least one contact with a PCP during the study period, suggesting that opportunities to refer patients to cardiac specialists were missed at PCP level. More efforts are required to alert PCPs and patients to appropriate
ACHD care.

Introduction
It is estimated that over 4 million patients with congenital heart disease are currently alive in Europe.1-3 As an increasing number of children born with congenital heart disease survive longer and enter
adulthood, around two-third of the contemporary congenital patient
population are adults and the number of adults with congenital
heart disease (ACHD) continues to increase at a rate of 60% per decade.4-6 Unfortunately, most ACHD patients cannot be regarded as
cured by the surgical or catheter interventions performed in childhood. Rather, the majority of patients continues to be afflicted by cardiac and extracardiac sequalae and complications. These chronic
medical issues include heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, ongoing risk
of infections and endocarditis, neurological, respiratory as well as

extracardiac end-organ disease.7-12 As a consequence, life-long specialized cardiac care is required in this vulnerable population.8,13
Previous studies from Australia and Canada have demonstrated the
positive impact of specialized tertiary care on guideline adherence as
a measure of process quality and overall mortality in ACHD
patients.6,14 As a consequence, consolidation of ACHD care and creation of superregional tertiary centres together with a process of individual training and accreditation for adult and paediatric
cardiologists is advocated and has been implemented in various countries in Europe and North America.15,16 Depending on the healthcare
system involved, the organisation of ACHD healthcare provision may
differ, however. Unlike in highly centralized health systems like the
English NHS, many healthcare systems are largely decentralized with
larger patient choice and ambulatory specialist medical services

Study design and overview over the main results illustrating the unmet need of regular cardiology follow-up in 50.3% of adult congenital heart disease
patients over a 3-year period. Care provided by primary care physicians was associated with worse outcome (mortality and freedom from death or major
adverse events) compared to follow-up by cardiac specialists.

Morbidity and mortality in adult congenital heart disease

Methods
Based on the administrative data from the German BARMER GEK Health
Insurance Company insuring around 1/9 of the German population, i.e.
9 million members, all ambulatory and inpatient procedures and diagnoses coded in the time period 2005-19 were available. The underlying
dataset contains an anonymized version of data required for reimbursement purposes. The data are, therefore, complete and data quality
aspects such as data integrity and representativeness for the general
population of Germany have been demonstrated.17 For the scope of the
analysis we focused on patients with congenital heart disease as encoded
based on the German modification of ICD-10 codes (Q20-26; for
detailed information see Supplementary material online, Table S1), aged
>_18 and <70 years throughout the study period. Underlying congenital
cardiac defects were stratified into mild, moderate, and severe complexity based on published recommendations.8 Patients with an isolated atrial
septal defect could not be included as this cardiac defect shares an ICD
code with patent foramen ovale in the German ICD-10 system. Patients
were included if they had a relevant congenital heart disease code provided between 2005 and 2019. Consistent with previous publications, to
ensure data quality, only patients who had relevant ICD-10 codes repeatedly recorded or in whom the qualifying code was provided by a cardiologist or during an in-hospital stay were considered.2,18 To assess the
association between level of care (i.e. community-based PCP care only
vs. follow-up by a paediatric or adult cardiologist), patients were stratified
based on whether they were only followed by a PCP or whether they
presented at least once to an office-based cardiologist or an ACHD
centre in the time period 2014-16 irrespective of PCP care. This 3-year
interval was chosen to account for the fact that especially patients with
simpler cardiac defects may require specialist consultations only every
few years based on current guideline recommendations.8 The start point
(January 2014) of the interval coincides with the availability of ambulatory
codes from ACHD centres in the underlying database, while the end of
the time interval (December 2016) was chosen to allow for a subsequent
3-year follow-up period after the allocation period. Patients were followed throughout 2017-19 and the occurrence of all-cause mortality or
a composite of death or major complications was assessed. Details on
the composite major adverse event endpoint, including death, successful
resuscitation, cardiac transplantation, implantation of a cardiac assist device, myocardial infarction, acute emergency admission to a cardiology or
cardiac surgery department or a composite of non-traumatic cerebral ischaemic or haemorrhagic event, are provided in the Supplementary

.. material online. To allow for varying baseline characteristics and risk pro..
.. files, both standard multivariable adjustment and propensity score adjust.. ment were performed adjusting for relevant co-existing diagnoses,
..
.. previous interventions (such as pacemaker/implantable cardioverter
.. defibrillators) or medication.
..
The study was approved by the relevant ethics committee as part of
..
.. the overarching research project using anonymized administrative health
.. insurance data (OptAHF project).
..
..
..
.. Statistical analysis
..
.. Continuous variables were summarized by medians and quartiles and
.. tested for group differences using Mann-Whitney U tests. Group com.. parisons between categorical variables were performed by the
..
.. Chi-square test. We fitted Cox proportional hazard models for time
.. from beginning of the event period (01 January 2017) to first composite
..
.. major adverse event endpoint or to death. For the composite major ad.. verse event endpoint, only first events were considered. For the overall
.. cohort and subgroups with a sufficient number of events, we fitted multi..
.. variable Cox regression models (without propensity scores), models
.. adjusted only for the logit of the propensity score, and also combinations
..
.. of both. Results were highly similar for all three variants. Since some of
.. the subgroups considered had insufficient numbers of events to allow for
.. a full Cox regression adjustment on all variables, we instead adjusted on
..
.. the propensity score and on further important variables (age, sex, heart
.. defect complexity, and presence of heart failure). Propensity scores were
.. calculated using logistic regression based on all concomitant diagnoses
..
.. and medications listed in Supplementary material online, Table S1. We
.. checked the overlap of propensity score distributions in the two groups,
..
.. which were found to essentially fully overlap, so that no patients were
.. excluded from the analysis.
..
Analysis was exploratory and partly data driven. No adjustment for
..
.. multiple comparisons was performed and P-values <0.05 were consid.. ered statistically noticeable/significant. Analyses were performed using
..
.. the software R version 3.6.2 (R Foundation, Vienna, Austria).

offered, both, on a hospital and an office-based level. Specialized
follow-up provided by general, office-based cardiologists working
alongside ACHD-trained cardiologists and tertiary centres is common in health care systems like the USA or Germany. Consequently,
beyond the impact of tertiary care, ambulatory cardiology follow-up
may affect morbidity and mortality of ACHD patients. However, robust data on this aspect of care are lacking but are required to guide
health political decisions, primary care physicians (PCPs), and
patients.
Using a comprehensive inpatient and ambulatory dataset of administrative data from one of Germany's largest health insurance companies (9 million members, representative of the German population),
we aimed to provide contemporary data on the effect of ambulatory
office-based cardiology follow-up on morbidity and mortality compared to isolated community-based PCP provided care across the
spectrum of ACHD.

complexity, and 10% high complexity lesions, P < 0.001). As illustrated in Table 1, patients linked to cardiology follow-up had a significantly higher proportion of cardiac and extracardiac co-morbidities
compared to those only followed by PCPs. While, by study design,
no patients under exclusive PCP follow-up presented to a cardiologist accredited for ACHD or a tertiary ACHD centre, 51.8% of
patients presenting to a tertiary ACHD centre also consulted a (general) office-based cardiologist during the study period. Similarly,
30.5% of patients presenting to an ACHD accredited paediatric or
general adult cardiologist also consulted a general cardiologist during
the study period.
During a cumulative observation period of 69 414 years after the
allocation period, corresponding to an average follow-up time of
2.88 years/patient, 524 patients died, and 2517 patients experienced
a major adverse event. The leading cause of non-lethal major adverse
events were emergency cardiac or neurology admission (n = 1831),
neurological complications (n = 501), survived resuscitation

severe lesion complexity (4.3% mortality and 15.6% major adverse
events) compared to patients with moderate complexity (2.4% mortality and 10.6% major adverse events) and mild complexity (1.9%
mortality and 9.8% major adverse events), respectively.

analysis comparing the effect of cardiology follow-up vs. mere PCP

follow-up was associated with a significantly lower risk of death [hazard ratio (HR) 0.81, 95% CI 0.67-0.98, P = 0.03] and major adverse
events (HR 0.85; 95% CI 0.78-0.92, P < 0.001) compared to patients
only followed by PCPs. These results were confirmed both on multivariable adjustment without propensity scores (HR 0.81, 95% CI

and HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.77-0.92; P < 0.001, for mortality and the combined endpoint, respectively). In pre-specified subgroup analyses, cardiology follow-up was associated with a significantly lower risk of
death specifically in females (HR 0.65; P = 0.005), patients over
45 years of age (HR 0.76; P = 0.01) as well as patients with moderate
or high complexity underlying heart defects (HR 0.73; P = 0.048). For
the composite endpoint of death or severe adverse events, multivariate propensity score-adjusted subgroup analyses revealed a significantly reduced risk in males (HR 0.82; P = 0.001), females (HR 0.88;
P = 0.046), patients over the age of 45 years (HR 0.77; P < 0.001),
patients with simple underlying heart defects (HR 0.85; P = 0.003) as
well as those with moderate or severe complexity cardiac defects
(HR 0.81; P = 0.007). The results of the stratified subgroup analyses
are presented in Table 2. Figure 1 shows the survival and freedom
from event curves for the two endpoints based on the results of the

linked to regular cardiology care. Despite lacking contact to cardiac
services, almost all patients had at least one contact with a PCP during the study period, suggesting that opportunities to refer patients
to cardiac specialists were present but were missed by the respective
family doctors. This is alarming as cardiology care provision was
found to be indeed associated with superior survival and a lower rate
of major cardiac and neurological complications in this population.
The positive impact of centralizing care at tertiary ACHD centres
has been documented based on the implementation of routine referral to specialized ACHD centres and following the introduction of
national ACHD guidelines in Canada.6 More recently, Cordina et
al.,14 using data from an Australian ACHD referral centre, reported
that patients followed by ACHD-trained cardiologists were more
likely to be treated according to guidelines compared with those
under the care of general cardiologists. To our knowledge, no robust
data on the impact of ambulatory general cardiology follow-up on
morbidity and mortality are available in ACHD. Current guidelines
recommend that all ACHD patients should consult an ACHD cardiologist at least once, with the majority of patients requiring regular
follow-up and treatment by appropriately trained ACHD cardiac specialists.8 Alarmingly, 49% of patients with congenital defects were
only seen by PCPs during a 3-year period in our study. This included
36% of patients with high and 45% of patients with moderate complexity underlying lesions. These percentages, thus, could serve as
estimates for the proportion of patients' lost to follow-up in the
German system. These findings suggest that failure to implement the
guidelines occurs at the lowest level of the medical system, namely at

the PCP level as the patients' first contact point for medical care. The
current data thus illustrate that loss-to-follow-up and lapses in appropriate care for ACHD patients do not equate to lack of contact with
the medical system per se but lack of vertical referral from PCPs to
specialized cardiology services. A first direct consequence of our
study is thus to increase PCP as well as patient awareness and encourage proactive and regular ACHD patient referral to outpatient
cardiology services. While potentially particularly relevant for ACHD
patients with more complex forms of congenital heart disease, we
contend that PCPs should be encouraged to cooperate with cardiac
services for all ACHD patients. This is due to the intricate nature of
ACHD and the fact that anatomy cannot be readily separated from

physiology in this setting.2 In addition, given the evidence provided,
we suggest to primarily focus efforts on ensuring vertical referral
from PCPs to local cardiologists rather than overburdening busy
frontline family physicians with the decision to stratify ACHD patients
into those requiring direct referral to specifically trained ACHD cardiologists or ACHD centres and those in whom referral to a general
cardiologist might suffice. This is based on our observation that care
provided by general cardiologists was highly intertwined with specialist ACHD services. In fact, over 50% of ACHD patients at tertiary
centres also consulted a general office-based cardiologist during the
study period, suggesting a close collaboration between these two
sectors. Furthermore, while cardiology care was associated with a

.. general cardiology care. This is also due to the fact that, given the na.. ture of the analysis, we lack some more granular data, for example on

.. the number of patients who died while being under ACHD specialist

..
.. Strength of the current report
.. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the largest cohorts pro..
.. viding a population-based real-world overview over the contempor..
.. ary care situation for ACHD in a high-resource setting. The current
.. report reveals the unmet needs in the follow-up and referral of
..
.. ACHD patients to cardiology services by using a large robust, com.. plete and representative administrative database. Unlike single centre
..
.. reports, the database covers all insured individuals irrespective of ter.. tiary centre follow-up, including also patients lost to cardiology
..
.. follow-up. Furthermore, the longitudinal data available including com.. plete information on all in- and outpatient contacts with the health..
.. care system as well as prescribed medication enabled us to adjust for
.. varying baseline characteristics of the patients.
..
..
.. Limitations
..
.. This is a retrospective study and the employed administrative data.. base was not primarily designed for research purposes. Specifically,
..
.. the underlying ICD-10 codes were not designed specifically for con.. genital heart disease and do not fully account for important anatomic
..
.. details in this context. Ideally a nomenclature system specifically
.. designed for this patient cohort such as the International Paediatric
..
.. and Congenital Cardiac Code system would be desirable to this end.
.. Further registry-based studies using more detailed coding systems
..
.. are suggested to further confirm the associations described here.22
..
.. Estimates of the percentage of patients lost to follow-up especially
.. for ACHD patients with simple defects should be interpreted with
..
.. caution as we chose a 3-year allocation period, which might be too
.. short for some patients at the best end of the spectrum of simple
..
.. ACHD. The results of the study should be interpreted within the
.. context of the German healthcare system and apply mainly to this
..
.. and similar devolved healthcare systems. We accept that the situation
.. may be different in highly centralized systems such as the English
..
.. NHS. We cannot exclude the possibility that PCPs did refer patients
.. to cardiology services, but patients ignored the advice and failed to
..
.. arrange for consultation appointments. Given the magnitude of the
.. problem, however, it appears unlikely that 50% of patients would ig..
.. nore the advice of their family physician and fail to arrange for appro.. priate appointments within a 3-year period. Due to the nature of the
..
.. study, it is possible that unobserved differences between the PCP
.. and cardiology follow-up groups existed at baseline and that these
..
. were not fully compensated despite the extensive multivariable and

lower mortality rate only in patients with more severe heart defects,
a lower major adverse event rate was also evident in patients with
simple lesions compared to PCP care, emphasizing that all patients
may benefit from specialist referral.
The results of the current study should not be misinterpreted as a
carte blanche to provide general cardiology care to all ACHD
patients without regular referral to specialized ACHD services. In
fact, ACHD patients should not be managed in isolation and without
involving specialized ACHD centres.2,8 Rather, it highlights the need
for the establishment and integration of specifically ACHD-trained
office-based colleagues and ACHD tertiary centres into the general
cardiology landscape. We cannot exclude the possibility that individual non-ACHD-trained cardiologists may unnecessarily delay referral
of patients to specialized centres, as highlighted by Cordina et al. previously.14 However, our study suggests that-at least in our studied
setting-general cardiology and specialist ACHD services appear
highly integrated and collaborative. Currently, 20 superregional, 3 regional ACHD units and 8 specialized ACHD practices have been
accredited in Germany.19 In addition, around 350 paediatric or adult
cardiologists have obtained training and specific accreditation for
ACHD. Given the rapidly increasing number of ACHD patients,
there remains a need for an increased specialized ACHD workforce
and accessible services closer to patients' homes. Compared to the
total number of ambulatory general adult and paediatric cardiologists
in Germany (over 2800 in the BARMER database), this number is still
low. Therefore, raising awareness and enabling training of general cardiologists continues to remain of importance. Giving that most
ACHD patients are co-managed by general cardiologists, the Cardiac
Societies should be encouraged to intensify ACHD training for the
general cardiology audience for example by giving ACHD-specific
topics greater room at national and international meetings or within
educational publications. In addition, patient information, education,
and involvement are key to improve compliance with regular followup recommendations and allow patients to act as their own advocates when confronting inappropriate primary care decisions.20,21
Overall, appropriate patient advocacy encouraging and enabling
patients to take ownership of their medical care through continuous
patient education and involvement seems to be a key element in
ensuring long-term adherence to high quality medical care. This process likely should be initiated early in life by paediatric cardiologists
and paediatric centres as well as be combined with a structured transition and transfer process to adult care over time.
We contend that the magnitude of the mortality and morbidity reduction in the current study was highly clinically relevant. At 3 years
of follow-up, an absolute risk difference in mortality of 0.9% was
observed in ACHD patients with moderate or severe complexity
cardiac defects under cardiology care compared to those with mere
PCP follow-up. If confirmed in a prospective manner, this number
would extrapolate to the potential to save one life per 100 ACHD
patients over 3 years if appropriate care would be provided. Similarly,
in the medium/severe complexity group, the absolute risk difference
between groups was 2.3% for the composite endpoint after 3 years
in favour of the cardiology care group.
Due to the nature of the analysis and especially the fact that
follow-up was limited and general cardiology and ACHD cardiology
care are highly intertwined, we abstained from analysing the specific
effect of specialized ACHD care on outcome in addition to having

propensity score-based statistical adjustment. As general cardiology
services and specialized ACHD care (including at tertiary centres)
are highly interrelated, we refrained from assessing the benefit of isolated specialized ACHD care beyond that provided by general cardiologist with the ongoing support by ACHD services.

Despite clear guideline recommendations requesting regular cardiology follow-up of ACHD patients, the current study demonstrates
that 50% of contemporary patients are not receiving appropriate
cardiology care even in a country with well-established specialized
ACHD care. Alarmingly, almost all patients were in contact with their
respective PCP during the study period, suggesting that opportunities
for cardiology referral existed but were missed. The fact that cardiology care was indeed associated with a significant clinically relevant
survival benefit and a lower rate of major complications in this population reinforces the need for action. Apparently, major efforts are
still required to alert PCPs and patients to appropriate ACHD care.
