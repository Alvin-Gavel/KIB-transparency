A 23-year-old patient without any risk
factor of thromboembolic disease presented with chest pain and breathlessness within 1 week of receiving the
COVID-19 vaccine. The patient's CT
revealed pulmonary emboli (Panel A)
and she was treated with Apixaban.
Despite treatment, her condition
deteriorated. Her blood results identified thrombocytopenia (73  109/L),
elevated D-dimer (17 548 lg/L), and
normal haemoglobin, clotting and
troponin. SARS-CoV-2 polymerase
chain reaction and antibody tests were
consistent with vaccination rather than
recent infection (anti-S IgG positive,
anti-Spike positive, and anti-Nucleo
capsid negative). A repeat CT showed
right ventricle (RV) thrombus (Panel B),
splenic vein thrombus (Panel C,
black arrow), and bilateral adrenal haemorrhage (Panel C, red arrows). Echo
cardiogram confirmed the RV thrombus. The patient's brain MRI showed high T2 areas in the cerebellum (Panel D) with restricted diffusion,
which could represent embolic infarcts or posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. The initial working diagnoses included infection,
catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome, and vaccine-triggered immune reaction. Investigations including broncho-alveolar lavage for viral/
bacterial/fungal infections, anti-phospholipid, and lupus anticoagulant screens were all negative. The patient required intubation and ventilation with plasma exchange, intravenous methylprednisolone, and heparin infusion. She made a full recovery. Based on our experience,
patients could also present with headache/seizures due to cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, and/or intra-parenchymal brain haemorrhage.
The syndrome is rare but as the vaccination rollout becomes global, early recognition of the syndrome among clinicians is key for prompt
treatment to minimize morbidity and mortality.
