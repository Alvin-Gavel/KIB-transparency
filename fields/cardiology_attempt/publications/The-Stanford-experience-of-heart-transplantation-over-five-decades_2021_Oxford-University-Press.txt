Aims

Since 1968, heart transplantation has become the definitive treatment for patients with end-stage heart failure. We
aimed to summarize our experience in heart transplantation at Stanford University since the first transplantation
performed over 50 years ago.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
From 6 January 1968 to 30 November 2020, 2671 patients presented to Stanford University for heart transplantand results
ation, of which 1958 were adult heart transplantations. Descriptive analyses were performed for patients in 1968-

95 (n = 639). Stabilized inverse probability weighting was applied to compare patients in 1996-2006 (n = 356) vs.
2007-19 (n = 515). Follow-up data were updated through 2020. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality.
Prior to weighting, recipients in 2007-19 vs. those in 1996-2006 were older and had heavier burden of chronic diseases. After the application of stabilized inverse probability weighting, the distance organ travelled increased from
84.2 +/- 111.1 miles to 159.3 +/- 169.9 miles from 1996-2006 to 2007-19. Total allograft ischaemia time also increased
over time (199.6 +/- 52.7 vs. 225.3 +/- 50.0 min). Patients in 2007-19 showed superior survival than those in 1996-
2006 with a median survival of 12.1 vs. 11.1 years.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
In this half-century retrospective descriptive study from one of the largest heart transplant programmes in the

USA, long-term survival after heart transplantation has improved over time despite increased recipient and donor
age, worsening comorbidities, increased technical complexity, and prolonged total allograft ischaemia time. Further
investigation is warranted to delineate factors associated with the excellent outcomes observed in this study.

Introduction
Since the first adult heart transplantation in the USA on 6 January
1968 by Dr Norman Shumway at Stanford University, the procedure has gained worldwide acceptance.1 Heart transplantation has
become the definitive treatment for patients with end-stage heart
failure. Although advancements in therapies have successfully
delayed the progression to end-stage heart failure, the incidence
and prevalence of heart failure continue to rise.2 In 2019, heart
transplantation was performed in 3552 patients in the USA compared to 3408 in 2018. The overall heart transplantation number
continues to increase globally. With the development of mechanical circulatory support (MCS) technologies, these devices have
been widely adopted since its inception.3 Over the past few decades, advancements in immunosuppression, treatment of graft rejection, and surgical techniques have also likely led to improved
survival after heart transplantation.4 However, differences in patient characteristics, surgical details, and outcomes over the years
remain unclear. The objective of this paper was to summarize and
describe our experience in heart transplantation at Stanford
University since the first transplantation performed over 50 years
ago.

Immunosuppression and antimicrobial
prophylaxis

Stabilized inverse probability weighting
Given the availability and reliability of prognostically important covariates,
only patients who underwent heart transplantation from 1996 to 2006
(n = 356) were compared to patients from 2007 to 2019 (n = 515) for
surgical details and outcomes. These two eras were chosen based on the
use and volume of MCS and the change in immunosuppressive regimen
to describe differences in two surgical epochs. Results for patients who
underwent heart transplantation from 1968 to 1995 (n = 639) are presented in a descriptive manner.
From 1996 to 2019, patient baseline demographics and characteristics
have changed. To ascertain the possible differences in outcomes if the
same type of patients had undergone heart transplantation in 2007-19 as
had undergone heart transplantation in 1996-2006, inverse probability
weighting method was used to reduce casemix differences between the
two time periods for descriptive analysis. To perform weighting, we first
stratified patients based on preoperative MCS use status and whether a
prior sternotomy had been performed. Preoperative MCS use was
defined as MCS implantation such as ventricular assist device (VAD),
intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), or Impella placement immediately prior to heart transplantation. Next, a non-parsimonious logistic regression model was used
for those who underwent surgical repair from 1996 to 2006 vs. from
2007 to 2019 to balance the preoperative characteristics between the
comparison groups to reduce differences in the casemix between the
two periods. Variables used for propensity score (PS) calculation were
age, gender, height, weight, and body mass index for both recipients and
donors, recipient preoperative characteristics: hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes, coronary artery disease, dialysis, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, and preoperative hospitalization, and recipient
preoperative laboratory results of haemoglobin, platelet, creatinine, total
bilirubin, aspartate transaminase, and alanine transaminase. Missing data
for these variables were imputed with the average probability for each
variable within the group. For each variable, a missing observation indicator was created. Stabilized inverse probability weighting (SIPW) was used
to estimate the average treatment effect using the following equation:
stabilizedweight  1/4 

ZPrdZ 1/4 1Th
PS

th

d1Z ThPrdZ 1/4 0Th
,
1PS

where Z represents time

period (Z = 1 for 2007-19 and Z = 0 for 1996-2006), and PrdZ  1/4  1Th and
PrdZ  1/4  0Th denote the marginal probability of the respective time period
in the overall sample.5,6 Inverse probability weighting also enabled the
creation of a pseudo-population of patients in 2007-19 similar to the
unweighted population of patients undergoing heart transplantation in
1996-2006 in terms of preoperative characteristics. This allowed us to
minimize patient-level casemix differences of those undergoing heart
transplantation during the two eras, therefore generating a reasonable assessment of differences in outcomes due to changes in clinical practice
between the two eras. However, an increase in the variability of the estimated effect can result from a very large weight from a very low PS.
SIPW therefore is an effective approach to solve this issue. Although the
stabilization may add in small bias in the estimation of effects, it has the important benefit of reduced estimate variability. Finally, the standardized
mean differences approach was used to assess the balance between the
comparison groups, achieved by the weighting design. A standardized
mean difference of <0.2 represents acceptable balance.7

Survival analysis
Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were performed on the weighted cohorts.
Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were also performed to
obtain the hazards ratio for overall mortality while adjusting for additional
preoperative variables including preoperative VAD implantation, ventilator support, and history of cerebral vascular accident.

Surgical anastomosis analysis
Patients who underwent heart transplantation using the bicaval (n = 446)
vs. biatrial anastomosis technique (n = 35) were identified for this subanalysis. Since the biatrial anastomosis technique was mostly used until
2012, the patient subgroup from 1996 to 2012 was used for this analysis.
To compare outcomes after using the two anastomosis techniques,
SIPW was performed using the same variables described above for PS calculation. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were performed.

Additional statistical analyses and details
Continuous variables were analysed using t-test. Categorical variables
were analysed using v2 test. All analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).

Results
Patient demographics and comorbidities
There were 639 (40.9%) patients who underwent heart transplantation at Stanford University between 1968 and 1995. Average age of
recipients at presentation for this historical cohort was 44.4 +/-
11.4 years, and 98 (15.3%) were female. Average body mass index at
presentation was 25.1 +/- 4.6 kg/m2. In terms of donor demographics,
average age was 25.8 +/- 8.9 years, and 25% were female. Donor average body mass index was 25.1 +/- 4.7 kg/m2.
For 1996-2006 vs. 2007-19, recipient and donor baseline demographics and comorbidities before and after weighting are shown in
Table 1. Prior to weighting, recipients in 2007-19 compared to those
in 1996-2006 were older (52.7 +/- 12.8 vs. 51.2 +/- 12.2 years) and had
heavier burden of chronic diseases, such as hypertension (272/53.2%
vs. 104/29.2%), hyperlipidaemia (241/47.1% vs. 74/20.8%), diabetes
(191/37.4% vs. 73/20.5%), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(75/14.7% vs. 11/3.1%). More recipients in 2007-19 compared to
1996-2006 underwent preoperative VAD implantation (156/30.7%

Our immunosuppression regimen has undergone several iterations. The
initial regimen included azathioprine, prednisone, and horse antilymphocyte serum. In 1973, horse anti-lymphocyte serum was switched
to rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (RATG). In 1981, cyclosporine and
prednisone became the mainstay of immunosuppression. In 2006, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) replaced azathioprine, and tacrolimus replaced
cyclosporine. Prednisone and RATG were continued. Our current immunosuppression regimen includes intraoperative methylprednisolone
500 mg IV, postoperative induction with RATG 1 mg/kg IV daily for three
doses, tacrolimus with trough goal of 10-15 ng/mL for the first 6 months,
MMF 1000 mg IV or PO twice daily, methylprednisolone 125 mg IV every
8 h for three doses, and prednisone 20 mg twice daily tapered over the
first year.
Opportunistic infection prophylaxis regimens currently are trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole for 1 year for Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis,
ganciclovir or valganciclovir for 6 months followed by acyclovir for 6
months for cytomegalovirus prophylaxis, itraconazole for 3 months, and
nystatin until steroids are discontinued for fungal prophylaxis. Since 1993,
aerosolized amphotericin has also been used postoperatively until discharge. Post-surgical prophylaxis includes cefazolin or vancomycin and
piperacillin/tazobactam for 48 h.

and received MCS (181/35.2% vs. 51/14.3%). Average donor age also
increased from 32.2 +/- 12.2 years in 1996-2006 to 34.1 +/- 12.6 years in
2007-19. Between 1996-2006 and 2007-19, there were no differences in donor hypertension (42/11.9% vs. 72/16.2%), diabetes (10/
2.8% vs. 12/2.5%), or intravenous drug use (159/45.4% vs. 166/

balanced after the application of SIPW, except for recipient coronary
artery disease and preoperative creatinine level (Table 1).

Operative details
A median sternotomy incision was routinely used. Organ donors
were transferred to Stanford University for organ recovery until
September 1973 when distant graft procurement was started.
Implantation was performed according to the biatrial operative technique originally described in 1960, bicaval technique, or modern
modified techniques.8,16
In 1968-95, average listed wait time was 195.6 +/- 222.9 days.
Distance organ travelled was 90.5 +/- 110.8 miles. Average cardiopulmonary bypass time and total allograft ischaemia time were
110.4 +/- 35.4 and 169.0 +/- 46.3 min, respectively. The operative details
from the weighted cohort from 1996-2006 to 2007-19 are shown in
Table 2. Notably, the average listed wait time was decreased to

between the two periods. Lastly, in both 1996-2006 and 2007-19,
the most common postoperative infection was pneumonia (20/6.1%
vs. 45/9.4%), followed by urinary tract infection (17/5.2% vs. 17/3.5%)
and septicaemia (9/2.8% vs. 17/3.6%). Postoperative infections
were most commonly bacterial in 1996-2006 vs. 2007-19 (46/13.6%
vs. 89/18.4%). Fungal (17/3.5% vs. 27/8.0%) and viral infections
(12/2.4% vs. 33/9.9%) were decreased in 2007-19 compared to
1996-2006.

Survival
Prior to the application of SIPW, the average lengths of follow-up for
patients undergoing heart transplantation in 1996-2006 vs. 2007-19
were 10.0 +/- 6.6 vs. 4.8 +/- 3.6 years. Patients in 2007-19 demonstrated
improved survival compared to those in 1996-2006 (Figure 1).
Improved survival was also observed when the historical patients
were included from 1968 to 1995 (Figure 2). After the application of
SIPW, the weighted 30-day and 1-year mortality rates were 11.0% vs.
3.1% and 18.8% vs. 10.4% for those in 1996-2006 vs. 2007-19.
Patients in 2007-19 continued to show superior survival than those
in 1996-2006 with a median survival of 12.1 vs. 11.1 years, respectively (Figure 3). Furthermore, patients who underwent heart transplantation in 2007-19 compared to those in 1996-2006 demonstrated
persistent superior 30-day and 1-year survival (Supplementary material online, Figure S1). Conditional 1-year survival analysis of patients
who survived at least 1 year after heart transplantation after the application of SIPW no longer demonstrated survival advantage in patients
who underwent heart transplantation in 2007-19 over those in
1996-2006 (Supplementary material online, Figure S2). From 1996-
2006, the leading cause of death for 1-year mortality was infection
(47.1%/16) followed by graft failure (32.4%/11), other non-cardiac
causes (17.6%/6), and malignancy (2.9%/1), whereas in 2007-19, graft
failure (54.2%/26) was the primary cause of death at 1 year, followed
by other non-cardiac causes (37.5%/18), infection (4.2%/2), and

performed using the SIPW weighted cohort from 1996 to 2019. In
1996-2006 vs. 2007-19, the hazard ratio for 1-year mortality was 3.1
(95% confidence interval of 2.0 and 4.8), and the hazard ratio for
overall mortality was 1.5 (95% confidence interval of 1.1 and 1.9).
Preoperative ventilator support was another independent risk factor
for 1-year mortality (hazard ratio 2.5, 95% confidence interval of 1.2
and 5.0) and overall mortality (hazard ratio 1.8, 95% confidence interval of 1.1 and 3.0).

Prior to the application of SIPW, there was no survival difference in
patients who received heart transplantation using the bicaval vs. biatrial anastomosis technique (Supplementary material online, Figure
S3). After SIPW, all variables used for weight calculation were appropriately balanced, except for recipient height, preoperative platelet
count, and total bilirubin (Supplementary material online, Table S1).
There was no difference in cross-clamp time (97.3 +/- 29.5 vs.
97.9 +/- 36.2 min), cardiopulmonary bypass time (158.3 +/- 42.5 vs.
193.4 +/- 98.5 min), or total allograft ischaemia time (218.1 +/- 52.0 vs.
200.2 +/- 51.7 min) using the bicaval vs. biatrial anastomosis technique.
In terms of postoperative outcomes, between bicaval vs. biatrial anastomosis, there was no difference in hospital length of stay
(18.0 +/- 20.4 vs. 22.7 +/- 27.5 days), primary graft dysfunction (23/5.1%
vs. 1/3%), severe bleeding or cardiac tamponade requiring reoperation (18/4.1% vs. 1/2.7%), pacemaker implantation (25/5.6% vs. 3/
8.3%), infection such as pneumonia (36/8.0% vs. 2/5.0%), urinary tract
infection (11/2.5% vs. 2/5.2%), and septicaemia (12/2.7% vs. 1/3.8%),
or severe rejection within the first year requiring hospitalization (41/
9.1% vs. 5/13.3%). Four patients (1.2%) in the bicaval anastomosis
group compared to 0 patients in the biatrial anastomosis group
required tricuspid valve intervention for severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) postoperatively. The weighted 30-day and 1-year mortality
rates after using bicaval vs. biatrial anastomosis were 4.0% vs. 4.2%
and 13.7% vs. 9.7%, respectively. The overall survival of heart transplantation patients using the bicaval vs. biatrial anastomosis technique
was similar (Supplementary material online, Figure S4).

Discussion
In this half-century retrospective study from one of the largest heart
transplant programmes in the USA, long-term survival after heart
transplantation has improved over time (Graphical abstract). This is in
accordance with the global trend in heart transplantation outcomes.4,9,10 We hypothesize that this outcome improvement was
likely associated with multiple factors. As surgeons gain more experience with heart transplantation, the improved donor management
could have a positive impact on heart transplant recipient outcomes.11 Additionally, with increased experience in organ procurement, we continued to improve donor allograft preservation
methodology in an effort to reduce total allograft ischaemic time.12,13
Early postoperative outcomes also greatly benefitted from shortterm MCS use.14 Finally, long-term allograft surveillance and management with advanced immunosuppression regimen has continued to
improve over time.
In this study, we observed that in addition to an increase in technical complexity, recipient and donor age as well as comorbidities

also increased over the decades. This creates one of the main challenges in making meaningful comparisons for patients undergoing
heart transplantation during different eras. Given the patient composition changes over time, the SIPW methodology allowed us to effectively account for the changes to compare patients with similar
observed preoperative characteristics during different time periods.
Furthermore, total allograft ischaemia time increased. We believe
that this was associated with an increase in organ distance travelled,
which was likely due to the geographic location of our institution.
Located in Northern California with only a few large transplant
centres in the west coast, we regularly accept organs from a very
broad range of geographic locations, as reflected by the wide range
and high average distance organs travelled.15 Despite these changes,
our heart transplantation outcomes continued to improve.
Interestingly, the survival advantage observed in recent years was primarily due to the improved short-term outcomes within the first
year after heart transplantation. Preoperative ventilator support was
a consistent risk factor for overall and 1-year mortality. We hypothesize that patients who were intubated preoperatively had heavier
burden of chronic diseases and likely also require advanced support
using MCS.
Since our programme's inception in 1968, our annual number of
heart transplantations has continued to rise (Supplementary material
online, Figure S5, S6). In 2020, 86 adult isolated heart transplantations
were performed. With our increasing experience in cardiac transplantation, we adopted modified techniques to reduce total allograft
ischaemia time and warm ischaemia time in select patients.16,17 As
demonstrated in this article, even though the total allograft ischaemia
time increased over time, the warm allograft ischaemia time was
reduced by half in recent years. We believe that this decrease in
warm allograft ischaemia time may also play an important role in the
improved outcomes observed in this study, as a previous study
showed exacerbated acute rejection in lung allografts with prolonged
warm ischaemia time.18 Although it is known that increased total allograft ischaemia time was associated with worsened outcomes,19 the
exact relationship between warm allograft ischaemia time and postoperative outcomes warrants further analysis.
In addition to using modified techniques to reduce allograft ischaemia time, we have developed strategies to expand our recipient eligibility criteria and consider marginal donors.20-26 This was associated
with excellent outcomes, even in highly complex cases. With the advancement of allograft preservation techniques such as the
TransMedics warm perfusion organ care system13 and Paragonix
SherpaPak cold transport system, we are actively exploring the avenues to further expand our donor pool by harvesting allografts across
half of the country.
MCS, such as IABP, ECMO, and VAD, has evolved into a bridge to
transplant or destination therapy, and the global use of MCS has
increased dramatically since 2007.4,27 At Stanford, MCS use continues to grow in both pre- and post-operative settings as shown in this
study. Since October 2018, the new organ allocation system has
placed higher priority for patients who require short-term MCS support rather than those who have received durable VADs. We anticipate that the number of MCS use as bridge to transplant will
continue to increase. Specifically, left VAD has been shown to be
associated with improved pulmonary vascular resistance.28 Select
patients who were initially considered not suitable for isolated heart

Though many factors can affect the development of CAV, immunologic mechanisms play the predominant role in the chronic rejection
process.36 At our institution, heart retransplant recipients would receive the same steroid treatment and a course of induction therapy
with RATG. Even though our overall heart transplantation volume
continues to expand, our centre's heart retransplantation rate
remained stable during the recent decade. This trend may be another
reflection of the improvement in long-term management posttransplantation.
Although changes in immunosuppression regimen have been
shown to be associated with improved outcomes, continued survival
improvement in the recent decade independent of immunosuppression regimen changes suggests that other factors may also contribute
significantly to this clinical observation. For example, our matching
process has evolved greatly over time. Initially, crude cell-based cross
matching analyses were performed by mixing donor lymphocytes or
lymph nodes with recipients' serum. Our current methods introduced more than a decade ago are much more sophisticated and include human leucocyte antigen cross matching and pre-transplant
panel reactive antibody analyses. Patients who were noted to be highly sensitized would undergo desensitization treatment with IVIg with
or without plasmapheresis treatment. Our rejection rates were also
noted to have dropped, along with improved overall outcomes.
Better donor-recipient matching may be one of the key factors in
outcomes improvement.
The incidence of post-transplantation TR decreased since the
introduction of bicaval anastomosis implantation technique by
Yacoub et al. in 1989.37,38 This was thought to be related to the
decreased right atrial pressure and preserved right atrial size associated with using the bicaval rather than the biatrial anastomosis technique.39 Though the bicaval anastomosis technique was previously
found to be associated with superior short-term outcomes, longterm survival was similar compared to using the biatrial anastomosis
technique.39 In this study, we attempted to evaluate the impact of the
bicaval vs. biatrial anastomosis technique and did not find either anastomosis technique to negatively impact postoperative outcomes or
the need for future reoperation for tricuspid valve dysfunction.
However, given the small sample size for the biatrial anastomosis
group, it was difficult to achieve perfect balance after SIPW. The low
incidences of tricuspid reintervention after heart transplantation also
made it difficult to draw any conclusions. Therefore, the inference
must be carefully drawn, and a more comprehensive analysis is
needed to fully investigate the treatment effect of each anastomosis
technique.
Post-transplant TR was also thought to be associated with endomyocardial biopsy (EMB), which may cause flail leaflets.40-42 At our
centre, surveillance for rejection was performed using EMB.43,44 Up
until a decade ago, EMB was performed weekly for the first month,
followed by monthly for the first 6 months, then every 2-3 months
until 3 years, and lastly every 6 months until 5 years after transplantation. Nowadays, EMB is performed if clinically indicated.
Technologies such as AllosureV and AllomapV are used about
3 months after transplantation for non-invasive surveillance. Most recently, cell-free DNA analysis showed evidence of detecting early
graft injury after lung transplantation45 and may be used alongside or
even replace EMB in the future for monitoring clinical antibodymediated allograft rejections.

transplantation may be reconsidered again if their pulmonary vascular
resistance improves after being on left VAD support. For patients
who require pre-transplant ECMO support for left ventricular
unloading, they can be weaned off of ECMO by using low dose inotropes, and then transitioned to IABP and potentially Impella. The left
ventricular apex can also be cannulated to further unload the ventricle to prevent pulmonary oedema related to left ventricular
dilation.
In this study, we stratified the cohort by preoperative MCS use but
did not include individual MCS into the regression model for PS calculation, because it has been shown that the use of MCS as bridge to
transplant was not associated with worse survival compared to that
after direct primary transplantation.4,9,10,29 There was also no difference in mortality on pump support compared with post-transplant
mortality among those bridged from ECMO to VAD or heart transplantation based on the United Network for Organ Sharing database.30 In another study, ECMO use was found to be associated with
improved survival to discharge or transfer.14 The preoperative MCS
provided to the recipients is another reflection of clinical practice
change over time as the technologies have gained wider adoption
with evidence supporting the safety and benefits of preoperative
MCS. The recent decade was associated with increased use of postoperative ECMO support, reflecting changes in postoperative patient
management strategy over time. Our threshold for considering
patients for ECMO support has decreased as short-term MCS technology continues to mature. Given our growing experience in
ECMO, we believe that it is safer to place patients with severe
primary graft dysfunction on ECMO support rather than relying on
high dose inotropes and vasopressors. Similarly, we have a low
threshold to initiate continuous renal replacement therapy in the
early postoperative period to protect patients from acute kidney injury, volume overload-related right ventricular failure, and the associated sequalae.
The immunosuppression and antimicrobial prophylaxis regimens
have undergone significant changes over time. Before the RATG was
introduced in 1973, average hospital length of stay after transplantation was 69 days, and 10-15% of recipients would experience rejection within the first year of transplantation.31 After the RATG was in
use, hospital length of stay decreased by almost half.31 In the past,
patients who had severe rejections would receive solumedrol and
RATG with or without intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), rituximab,
or bortezomib treatment. Most recently, eculizumab and tocilizumab
were introduced, but specific anti-rejection regimen varies depending
on grading, type, and clinical symptoms. In December 1980, cyclosporine was introduced with significant outcomes improvement.31
However, renal toxicity was observed, and the dosage was decreased
from 17 mg/kg. In 2006, tacrolimus replaced cyclosporine, and MMF
replaced azathioprine.32 Currently, we are revising our immunosuppressant regimen so that RATG induction may only be indicated for
those who are highly sensitized, with poor renal function, or are
young African American women, while the steroid regimen may be
biopsy result-based, allowing faster tapering schedule.
Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is one of the most common
indications for re-transplantation.33-35 CAV is typically treated with
mTOR inhibitors, such as sirolimus or everolimus, and statins.
Chronic rejection in the form of CAV is one of the major factors that
affects long-term graft and patient survival after heart transplantation.

This was a retrospective single-centre study. Although the generalizability of the results is uncertain, as a historical review of the natural
history of heart transplantation at a high-volume centre with more
granular data than what national and international registries can provide, this study offers extremely unique perspectives. The other limiting factor of this study was its incomplete data for patients prior to
the adoption of the electronic medical record system. Significant effort has been made to retrieve data in all forms, but the limiting factor
of incomplete data may be the nature of a large, retrospective study
spanning over half a century. Lastly, even though several sub-analyses,
such as the impact of preoperative short-term MCS on patient outcomes, would be interesting to conduct to further elucidate the differences observed in this study, they were not feasible to perform
due to the low incidences.
In conclusion, in this half-century retrospective descriptive study
from one of the largest and longest running heart transplant programmes in the USA, long-term survival after heart transplantation
has improved over the decades, despite increased recipient and
donor age, worsening comorbidities, increased technical complexity,
and prolonged total allograft ischaemia time. Though this study does
not attempt to pinpoint the causal mechanisms that led to the
changes in outcomes, it does provide important insights into what
has changed over time. Improved matching, sensitivity testing, and
heart failure treatment along with the evolution of immunosuppression medications and MCS may have all contributed to the excellent
outcomes observed in the modern era.
