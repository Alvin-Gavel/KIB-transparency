Despite the fact that the electrocardiogram (ECG) has been in use
for >100 years and is a central tool in clinical medicine, we are only
now beginning to unleash its full potential with the application of artificial intelligence (AI).1-5 This Focus Issue on arrhythmias contains the
State of the Art Review 'Application of artificial intelligence to
the electrocardiogram' by Zachi Attia from the Mayo Clinic,
Rochester, MN, USA, and colleagues.6 The authors note that AI has
given the ECG and clinicians reading it superhuman diagnostic abilities. Trained without hard-coded rules by finding often subclinical
patterns in huge datasets, AI transforms the ECG, a ubiquitous, noninvasive cardiac test that is integrated into practice workflows, into a
screening tool and predictor of cardiac and non-cardiac diseases,
often in asymptomatic individuals. This review describes the mathematical background behind supervised AI algorithms and discusses
selected AI ECG cardiac screening algorithms including those for the
detection of left ventricular dysfunction, episodic atrial fibrillation
from a tracing recorded during normal sinus rhythm, and other structural and valvular diseases. The ability to learn from big datasets, without the need to understand the biological mechanism, has created
opportunities for detecting non-cardiac diseases such as coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) and introduced challenges with regards to
data privacy. Like all medical tests, the AI ECG must be carefully vetted and validated in real-world clinical environments. Finally, with mobile form factors that allow acquisition of medical-grade ECGs from
smartphones and wearables, the use of AI may enable massive scalability to democratize healthcare.
Patients with permanent atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure
(HF) are often treated with pharmacological rate control. However,
the optimal rate control in patients with AF and HF is unknown.7 Not
only rapid heart rate but also its irregularity may contribute to

symptoms and possibly to impaired prognosis. In patients with AF
and HF, strict and regular rate control with atrioventricular junction
ablation and biventricular pacemaker has been shown to be superior
to pharmacological rate control in reducing HF hospitalizations. In a
Fast Track clinical research article entitled 'AV junction ablation
and cardiac resynchronization for patients with permanent
atrial fibrillation and narrow QRS: the APAF-CRT mortality
trial', Michele Brignole from the IRCCS Istituto Auxologico Italiano
in Milano, Italy, and colleagues point out that whether or not ablation
and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) also improve survival is
unknown.8 In this international, open-label, blinded outcome trial, the
authors randomly assigned patients with severely symptomatic permanent AF >6 months, narrow QRS (<_110 ms), and at least one HF
hospitalization in the previous year to Ablation th CRT or to pharmacological rate control. A total of 133 patients were randomized. The
mean age was 73 years, and 47% were females. The trial was stopped
for efficacy at interim analysis after a median of 29 months of followup per patient. The primary endpoint occurred in 7 patients (11%) in
the Ablation th CRT arm and in 20 patients (29%) in the control arm
[hazard ratio (HR) 0.26; P = 0.004]. The estimated death rates at 2
years were 5% and 21%, respectively; at 4 years, these were 14% and
41%. The benefit of Ablation th CRT on all-cause mortality was similar in patients with ejection fraction (EF) <_35% and in those with EF
>35%. The secondary endpoint combining all-cause mortality or HF
hospitalization was significantly lower in the Ablation th CRT arm
(HR 0.40; P = 0.002) (Figure 1).
The authors conclude that Ablation th CRT is superior to pharmacological therapy in reducing mortality in patients with permanent AF
and narrow QRS who were hospitalized for HF, irrespective of their
baseline EF. The contribution is linked to a thought-provoking
Editorial by Cecilia Linde from the Karolinska Institutet in
Stockholm, Sweden.9 Linde concludes that the results of APAF-CRT
are indeed impressive. With this addition to the APAF-CRT

morbidity trial, we now know that AV junction ablation combined
with CRT improves mortality and HF morbidity, and thus is a superior
strategy for rate control in elderly HF patients with permanent AF.
In a second Fast Track Clinical Research article entitled 'Mutation
location and IKs regulation in the arrhythmic risk of long
QT syndrome type 1: the importance of the KCNQ1 S6 region', Peter J. Schwartz from the IRCCS in Milan, Italy, and colleagues
assessed whether mutations neighbouring p.A341V in the S6 channel
segment could increase arrhythmic risk.10 Clinical and genetic data
were obtained from 1316 long QT syndrome type 1 (LQT1) patients
(450 families, including 277 patients p.A341V-positive subjects, 139
patients with p.A341-neighbouring mutations, and 900 other LQT1
subjects). A first cardiac event represented the primary endpoint. S6
segment missense variant characteristics, particularly cAMP stimulation responses, were analysed by cellular electrophysiology. p.A341neighbouring mutation carriers had a QTc shorter than p.A341V carriers (477 +/- 33 ms vs. 490 +/- 44 ms) but longer than the remaining
LQT1 patient population (467 +/- 41 ms) (P < 0.05 for both). Similarly,
the frequency of symptomatic subjects in the p.A341-neighbouring subgroup was intermediate between that of the other two groups (43% vs.
73% vs. 20%; P < 0.001). p.A341 and p.A341-neighbouring mutations
were associated with a more deleterious arrhythmia phenotype and a
poorer cumulative survival than mutations from any other region. The
differences in clinical severity can be explained, for p.A341V vs. p.A341neighbouring mutations by the p.A341V-specific impairment of IKs

regulation. The differences between the p.A341-neighbouring subgroup
and the rest of LQT1 mutations may be explained by the functional importance of the S6 segment for channel activation.
The authors conclude that while the p.A341V mutation stands out in
severity, as previously reported, largely due to its loss of PKA-dependent IKs regulation, all other p.A341-neighbouring mutations tested
show an almost normal IKs enhancement. Nonetheless, they do correlate with a more severe phenotype compared to all other LQT1 mutations (although not due to PKA insensitivity). This manuscript is
accompanied by an Editorial by Andrew Tinker from the Queen Mary
University of London in the UK.11 Tinker concludes that the study by
Schwartz and colleagues identifies a series of mutations at and around
A341 that lead to worse outcomes than those in other regions of the
channel. These mutant complexes do not show impaired PKA regulation, and the exact molecular mechanism will need further experimentation. In addition, as polygenic risk scores are developed for several
cardiovascular traits including ventricular arrhythmia, it will be interesting to see whether these can also contribute to additional risk stratification in long QT syndrome and other hereditary arrhythmic syndromes.
Alcohol consumption is associated with an increased risk of incident atrial AF. Not only heavy drinking but also a 'low spectrum of alcohol consumption' could be a risk factor for incident AF. In a Clinical

Seoul National University Hospital in Korea, and colleagues
evaluated the association between alcohol consumption status (and
its changes) after newly diagnosed AF and the risk of ischaemic
stroke.12 Using the Korean nationwide claims and health examination
database, the authors included subjects who were newly diagnosed
with AF between 2010 and 2016. Patients were categorized into
three groups according to the status of alcohol consumption before
and after AF diagnosis: non-drinkers; abstainers from alcohol after AF
diagnosis; and current drinkers. The primary outcome was incident ischaemic stroke during follow-up. Non-drinkers, abstainers, and current drinkers were compared using incidence rate differences after
inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW). Among a total of
>97 000 newly diagnosed AF patients, 51% were non-drinkers, 13%
were abstainers, and 36% were current drinkers. During follow-up,
3120 patients were diagnosed with incident ischaemic stroke (10 per
1000 person-years). At 5-year follow-up, non-drinkers and abstainers
were associated with a significantly lower risk for stroke than current
drinkers (incidence rate ratios after IPTW, 0.75 and 0.83, respectively) (Figure 2).
The authors conclude that current alcohol consumption is associated with an increased risk of ischaemic stroke in patients with newly
diagnosed AF, while alcohol abstinence after AF diagnosis could reduce the risk of ischaemic stroke. Lifestyle intervention, including attention to alcohol consumption, should be encouraged as part of a
comprehensive approach to AF management to improve clinical outcomes. The contribution is linked to an interesting Editorial by
Andrea Russo from the Cooper University Hospital Camden, NJ,
USA.13 Russo highlights that the authors should be commended on
further highlighting the importance of modifiable risk factors, including alcohol intake, in an integrated approach to healthcare delivery
for the treatment of AF. In addition to rate control, rhythm control
and anticoagulation, risk factor management is now considered the
"fourth pillar" of AF care. While more research is needed to identify
mechanisms by which alcohol cessation may result in improved outcomes and stroke reduction, an integrated and comprehensive approach to care is essential for patients with AF.
The issue is also complemented by two Discussion Forum contributions. In a commentary entitled 'Prediction of sudden arrhythmic death in patients with heart failure: towards validation
in a worldwide broader range of patients',14 Ryomo Fukuoka
from the School of Medicine, Chiba, Japan, and colleagues comment
on the recent publication 'Predicted benefit of an implantable
cardioverter-defibrillator: the MADIT-ICD benefit score': by
Arwa Younis from the University of Rochester Medical Center in
New York, USA, and colleagues.15 Younis et al. respond in a separate
comment.16
