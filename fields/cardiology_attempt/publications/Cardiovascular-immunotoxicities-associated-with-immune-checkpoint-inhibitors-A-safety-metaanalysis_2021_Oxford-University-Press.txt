See page 4978 for the editorial comment for this article 'Immune checkpoint inhibitors and cardiovascular events among patients with
cancer: a window into the critical role of the immune system in cardiovascular biology', by L. Kondapalli and T.G. Neilan, https://doi.org/
10.1093/eurheartj/ehab708.

Aims

The risk and incidence of cardiovascular (CV) immune-related adverse events (irAEs) associated with immune
checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in cancer patients remain unknown.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
We systematically reviewed all randomized clinical trials (RCTs) including at least one ICI-containing arm and availand results
able CV adverse event (CVAE) data in cancer patients in the ClinicalTrials.gov registry, Medline, and the Cochrane
CENTRAL Register of Controlled Trials, up to 31 August 2020 (CRD42020165672). The primary outcome was
the summary risk of 16 different CVAEs associated with ICI exposure vs. controls (placebo and non-placebo) in
RCTs. CVAEs with an increased risk associated with ICI exposure were considered as CV irAEs. Summary incidences of CV irAEs identified in our primary outcome analyses were computed using all RCTs including at least one
ICI-containing arm. We used a random-effects meta-analysis to obtain Peto odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence
intervals (CIs) and logit transformation and inverse variance weighting to compute summary incidences. Sixty-three
unique RCTs with at least one ICI-containing arm (32 518 patients) were retrieved, among which 48 (29 592
patients) had a control arm. Among the 16 CVAEs studied, ICI use was associated with an increased risk of 6 CV
irAEs including myocarditis, pericardial diseases, heart failure, dyslipidemia, myocardial infarction, and cerebral arterial ischaemia with higher risks for myocarditis (Peto OR: 4.42, 95% CI: 1.56-12.50, P < 0.01; I2 = 0%, P = 0.93) and
dyslipidemia (Peto OR: 3.68, 95% CI: 1.89-7.19, P < 0.01; I2 = 0%, P = 0.66). The incidence of these CVAEs ranged
from 3.2 (95% CI 2.0-5.1) to 19.3 (6.7-54.1) per 1000 patients, in studies with a median follow-up ranging from
3.2 to 32.8 months.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
In RCTs, ICI use was associated with six CV irAEs, not confined to myocarditis and pericarditis.

Introduction
With indications spanning multiple tumour types, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) used in monotherapy have become the standard of care for many types of cancer.1 Although these novel
immunotherapies were initially designed to treat advanced, refractory, or relapsed cancers, numerous ICIs, most commonly targeting
programmed death-1 (PD-1), its ligand (PD-L1), and cytotoxic Tlymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4), are increasingly being
used in early disease settings.2 The number of patients receiving ICIs

has increased in recent years and will continue to grow because indications for these therapies are ever expanding.1,2 Due to the mechanism of action of ICIs, immune-related adverse events (irAEs)
against normal tissue were anticipated.3 With the growing number of
treated patients, adverse events (AEs) associated with ICI use represent a real challenge for physicians, especially rare events for which
standardized guidelines have not been established.3
Cardiovascular AEs (CVAEs) represent major issues for patients
with cancer, during and after cancer treatment, and the frequency of
CVAEs is higher in the cancer patient population.4,5 The majority of

Methods
Registration
The study protocol was prospectively registered to the International
Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (registration number:
CRD42020165672) and was conducted according to the Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)
guidelines (Supplementary material online, Table S1).16 No ethics committee approval or subject informed consent was obtained as this was a
retrospective analysis of already published studies.

Data sources, search strategy, and data
extraction
A systematic review of the literature was performed in Medline, the
Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and the
ClinicalTrials.gov register by two reviewers (J.Al. and P.-M.M.) according
to prespecified selection criteria from inception to 7 April 2020. We
used both controlled terms (i.e. MeSH terms in MEDLINE) and free-text
terms related to ICIs with language restricted to English. Terms related to
ICIs [anti-PD-1 antibodies (nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and cemiplimab),
anti-PD-L1 antibodies (atezolizumab, avelumab, and durvalumab), and
anti-CTLA-4 antibodies (ipilimumab and tremelimumab)] in the title or
abstract (or both) were considered as the sole research domain, and the
search strategy included the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy
for identifying RCTs in Medline.17 Ongoing surveillance was performed
up to 31 August 2020, to identify newly published studies (Medline) or
posted results (ClinicalTrials.gov) that might affect the findings of the review. RCTs including at least one ICI-containing arm (including ICI in
monotherapy, combination of ICI and ICI associated with other anticancer drugs) in adult patients (age >_18 years) with cancer and available
information on CVAEs were eligible for inclusion. Case reports or case
series, case-control studies, observational studies, single-arm studies, and
nonrandomized trials were excluded. We used a comprehensive stepwise method to capture all available CVAE cases. We described this
method previously.18 First, all available CVAEs classified according to the
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) in RCTs on
ICIs reported on ClinicalTrials.gov were extracted.19,20 Second, if
reported CVAEs were not available on ClinicalTrials.gov, all reported
CVAEs were extracted from published RCTs. Last, regarding RCTs for
which we had neither available CVAEs on ClinicalTrials.gov nor available
CVAEs in publications, corresponding authors or sponsors of the study
were contacted by e-mail to provide the required information. We
checked each RCT identified to avoid double counting, and only RCTs
for which CVAEs were available were retained in our final analyses. RCTs

randomized controlled trials (RCTs) studying ICIs underestimated
the risk of cardiovascular (CV) irAEs (i.e. myocarditis, pericarditis,
and vasculitis), which have secondarily emerged as uncommon but
potentially life-threatening AEs.6-8 More recently, several CVAEs (i.e.
myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, Takotsubo syndrome, arrhythmia)9-15 were associated with ICI exposure in postmarketing
surveillance studies. However, these studies only provide a low level
of evidence by design and cannot infer direct causality between ICI
use and CVAEs. Further evidence is mandatory to identify among all
CVAEs reported in ICI RCTs, which CVAEs are at increased risk and
are therefore to be considered as CV irAEs.
The aim of this study was to estimate the risk and incidence of CV
irAEs associated with ICI exposure among all CVAEs reported in
RCTs using a systematic review and a safety meta-analysis.

anticancer drug(s)) vs. controls in RCTs. CVAEs with an increased risk
associated with ICI exposure were considered as CV irAEs. Controls
were classified as placebo or non-placebo. Non-placebo drugs were
defined as any anticancer drug(s) regimen(s) not containing ICIs and
included cytotoxic agents, targeted therapies [including kinase inhibitors,
vascular endothelial growth factor-pathway inhibitors, and related agents
(everolimus)], and other anticancer drug(s). CVAEs of interest were cardiac death or shock, cardiac conductive disorders, cardiac supraventricular arrhythmias, cardiac valve disorders, cardiac ventricular
arrhythmias, cerebral arterial ischaemia, dyslipidemia, endocardial disorders, heart failure (HF), hypertension, myocardial infarction (MI), myocarditis, pericardial diseases, pulmonary hypertension (PH), torsade de
pointe/QT prolongation, and venous thromboembolic events (VTE). All
cases of myocarditis were considered, disregarding their aetiology. We
gathered CVAEs using the MedDRA terminology (see the detailed list of
MedDRA terms in the Supplementary material online, Table S2).
The secondary outcome was the summary incidence of CV irAEs identified in our primary outcome analyses using all RCTs including at least
one ICI arm. A post hoc secondary outcome was the risk of CV irAEs for
ICI combination therapy vs. monotherapy.

Statistical analysis
We performed a random-effects meta-analysis to compute Peto odds
ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), which has been
described as the most accurate method for binary studies with rare
events (<1%) by Morton and colleagues.22 Assuming CV irAEs were not
frequent events (incidence <10%), we interpreted OR as a measure of
the risk.23,24 The incidence of CV irAEs was computed with logit transformation and inverse variance weighting. Prespecified sensitivity analyses

.. of the primary outcome were computed to assess the robustness of the
..
.. results, by recalculating the combined Peto OR after removing (i) each
.. study sequentially, (ii) higher weighted RCTs (which had a weight per.. centage >_75th percentile), (iii) smallest RCTs (which had sample size
..
.. <300 patients), and (iv) RCTs that were judged to be at high risk of bias.
..
We assessed between-study heterogeneity using the inconsistency
..
.. index I2 statistic and the v2 test with its P-value. Substantial between.. study heterogeneity was defined by an I2 value of >50%, and significant
..
.. heterogeneity was defined by a v2 P-value of <0.1017per the Cochrane
.. Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Prespecified sub.. group analyses on ICI regimen, control regimen, and cancer type were
..
.. performed, as well as post hoc analyses on median follow-up (including lin.. ear meta-regression), tobacco use, sex ratio, age, and cancer stage.
.. Additional post hoc measurements using the risk difference (Mantel-
..
.. Haenszel method) and number needed to harm were also computed.
.. Data management and meta-analysis of the pooled data (Peto method)
..
.. were done with R (version 3.5.3) and the R package meta and presented
.. in forest plots. A two-sided P-value of <0.05 in Z-tests (for overall effect)
.. or v2 tests (for overall subgroup comparison) in all analyses was consid..
.. ered statistically significant.

in Table 1. Sixty-three unique RCTs reported between 2010 and
2020 (45 phase 3 RCTs and 18 phase 2 RCTs; 13 placebo-RCTs
and 50 non-placebo-RCTs) with available CVAEs met the predefined criteria. These 63 RCTs were registered with 57 unique identifiers on ClinicalTrials.gov (2 NCTs used for >1 RCT). Nine RCTs
had more than two arms. Risk of bias assessments for each of the
included studies is summarized in Supplementary material online,
Table S4. According to the GRADE scale, the certainty of evidence
was high for all RCTs (Supplementary material online, Table S5).
Among the 63 unique RCTs retrieved, 48 had a control arm and
were therefore used for our primary outcome analyses (risk of
CVAEs associated with ICI exposure). Among these 48 RCTs, 9
RCTs had >2 arms. A total of 29 592 adult patients were enrolled,
of whom 17 199 were in the ICI-containing arms (58.1%) and 12
393 were in the control arms (41.9%). The mean age for the entire
population ranged from 51 to 74 years and the follow-up ranged
from 6.6 to 32.8 months (available in 30). The administered ICIs
(ICI alone, ICI th other anticancer drug(s), other than ICI) were
nivolumab in 25.0%, pembrolizumab in 31.2%, atezolizumab and
durvalumab in 10.4%, ipilimumab in 10.4%, avelumab in 8.3%, and
tremelimumab in 2.1% of the studies. ICI-containing arms were: ICI
in monotherapy alone in 41/48 RCTs, combination of ICI (nivolumab th ipilimumab or durvalumab th tremelimumab) in 5/48, ICI
monotherapy th cytotoxic chemotherapy(ies) in 7/48, ICI monotherapy th targeted therapy(ies) in 3/48, and ICI monotherapy th
another anticancer drug(s) regimen(s) in 1/48. Non-small-cell lung
cancer and melanoma were the most frequent cancer types in
37.5% (18/48) and 10.5% (5/48) of studies, respectively.

As shown in the Graphical abstract and Figure 2, ICIs significantly
increased the risk of 6 CV irAEs including myocarditis (Peto OR:

Discussion
To our knowledge, this study is the first large-scale analysis with an
exhaustive and comprehensive capture of CVAEs in ICI RCTs documenting an increased risk of six individual CV irAEs associated with
ICI therapy. Based on a comprehensive safety meta-analysis, we highlight that ICI therapy increases the risk of myocarditis, dyslipidaemia,
pericardial diseases, HF, cerebral arterial ischaemia, and MI and that
such CV irAEs occur in 3 to 20 per 1000 patients treated by ICIs
during a follow-up ranging from 3.2 to 32.8 months.
Recently, a meta-analysis attempted to address the risk of CV
irAEs associated with ICIs and did not find any increased risk, including for myocarditis,25 but several limitations inherent to the methodology used in this meta-analysis were noticed.26 Having exhaustive
access to RCT safety results is challenging as the published manuscript of efficacy studies in public citation databases often do not
report on rare AEs.27 This difference between efficacy and safety
meta-analysis is critical; therefore, an 'efficacy-like' methodology
applied to a safety meta-analysis appears to be not fully appropriate.27
ClinicalTrials.gov (https://clinicaltrials.gov/, U.S. National Institutes of
Health) is the largest clinical trial register website, holding registrations from over 353 000 trials from 209 countries since 1997.28 In
2008, reporting both efficacy and safety results became mandatory.28
The ClinicalTrials.gov register therefore represents a powerful tool
to study AEs in RCTs and is considered more comprehensive than
the published manuscripts for this objective.20 Agostinetto et al.,25
using a usual 'efficacy-like' approach based only on an extraction of
public citations databases, captured 230 CVAEs associated with ICI
exposure from 66 RCTs (total of 34 664 patients). Using a previously
validated stepwise approach based first on the ClinicalTrials.gov
register,18 we comprehensively captured 419 CVAEs encountering
the same definition as Agostinetto and colleagues from 48 RCTs
(total of 29 592 patients). In addition, the use of the Peto OR method
has been proven to be the most appropriate method to detect rare
events.22
Most attention has been drawn to myocarditis and pericarditis, the
first CV irAEs associated with ICI therapy.6,12,29,30 More recently,
translational and real-life data suggested an increased risk of other
CV irAEs, including HF and MI.9,13-15 A nationwide study in Denmark
showed that patients treated with ICIs had increased rates of CVAEs;
these CVAEs could be delayed from ICI initiation, contrasting with
the early onset of myocarditis and pericarditis.14 Within 6 months

after the first ICI administration, the hazard ratios of CVAEs were
2.14 (95% CI 1.50-3.05) in patients with lung cancer and 4.30 (1.38-
13.42) and 4.93 (2.45-9.94) in patients with malignant melanoma
treated with PD-1 inhibitors and CTLA-4 inhibitors, respectively.
After 6 months, the hazard ratios were 2.26 (1.27-4.02) for patients
with lung cancer and 3.48 (1.91-6.35) for patients with malignant
melanoma and CTLA-4 inhibitors. Similar results were found in a single academic medical centre cohort comparing 2842 ICI patients to
2842 controls matched by age, history of cardiovascular events, and
cancer type.13 In this study, there was a three-fold higher risk for atherosclerotic CV irAEs (defined as MI, coronary revascularization, and
ischaemic stroke) after starting an ICI (hazard ratio 3.3 [95% CI: 2.0-
5.5]; P < 0.001). Recently, some case reports supported by pharmacovigilance data provided convincing elements regarding a plausible
causal association between ICI therapy and MI occurrence.9 In the
present study, we confirm that ICI therapy increases the risk of developing atherosclerotic CV irAEs including both MI and cerebral arterial ischaemia. The progression of atherosclerotic plaque is a robust
predictor and surrogate of atherosclerotic CV irAEs, and it has been
established that dyslipidemia contributes to this progression.31 In our
study, we also found a significant and strong association between ICI
therapy and dyslipidaemia occurrence, which supports the biological
plausibility of our observations between ICI use and atherosclerotic
CV irAEs. Combined with other studies performed in both humans
and animals,13,32 our findings argue for an acceleration in atherosclerosis after ICI introduction through the occurrence of dyslipidemia.
PD-1-deficient myeloid progenitors up-regulate genes involved in
lipid synthesis, mainly cholesterol, and uptake and down-regulate
genes promoting cholesterol metabolism, cumulatively leading to
increased cellular cholesterol levels.33 PD-1 appears to play a critical
role in down-regulating proatherogenic T-cell responses and PD-1
blockade was associated with an exacerbation and acceleration of
atherosclerotic lesions via a significant infiltration of activated
CD4(th) and CD8(th) T cells in genetically modified mice deficient in
both low density lipoprotein receptor and PD-1 (Ldlr(-/-)Pd1(-/-)).34
In addition, aggravated hypercholesterolaemia was observed in
Ldlr(-/-)Pd1(-/-) mice. This accelerated atherogenesis seems to appear quickly after PD-1 blockade with an increase in atherosclerotic
lesions visible as early as 5 weeks in Ldlr(-/-)Pd1(-/-) mice.35
Therefore, it could be interesting to monitor serum lipid levels, especially cholesterol levels, in dedicated ICI patient cohorts to precisely
determine the onset and intensity of these acquired dyslipidemias. In
addition, whether intensive lipid-lowering therapy could decrease
atherosclerotic CV irAEs in ICI-treated patients is unknown. Statin
use was previously associated with reduced progression of atherosclerotic plaque in 40 patients treated by ICI for melanoma who benefitted from computed tomography performed at 3 time points
(annual progression rate of total plaque volume, 5.2% on statins vs.
8.3% not on statins; P = 0.04).13 Dedicated RCTs are warranted to assess the impact of lipid-lowering therapies in patients treated with
ICIs on the risk of atherosclerotic CV irAEs. In our study, it appears
that the risk of dyslipidemia is higher in melanoma RCTs. Several
hypotheses can be raised. Progression free survival is considered better in melanoma compared to other cancer localizations.36 Time to
onset of dyslipidemia is not available in included RCTs but we can hypothesize that longer survival may allow to detect more dyslipidemia.

melanoma were the most frequent cancer types in 28.6% (18/63) and
12.7% (8/63) of studies, respectively.
The incidence of the 6 CV irAEs identified in the primary analysis
was calculated in the 63 RCTs and ranged from 3.2 (95% CI 2.0-5.1,
I2 = 0%) for myocarditis to 19.3 (6.7-54.1, I2 = 92%) for dyslipidemia
per 1000 patients during a follow-up ranging from 3.2 to 32.8 months
(available in 35 studies) (Graphical abstract, Figure 3).

Study limitations
Only reported CVAE cases were analysed in this study, and the
authors acknowledged that these reported cases may not reflect all
CVAEs encountered in clinical practice. Nonserious AE cases are
usually not fully published on reporting websites and only AEs with a
>5% frequency are listed. Some concerns about the inconsistent
reporting of anticancer therapy-associated CVAEs in RCTs have

..
.. been recently raised.44 The absence of individual patient data pre.. cluded time-to-event analysis and reporting. Preexisting traditional
..
.. CV risk factors are usually not reported in oncological RCTs, except
.. the use of tobacco in lung and head and neck cancer RCTs. The pos..
.. sible difference in preexisting traditional CV risk factors between
.. RCTs/cancer localization may influence our incidence analyses.
..
.. Currently, there is no standardized consensus on the choice of sur.. veillance strategies and management algorithms for CVAEs in
..
.. patients participating in oncological RCTs. However, reported AEs
.. represent a consistent definition used worldwide to collect AEs in
..
.. clinical trials that are publicly available on uniform reporting websites
.. and the adoption and adherence to systemic reporting of AEs is
..
.. standard for the evaluation of clinical data.45,46 Therefore, incumbent
.. on these AEs registered on the reporting ClinicalTrials.gov register is
..
.. the rigorous reporting of potentially limiting or impactful AEs to
.. allow informed assessment.47
..
..
..
..
.. Conclusion
..
.. In RCTs, ICI use was associated with an increased risk of myocarditis,
..
.. pericardial disorders, HF, dyslipidaemia, and atherosclerotic CV
.. irAEs (MI and cerebral arterial ischaemia). The incidence of these CV
..
.. irAEs ranged from 3 to 20 per 1000 patients during a median
..
.. follow-up ranging from 3.2 to 32.8 months. These incidences might
.. be underestimated in RCTs as cardiac monitoring is usually minimalist
..
.. in oncologic trials. Clinicians must be aware that ICI use is associated
.. with the occurrence of several CV irAEs, not confined to myocarditis
..
.. and pericarditis. Dyslipidaemia associated with ICI therapy must be
.. explored in dedicated studies and whether lipid-lowering therapy
..
.. could decrease the rate of atherosclerotic CV irAEs in ICI-treated
.. patients must be addressed.

Other cancer localizations such as lung cancer included patients at
higher cardiovascular risk, particularly with a high proportion of tobacco use, that may be already treated with lipid-lowering agents.
Myocarditis is a challenging diagnosis.37-40 Therefore, classification
bias might interfere with the association between HF and ICI exposure we found. Although HF was previously associated with ICI use
with a more delayed time to onset compared to myocarditis,15 it
should be noted that myocarditis often presented as HF symptomatology;12 therefore, HF may be reported as an AE by investigators in
ICI RCTs. Moreover, heterogeneous practices among trial centres
may have led to missing the challenging diagnosis of myocarditis. This
likely results in an underestimation of myocarditis incidence, which
may reduce the association measures in our study (Peto OR). On the
other hand, as all cases of myocarditis were considered disregarding
their aetiology, there might have been cases of nonimmune-related
myocarditis during RCTs; hence, we might have slightly overestimated the incidence of immune-related myocarditis.
Another important finding in our study is the absence of an
increased risk of VTE associated with ICI therapy. Mainly due to the
confounding role of the underlying cancer and the design of studies
(retrospective cohorts), data regarding the risk of VTE associated
with ICI therapy were conflicting.41,42 Regarding arrhythmia occurrence, we also did not find any increased risk. The association between arrhythmias and ICI therapy is debated and appears complex.
Several pharmacovigilance studies found a modest but significant association between supra-ventricular arrythmias and ICI therapy6,43
and it should be noted that a high proportion of cases (>60%) were
co-reported with at least one concomitant irAE or other favouring
AEs.43 Ventricular tachycardias and conduction disorders were previously reported in severe cases of myocarditis, but in ICI-treated
patients these disorders are likely a consequence of myocarditis rather than direct immune reactions.29
Importantly, we computed the incidence for the six CV irAEs identified in our primary analysis. The most frequent CV irAE in our study
was dyslipidemia with an incidence of 19.3 per 1000 patients.
Conversely, myocarditis was the rarest CV irAE with an incidence of
3.2 per 1000 patients, which is in line with previous reports.8,29
Interestingly, cerebral arterial ischaemia, HF and MI were 2-3 times
more frequent than myocarditis. In a recent evaluation of pivotal clinical trials supporting the Food and Drug Administration approval of
contemporary anticancer therapies, 37% of immunotherapy trials did
not report any CVAEs in follow-up, as did 54% of skin and 37% of
lung cancer trials.44 Moreover, in trials reporting CVAEs, the noted
rates of AEs were markedly lower than those observed among reallife populations.44 These findings suggest a general underreporting
and/or appreciation of CVAEs among cancer RCT participants that
may affect our results, especially incidence computations and the
authors hypothesized that our incidence findings in RCTs might be
underestimated and not reflect real-life incidence.
