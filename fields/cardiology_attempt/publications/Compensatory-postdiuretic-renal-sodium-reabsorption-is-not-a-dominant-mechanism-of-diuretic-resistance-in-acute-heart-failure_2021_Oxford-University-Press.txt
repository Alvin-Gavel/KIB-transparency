Aims

In healthy volunteers, the kidney deploys compensatory post-diuretic sodium reabsorption (CPDSR) following loop
diuretic-induced natriuresis, minimizing sodium excretion and producing a neutral sodium balance. CPDSR is
extrapolated to non-euvolemic populations as a diuretic resistance mechanism; however, its importance in acute
decompensated heart failure (ADHF) is unknown.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
Patients with ADHF in the Mechanisms of Diuretic Resistance cohort receiving intravenous loop diuretics (462
and results
administrations in 285 patients) underwent supervised urine collections entailing an immediate pre-diuretic spot
urine sample, then 6-h (diuretic-induced natriuresis period) and 18-h (post-diuretic period) urine collections. The
average spot urine sodium concentration immediately prior to diuretic administration [median 15 h (13-17) after
last diuretic] was 64 +/- 33 mmol/L with only 4% of patients having low (<20 mmol/L) urine sodium consistent with
CPDSR. Paradoxically, greater 6-h diuretic-induced natriuresis was associated with larger 18-h post-diuretic spontaneous natriuresis (r = 0.7, P < 0.001). Higher pre-diuretic urine sodium to creatinine ratio (r = 0.37, P < 0.001) was
the strongest predictor of post-diuretic spontaneous natriuresis. In a subgroup of patients (n = 43) randomized to
protocol-driven intensified diuretic therapies, the mean diuretic-induced natriuresis increased three-fold. In contrast
to the substantial decrease in spontaneous natriuresis predicted by CPDSR, no change in post-diuretic spontaneous
natriuresis was observed (P = 0.47).

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
On a population level, CPDSR was not an important driver of diuretic resistance in hypervolemic ADHF. Contrary
to CPDSR, a greater diuretic-induced natriuresis predicted a larger post-diuretic spontaneous natriuresis. Basal
sodium avidity, rather than diuretic-induced CPDSR, appears to be the predominant determinate of both diureticinduced and post-diuretic natriuresis in hypervolemic ADHF.

Introduction
Diuretic resistance in acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) is
common and associated with worse outcomes.1-4 Compensatory
post-diuretic sodium reabsorption (CPDSR) is ubiquitously cited as a
cause of diuretic resistance in ADHF.1,5-14 More accurately, CPDSR
is a mechanism by which, despite an adequate acute diuretic response, patients fail to achieve a negative sodium/fluid balance secondary to an equal amount of compensatory/rebound sodium
reabsorption in the post-diuretic period.1,5,7 After the loop diuretic
concentration decreases below the diuretic threshold, the concept
of CPDSR asserts that the kidneys decrease urinary sodium excretion
to very low levels over the following hours to counterbalance the
diuretic-induced natriuresis (Figure 1). Therefore, an increase in diuretic response produces an increased CPDSR response, resulting in a
neutral 24-h sodium balance. This paradigm arose from research in
euvolemic, healthy volunteers and has been extrapolated to patients
with ADHF.7,15-19 However, CPDSR has not been studied in contemporary hypervolemic ADHF populations and the failure of therapies such as loop diuretic infusion to improve decongestion raises the
question if this physiology is operative in patients with ADHF.20 Our
primary objective was to better understand the importance of
CPDSR in contemporary hypervolemic ADHF.

Methods
Patients admitted with ADHF to the cardiology service at Yale New
Haven Hospital who required treatment with intravenous (IV) loop diuretics (furosemide or bumetanide) were screened for inclusion in the
Mechanisms of Diuretic Resistance (MDR) study (NCT02546583). Full
study methods have been published previously.21 Briefly, the MDR study
was designed to investigate mechanisms of diuretic resistance in a prospective cohort hospitalized with ADHF. The relevance of CPDSR as a diuretic resistance mechanism was an a priori study question, and study
methods were designed to investigate CPDSR.21 Patients are followed
longitudinally with study visits occurring at several diuretic milestones
within the ADHF hospital episode to investigate early and later IV loop diuretic doses. Patients exhibiting diuretic resistance are enrolled in a
randomized sub-study comparing increased loop diuretic doses to combination diuretic therapy with chlorothiazide.
The key inclusion criteria were (i) use of intermittent IV loop diuretic
therapy with projected need of IV diuretics for at least 3 days, (ii) a goal of
significant fluid removal (>1 L net fluid loss/day), and (iii) at least one objective sign of volume overload. Key exclusion criteria were significant
bladder dysfunction, urinary incontinence, and inability to comply with
urine collection procedures. We excluded patients for this analysis of the
MDR study cohort that received a thiazide within 24 h of the analysis periods or did not receive a loop diuretic dose prior to the urine collections
utilized for post-diuretic assessments. Patients received a 3 g (130 mmol)

absorption. The concept of compensatory post-diuretic sodium
reabsorption is illustrated by graphing hypothetical urinary sodium
excretion over a 48-h period divided into 6-h blocks. A 24-h pre-diuretic period (blue bars) is followed by a 6-h natriuretic period
from an IV loop diuretic dose in the red bar and subsequent 18-h
post-diuretic period (blue bars). The horizontal dotted black line
denotes the average rate of urinary sodium excretion needed every
6 h (31 mmol/6 h) to achieve a net even 24-h sodium balance, where
dietary sodium intake (130 mmol) equals urinary sodium excretion
(95% of intake = 124 mmol) plus insensible sodium losses (6 mmol).
In the pre-diuretic period, the urinary sodium excretion rate equals
the sodium intake. The diagonally hashed portion of the red LD bar
above the dotted line represents the quantity of natriuresis exceeding the expected rate from dietary intake. In the post-diuretic
period, the diagonally hashed blue space indicates the amount of
post-diuretic sodium reabsorption, where urinary sodium excretion
is depressed following a diuretic period. The concept of compensatory post-diuretic sodium reabsorption asserts the red diagonally hashed
area of excess natriuresis will trigger a compensatory post-diuretic sodium reabsorption of equal magnitude, resulting in a net even sodium
balance.

per day sodium restricted diet. IV diuretic dose was determined by the
treating physician. Enrollment could occur at any point during the hospitalization provided the patient met all inclusion and exclusion criteria. All
patients provided written informed consent, and the study was approved
by the Yale Institutional Review Board.

Study visit protocol
During the post-diuretic period from a prior loop diuretic dose and prior
to the morning diuretic dose (Hour 0), a blood sample was obtained,
patients were asked to completely empty their bladder, from which a
baseline urine sample was obtained, and a bladder scan was performed to
quantitate residual volume in the bladder. Following loop diuretic administration, a timed 6-h urine collection with intensive supervision by study

.. staff was performed to ensure all urine was collected. After 6 h, patients
..
.. were asked to empty their bladder to complete the urine collection and a
.. bladder scan was repeated. Participants then underwent an 18-h timed
..
.. urine collection (to complete 24 h) which was conducted by the clinical
.. nursing staff. Study visits could be repeated on subsequent hospital days
..
.. during IV diuretic therapy.

MDR Study Cohort: Within the MDR study, we examined a Calculated

The Measured Cohort serves as the primary cohort and consists of

Validation of the calculated 18-h spontaneous natriuresis equation

The Randomized Intervention Cohort measures the intra-patient change
in the post-diuretic spontaneous natriuresis following a randomized intervention to increase diuretic-induced natriuresis. Patients with poor diuretic response at the first study visit (6-h cumulative sodium excretion
<100 mmol) were included in a randomized, controlled study visit the following day to investigate different diuretic strategies to increase natriuresis. Patients were randomized to either 2.5 X the previous IV loop
diuretic or the same IV loop diuretic dose plus IV chlorothiazide as a part
of an unrelated study to compare diuretic strategies in diuretic resistance.21 The Randomized Intervention Cohort provides insight into the mechanisms of post-diuretic spontaneous natriuresis by measuring how
increased diuretic-induced natriuresis impacts CPDSR and the basal sodium avidity (proclivity of the kidney to excessively retain sodium) independent of diuretic response.

Measurements of natriuresis
For diuretic-induced natriuresis, we defined the 6-h percent expected natriuresis as the percentage of the ADHF patient's 6-h cumulative sodium
output after a diuretic relative to the mean 6-h cumulative sodium output
from the Healthy Volunteer Cohort. Diuretic efficiency is expressed as the
cumulative 6-h urine sodium excreted per doubling of the diuretic dose
as previously described.23

Results
Healthy Volunteer Cohort
The Healthy Volunteer Cohort had a mean age of 26 +/- 5 years (90%
white, 50% male) and a mean weight of 74 +/- 13 kg. In the 24 h prior
to diuretic therapy, volunteers excreted 149 +/- 65 mmol of sodium.
Following IV furosemide 40 mg, the mean 6-h sodium excretion was
199 +/- 49 mmol. Despite provision and encouragement of the consumption of high sodium foods and fluid intake, the mean cumulative
spontaneous natriuresis was only 50 +/- 23 mmol total over the subsequent 18 h (Supplementary material online, Figure S3). These results
replicate prior observations in non-heart failure populations, indicating that CPDSR had a dominant effect on urine sodium excretion following an acute loop diuretic administration.

ADHF Measured Cohort
Spot urine sodium concentration
The baseline characteristics of the Measured Cohort are provided in
Table 1 and Supplementary material online, Table S1. Their mean spot
urine sodium concentrations prior to the subsequent diuretic dose at
Hour 0 fmedian time 14.7 h [interquartile range (IQR) 13.2-17.0]
from the last diuretic doseg was 64 +/- 33 mmol/L and displayed wide
variability (Figure 3). Only 4% of patients had a spot urine sodium concentration <20 mmol/L. The baseline characteristics (Supplementary
material online, Table S2) and spot urine sodium concentration
(mean 62 +/- 30 mmol/L) were similar in the Calculated Cohort
(Supplementary material online, Figure S4).
Relationship between diuretic response and post-diuretic
spontaneous natriuresis
We assessed the relationship between the 6-h diuretic-induced natriuresis and the following 18-h post-diuretic spontaneous natriuresis in
the Measured Cohort (Figure 4). The mean 6-h diuretic-induced cumulative sodium excretion was 122 +/- 90 mmol. The ensuing mean 18-h
post-diuretic spontaneous natriuresis was 104 +/- 109 mmol, similar to
the expected 93 mmol based on dietary intake and counter to the
paradigm of CPDSR (P = 0.28, Figure 4A). The post-void urine volume

in the bladder was 63 (IQR 14-134) mL at the end of the 6-h urine
collection and start of the 18-h urine collection. Patients with a negative 24-h sodium balance had both a greater mean diuretic-induced
natriuresis (158 +/- 87 mmol) and subsequent post-diuretic spontaneous natriuresis (138 +/- 116 mmol) compared to patients with a positive sodium balance, who had a poor diuretic-induced natriuresis
(mean 44 +/- 33 mmol) followed by a low post-diuretic spontaneous
natriuresis (30 +/- 18 mmol) (P < 0.0001 for both comparisons) (Figure
4B). These observations were congruent in the Calculated Cohort and
when analysed in a sensitivity analysis 'per patient' (Supplementary
material online, Table S3).
When the urine sodium excretions were analysed as percentages of
the expected natriuresis, the mean diuretic-induced natriuresis was
61 +/- 45% of expected; however, the post-diuretic spontaneous natriuresis exceeded the expected amount (111 +/- 116%) (Supplementary
material online, Figure S5). Consistent with an overall sodium avid
state, those with a positive 24-h sodium balance had both severely
depressed diuretic-induced natriuresis (22 +/- 11% of expected) and
reduced post-diuretic spontaneous natriuresis (32 +/- 20% of
expected). Paradoxically, greater 6-h diuretic-induced natriuresis was
associated with larger 18-h post-diuretic spontaneous natriuresis
(r = 0.7, P < 0.001). Across increasing deciles of diuretic-induced
natriuresis, the subsequent post-diuretic spontaneous natriuresis
increased consistently (P < 0.001) (Figure 5). Similar observations
were found in the Calculated Cohort (Supplementary material online,
Figure S6).
Variables associated with post-diuretic spontaneous
natriuresis
Within the Measured Cohort, we assessed the 18-h post-diuretic
spontaneous natriuresis relative to pre-diuretic and diuretic variables
to ascertain the drivers of post-diuretic spontaneous natriuresis
(Table 2). Neither estimated glomerular filtration rate (P = 0.26) nor
blood urea nitrogen (P = 0.89) were associated with post-diuretic
spontaneous natriuresis. Indicators of basal sodium avidity prior to
the diuretic dose were associated with post-diuretic spontaneous
natriuresis, including the pre-diuretic urine sodium concentration
(r = 0.30, P < 0.001) and the urine sodium/creatinine ratio (r = 0.37,
P < 0.001). Similar observations were found in the Calculated Cohort
(Supplementary material online, Table S4).
Effect of increasing diuretic response on post-diuretic
spontaneous natriuresis
While the cross-sectional observations above suggest CPDSR is not
a primary determinant of sodium excretion on a population level in
ADHF, they do not address if CPDSR is relevant in poor diuretic responders forced to have an adequate acute natriuretic response with
escalation of diuretic therapies. To assess the intra-patient change in
post-diuretic spontaneous natriuresis following increased diuretic intensity and diuretic-induced natriuresis, patients in the Randomized
Intervention Cohort (n = 43) received either an increased IV loop diuretic dose (n = 18) or IV loop with IV chlorothiazide (n = 25). Baseline
characteristic are presented in Supplementary material online, Table
S5. The 6-h diuretic-induced natriuresis increased in 65% of patients
from a mean 6-h urine sodium excretion of 55 +/- 24 to 155 +/- 95 mmol
(Figure 6). Despite a three-fold increase in diuretic-induced

distribution, respectively. Categorical variables were compared with the
chi-squared test. For comparisons between loop diuretic administrations,
which were repeated observations, we accounted for the absence of independence of observations with linear mixed models. We analysed the
distribution in 18-h spontaneous natriuresis by deciles of 6-h natriuresis.
We also aimed to analyse linear trends of continuous variables across
groups of 18-h natriuresis; thus, we used linear mixed models.
Associations between continuous variables were analysed with linear
mixed models, and the correlations were displayed as the squared root
of the R2. The 18-h post-diuretic spontaneous natriuresis was compared
against an expected mean of 93 mmol with a one sample t-test. In the
randomized intervention cohort, we included unique patients; the comparison between the 18-h natriuresis during the first visit and the 18-h
natriuresis during the intervention was done with a paired t-test. A
detailed description of the statistical tests used in the manuscript is found
in the Supplementary material online. Statistical significance was defined
as 2-tailed P < 0.05. Statistical analysis was performed with IBM SPSS
Statistics version 26 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY) and Stata SE version 14.0
(StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).

natriuresis did not change significantly from 46 +/- 47 to 54 +/- 50 mmol
(P = 0.47), in contrast to the substantial decrease the CPDSR paradigm would predict.

Discussion
In contrast to the prevailing wisdom, the primary observation in this
study is that, on a population level, CPDSR did not appear to be a
meaningful contributor of diuretic resistance in hypervolemic ADHF.
In contrast, we observed that larger diuretic-induced natriuresis was
actually followed by greater spontaneous natriuresis in the postdiuretic period, the inverse pattern predicted by CPDSR. Even with
protocol-driven intensified diuretic therapy, which resulted in a
three-fold increase in diuretic-induced natriuresis, we found no

change in post-diuretic spontaneous natriuresis. Overall, these findings indicate that, in the volume expanded setting of ADHF, CPDSR
is not a relevant mechanism leading to blunted renal sodium excretion at the population level. Rather, a basal and relatively fixed degree
of sodium avidity (proclivity of the kidney to excessively retain
sodium) intrinsic to each patient appears to drive both the diureticinduced and post-diuretic spontaneous natriuresis (Graphical
abstract).
The concept of CPDSR was established in healthy volunteers on a
high sodium diet7 and has been extrapolated to be a significant mechanism of diuretic resistance in ADHF. While often simplified as only
compensatory to the preceding diuresis, both volume-dependent
and volume-independent mechanisms cause intense compensatory
renal sodium retention in the post-diuretic period.9,10,18 Although
the expanded extracellular volume in patients with ADHF may eliminate volume-dependent CPDSR mechanisms, mechanisms

patients had a urine sodium concentration below this threshold during spontaneous natriuresis in the post-diuretic period.

independent of volume and diuretic therapy can determine basal sodium avidity and therefore post-diuretic sodium excretion.9,30
According to the traditional paradigm, CPDSR can be eliminated and
decongestion significantly improved by provision of a very low-sodium diet, diminishing available sodium for the kidney to reabsorb, or
continuous infusion of loop diuretic.6 However, a multitude of studies have demonstrated a lack of meaningful increase in decongestion
with continuous infusion relative to bolus dosing at an equivalent
total daily dose.11,20,31 Furthermore, randomization to intense sodium restriction (0.8 g/day) during ADHF did not improve weight
loss, decongestion, or time to oral diuretic transition compared to an
unrestricted sodium intake (3-5 g/day).32 Our findings provide a
mechanism to explain why these strategies did not result in measurable clinical improvement in hypervolemic ADHF populations. As
profound differences in renal sodium handling exist between patients
with and without heart failure, historically accepted diuretic concepts
founded in euvolemic healthy controls and hypertensive patients
need to be validated in ADHF populations.
The global observation in this study is that post-diuretic spontaneous natriuresis was positively correlated to the amount of diureticinduced natriuresis (i.e. opposite of the CPDSR concept), providing
strong evidence that there is not a robust renal compensation to
diuretic-induced sodium losses in volume expanded ADHF. Among
these study observations, the most compelling CPDSR refutation is
the lack of intra-patient change in post-diuretic spontaneous natriuresis following diuretic therapy escalation in patients with a poor initial diuretic response. Despite an aggressive diuretic intervention
resulting in a three-fold increase in diuretic-induced natriuresis, there
was no change in post-diuretic spontaneous natriuresis. Presumably
patients had similar basal sodium avidity on both days, but via

substantial diuretic escalation (addition of 500 mg IV chlorothiazide
or 2.5  the loop dose) we were able achieve an adequate acute diuretic response. However, consistent with post-diuretic natriuresis
dependence on the basal intrinsic sodium avidity of the patient, the
post-diuretic spontaneous natriuresis did not increase or decrease.
These data suggest that the most effective strategies to improve
decongestion in ADHF would focus on modulating the basal sodium
avidity substrate of the patient, which could improve both diuretic response and spontaneous natriuresis. However, an important observation is that even in a high disease severity tertiary referral center
population such as this, the sodium avidity physiology was quite variable and many patients did not have high basal avidity. To that end,
two-thirds of the Measured Cohort was able to achieve a negative sodium balance with only once daily and relatively low-dose loop diuretic therapy. There has been a multitude of 'failed' cardio-renal
therapeutics in ADHF populations such as nesiritide, ularitide, lowdose dopamine, and high-dose spironolactone.33-36 Many of these
interventions would not be expected to provide measurable benefit
in patients without significant sodium avidity. The current findings indicate this substrate is not present in all ADHF patients and raises the
question if some of these 'failed' therapies may in fact have significant
value in selected populations with high basal sodium avidity.33,34,37
Our findings have important implications for the care of patients
with ADHF. Heart failure guidelines state frequent/short interval diuretic dosing or continuous infusions may be needed as sodium reabsorption will occur once the tubular concentration of diuretics
decline.6 However, we found in many patients a good diuretic response was followed by correspondingly good spontaneous natriuresis that ultimately contributed meaningfully to achieving a negative
sodium balance. Notably, in the measured cohort almost equal quantities of the total sodium excretion occurred in the 18-h post-diuretic
period as the 6-h diuretic period. As such, patients with a good
diuretic-induced natriuretic response will often continue to have significant natriuresis in the post-diuretic period. These patients may be
ideally treated with once or twice daily IV loop diuretic dosing which
will avoid unnecessary diuretic exposure.
However, patients with a poor acute diuretic response are in double jeopardy with limited sodium excretion in the post-diuretic
period. Although we found that substantially increasing diuretic intensity rectified the diuretic-induced natriuresis, the subsequent spontaneous natriuresis remained low. Given the ceiling of sodium
excretion with a single dose of diuretic, diuretic resistant patients
need both higher doses and also more frequent dosing/continuous
infusion of those higher doses. Importantly, continuous infusion has
not shown meaningful superiority over bolus diuretic administration
when administered at equivalent total daily doses.20 However, the
use of a significantly higher total daily loop diuretic dose administered
as an infusion, could theoretically be the preferred strategy for
patients with a highly sodium avid substrate. Thus, patients with significant diuretic resistance may be optimally treated with both higher
diuretic doses and frequent dosing/continuous infusion, not because
of CPDSR but due to high basal sodium avidity.
Several limitations warrant discussion. The gold standard approach
to performing sodium balance studies is to confine participants in a
metabolic ward and provide a precise metabolic diet with well quantitated sodium content. This is obviously not feasible in a large ADHF
study of real-world hospitalized patients. Rather, we constructed

with the corresponding 18-h spontaneous cumulative urine sodium
excretion (mean +/- SEM) on the y-axis. Contrary to the paradigm of
compensatory post-diuretic sodium reabsorption, greater diureticinduced natriuresis was associated with higher post-diuretic spontaneous natriuresis (P < 0.001).

Figure 6 Influence of increased diuretic-induced natriuresis on

Cohort, the initial poor diuretic response (first red bar) was followed
by poor 18-h spontaneous natriuresis (blue bars), plotted as
mean +/- SEM. The 18-h spontaneous natriuresis is shown evenly distributed across three 6-h bars, producing identical means and standard errors. Following an intensified diuretic regimen the following
day, the diuretic-induced natriuresis increased (second red bar) and
the subsequent post-diuretic spontaneous natriuresis did not decrease due to CPDSR but instead increased slightly with increasing
diuretic-induced natriuresis.

two cohorts to buttress each cohort's limitations in ascertaining sodium balance. The Measured Cohort is devoid of the calculated
assumptions of the Calculated Cohort but is limited by potential selection bias from including patients who only received once daily IV loop
diuretics, missing urine voids during the 18-h urine collection

.. performed by clinical nursing staff, and the diuretic effect potentially
.. continuing into the post-diuretic period. The Calculated Cohort lacks

.. these limitations but has limitations arising from calculation assump.. tions. The limitations of the Measured and Calculated cohorts are miti..

.. cohort were mutually reinforcing. Both cohorts are from two hospi.. tals in a tertiary care medical center which could introduce selection
