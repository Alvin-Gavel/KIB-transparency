J. Bosch et al.

Aims

Rosuvastatin (10 mg per day) compared with placebo reduced major adverse cardiovascular (CV) events by 24% in
12 705 participants at intermediate CV risk after 5.6 years. There was no benefit of blood pressure (BP) lowering
treatment in the overall group, but a reduction in events in the third of participants with elevated systolic BP.
After cessation of all the trial medications, we examined whether the benefits observed during the active treatment
phase were sustained, enhanced, or attenuated.

Conclusion
The CV benefits of rosuvastatin, and BP lowering in those with elevated systolic BP, compared with placebo con-

a reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) or blood

of myocardial infarction, stroke, or CV death [major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE)-1], and the second was
MACE-1 plus resuscitated cardiac arrest, heart failure, or coronary revascularization (MACE-2). In total, 9326
(78%) of 11 994 surviving Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE)-3 subjects consented to participate in
extended follow-up. During 3.1 years of post-trial observation (total follow-up of 8.7 years), participants originally
randomized to rosuvastatin compared with placebo had a 20% additional reduction in MACE-1 [95% confidence
interval (CI), 0.64-0.99] and a 17% additional reduction in MACE-2 (95% CI 0.68-1.01). Therefore, over the 8.7
years of follow-up, there was a 21% reduction in MACE-1 (95% CI 0.69-0.90, P = 0.005) and 21% reduction in
MACE-2 (95% CI 0.69-0.89, P = 0.002). There was no benefit of BP lowering in the overall study either during the
active or post-trial observation period, however, a 24% reduction in MACE-1 was observed over 8.7 years.

Lowering cholesterol, blood pressure or both to prevent cardiovascular events

Methods
The methods of the main trial have previously been reported in detail.2
Briefly, men aged >_55 years and women aged >_65 years were enrolled if
they had one CV risk factor; women who were between 60 and 65 years
were eligible if they had two risk factors. Risk factors included elevated
waist-to-hip ratio (>_0.85 in women, >_0.90 in men), current smoking,
impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, or diabetes requiring only diet control, estimated glomerular filtration rate between 45 and
60 mL/min/1.73 m2, or a family history of premature heart disease in firstdegree relatives (<65 years in women or <55 years in men). Participants
were excluded if in the opinion of the treating physician, they needed or
had contraindications to study medications or had previous CVD.
Eligible participants who provided consent entered a single-blind runin phase where they received rosuvastatin 10 mg daily and candesartan
16 mg plus hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg as a combination pill. If adherent
to study drugs, participants were centrally randomized to the active
phase to receive rosuvastatin 10 mg daily or placebo and candesartan
16 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg daily or placebo. They were seen

6 weeks later and then every 6 months. Data were collected on adherence, adverse events and outcomes, and participants had their BP and
heart rate measured annually. Counselling on diet and other lifestyle
behaviours were provided at every visit. At the end of the active phase, all
blinded study medications were stopped, and participants were asked to
follow-up with their usual care physician who were free to determine appropriate treatment for each individual. Those who were alive at the end
of the active intervention phase, and consented to long-term follow-up,
were included irrespective of their lipid or BP levels or whether or not
they had a MACE during the active phase of the trial. Participants were
contacted annually and data on CV events, mortality, and medications
were recorded using the same processes and definitions as those used in
the active phase (Supplementary material online, Figure S1).
The HOPE-3 study was conducted in 228 centres in 21 countries.
Each participant provided written informed consent for the active phase
of the study and, if alive at the end of the active phase, they were asked to
provide consent for passive follow-up. Ethics and regulatory approvals
were obtained to conduct the study at each site and in each country.
During the passive follow-up, use of lipid- and BP-lowering medications
was at the discretion of each participant's physician(s) responsible for his/
her clinical care.
There were two co-primary study outcomes in both the active and
passive follow-up phases: myocardial infarction, stroke, or death due to
CV causes (MACE-1), and MACE-1 plus resuscitated cardiac arrest, heart
failure, or coronary revascularization (MACE-2). Secondary outcomes
for the BP-lowering arm were MACE-2 plus angina with objective evidence of ischaemia, and stroke. Because rosuvastatin had the largest
effects on coronary ischaemic events during the active treatment phase
of the study, as a post hoc analysis for the passive follow-up, we explored
the effects on these events (fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, angina, and revascularization). Pre-specified subgroups were defined by sex, age, LDL-C, baseline BP, and ethnicity.
Participants were asked about the occurrence of study outcomes at each
visit during the active and passive follow-up phases. We also recorded
use of key medications during follow-up (statins and BP-lowering agents).
If patients reported that outcomes occurred, investigators were
requested to provide supporting documentation but events were not
adjudicated during the passive follow-up.
Data were censored at the time of death or last available follow-up
and were analysed according to the original allocations for each treatment (intention to treat). Descriptive statistics were used to present
baseline characteristics [means and standard deviations, medians and
interquartile ranges (IQR)]. Hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence
intervals (CI) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models
stratified according to the other treatment. Outcomes from randomization to the end of the passive follow-up period were included after censoring participants who did not experience the event of interest at their
last contact date or if a non-CV death had occurred. Proportional hazards
for first events were calculated separately for the active and passive phase
(i.e. events during the passive phase were considered first events regardless of whether a previous event occurred during the active phase).
The HR for total follow-up included only first events over the entire follow-up period. Hazard ratios for recurrent events were analysed using a
proportional means model.9 Incidence of outcomes over time was calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. To determine whether there were any
biases introduced by selective participation in the passive follow-up
phase, a sensitivity analysis was performed using data from centres where
at least 80% of the eligible participants continued in the passive follow-up
phase. A cumulative incidence function analysis10 was also done to determine the impact of non-CV deaths as competing risks on the MACE-1
outcome.

including myocardial infarction, stroke, or death from CV causes) by
24%.3 Despite reducing systolic BP by 6 mmHg, the combination of
candesartan (16 mg daily) and hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg daily)
compared with placebo did not reduce MACE significantly in the
overall trial population. However, a significant reduction in CVD was
reported in participants in the upper third of baseline BP [systolic BP
>143 mmHg (mean 154 mmHg)].4 Importantly, HOPE-3 included a
substantial proportion of non-Caucasians among whom prior data
on preventive therapies are limited.
It is possible that the results observed during the period of active
treatment may not capture the longer-term effects of treatments.5
Both statins and BP lowering may cause structural changes in the vasculature, such as alterations of plaque morphology and composition
that may lead to continued or enhanced benefits during further observation.6-8 We hypothesized that even after cessation of active
study treatment, the benefits of statins, and of BP lowering in those
with elevated BP, would be preserved or enhanced for some years,
and that late benefits from BP lowering might also emerge.
Documenting the long-term effects of preventive strategies is both
of public health and clinical importance for patients, prescribers, funders, and policymakers when making decisions about use of medications. Whilst it is theoretically desirable to conduct randomized trials
of prevention strategies over prolonged periods to determine the
'full' effects of treatments, this might take 10-15 years of intervention,
and such prolonged trials are impractical. Instead, documenting
events after the cessation of active treatments may provide some
useful indicators of whether late benefits from treatments exist. In
the HOPE-3 trial, we reported a significant reduction in CVD with
rosuvastatin during the active phase of 5.6 years, whereas the benefits
of BP lowering were confined to those with elevated BP at baseline.
Subsequently, in this passive extended follow-up of HOPE-3 participants, where participants previously receiving study drug were no
longer doing so, we aimed to determine whether (i) the benefits
observed with rosuvastatin during the active treatment period were
sustained, enhanced, or attenuated and (ii) delayed benefits would
emerge in the group randomized to BP lowering compared with
placebo.

Results
Recruitment into HOPE-3 began in May 2007 and was completed in
November 2010. Participants continued on active treatment until
December 2015 (median 5.6 years of follow-up) at which point passive follow-up began and continued until December 2018 for a combined median length of follow-up of 8.7 years (IQR 8.1-9.3 years). Of
the original 228 centres, 166 (with a total of 9326 participants)
agreed to participate in the passive follow-up. Of these 166 centres,
149 centres recruited at least 80% of eligible participants for the passive follow-up phase. Of 12 705 participants randomized, 11 994

were eligible for passive follow-up, 9326 (78%) consented to participate, and 97% were followed for 3 years (Figure 1).
Baseline characteristics were similar between those who agreed
to continue in passive follow-up and the overall population
(Supplementary material online, Table S1). There were no additional
BP or lipid measurements after the end of active follow-up, as visits
were completed by telephone. One year after completing the active
phase of the study, 37% of participants were prescribed a statin
(36% of those randomized to rosuvastatin and 38% of those
randomized to placebo), and 25% were taking two or more BP-lowering drugs, which was similar in the randomized groups. During the
extended follow-up period, statin use stayed the same over 3 years,
while use of two or more BP lowering drugs increased to 30% by
the 3rd year of follow-up (with no differences between randomized
groups).

During the passive follow-up phase, patients originally randomized to
BP lowering compared with placebo did not demonstrate a significant
reduction in any of the primary or secondary outcomes (Table 1).

Passive follow-up over 3.1 years: blood
pressure lowering th rosuvastatin vs.
double placebo
During the passive follow-up phase, those originally randomized to
the combination of rosuvastatin and BP lowering compared with
those randomized to double placebo had a 15% reduction in MACE1, which was similar to the benefits from rosuvastatin alone.
However, given that this was based on fewer individuals, this difference was not statistically significant [70 events (3.0%) in those on
combination therapy vs. 82 events (3.5%) in those on placebo; HR
0.85, 95% CI 0.62-1.17, P = 0.32]. Similar results were seen for
MACE-2 and MACE-2 plus angina, while there was a significant reduction (54%) in coronary ischaemic events (Table 1).

Complete follow-up over 8.7 years:
rosuvastatin vs. placebo
During 8.7 years of follow-up (5.6 years of active intervention plus
3.1 years of passive follow-up), patients originally randomized to
rosuvastatin compared with placebo had a 21% reduction in MACE-1
[378 (5.9%) in those on rosuvastatin vs. 472 (7.4%) in those on placebo; HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.69-0.90, P = 0.0005] (Figure 2A). Similar
results were seen for the MACE-2, MACE-2 plus angina, and coronary ischaemic events (Table 1), and for recurrent events for MACE-1
(HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.67-0.89, P = 0.0003).

Complete follow-up over 8.7 years: blood
pressure lowering vs. placebo
During the entire length of follow-up, patients originally randomized
to BP lowering compared with placebo did not have a significant reduction in MACE-1 [419 (6.6%) events in those on BP lowering vs.
431 (6.8%) in those on placebo; HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.85-1.11, P = 0.67]
(Figure 2B). There was also no effect on MACE-2, MACE-2 plus angina, or coronary ischaemic outcomes (Table 1). A recurrent event

analyses for all components of MACE-1 also indicated little benefit
(HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.83-1.10, P = 0.67).

Complete follow-up over 8.7 years: blood
pressure lowering th rosuvastatin vs.
double placebo
Among patients originally randomized to both BP lowering and rosuvastatin compared with double placebo, there was a 24% reduction
in MACE-1 [181 (5.7%) vs. 234 (7.4%); HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.63-0.92,
P = 0.006] (Figure 2C). Similar results were seen for MACE-2 and
MACE-2 plus angina, and for recurrent events for MACE-1 (HR 0.73,
95% CI 0.60-0.90, P = 0.002). There was also a 37% reduction in coronary ischaemic events (2.0% vs. 3.2%; HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.46-0.86,
P = 0.004) (Table 1).
Similar results for all comparisons were seen in sensitivity analyses restricted to those centres who followed 80% or more of their
participants in the passive phase (Supplementary material online,
Table S2) as well as using a competing risk analysis for non-CV
deaths.

Subgroup and landmark analyses
After 8.7 years, the benefits of rosuvastatin were consistent across
pre-specified subgroups regardless of baseline LDL-C level, CV risk,
age, ethnicity, and sex (Figure 3). Blood pressure lowering benefitted
those with the highest third of baseline systolic BP (>143 mmHg)
during the 8.7 years of passive follow-up.
During the active intervention phase, there was a 24% risk reduction in MACE-1 (95% CI 0.62-0.96) for those with the highest baseline systolic BP, whereas no benefit was observed in those in the
lower two tertiles of baseline systolic BP (<_143 mmHg) (P for interaction = 0.009). During the passive follow-up, there was a 17% nonsignificant reduction in MACE-1 for those with the highest baseline
systolic BP and no benefit for those in the lower tertiles (Table 2).
Over 8.7 years, there was a 24% reduction in MACE-1 for those with
the highest baseline systolic BP (95% CI 0.62-0.94) and no benefit for
those in the lower tertiles of baseline systolic BP (Table 2, Figure 4).
For the combination therapy compared with double placebo, those
with the highest third of baseline BP on double active therapy had a
39% lower risk of MACE-1 during passive follow-up (HR 0.61, 95%
CI 0.45-0.82) and a 24% risk reduction during 8.7 years of follow-up
(95% CI 0.62-0.96, P for trend = 0.249).
Landmark analyses, using 3-year intervals, demonstrated that those
taking rosuvastatin had a 16% reduction in MACE-1 in the first 3 years
(95% CI 0.65-1.08), a 23% risk reduction in years 3-6 (95% CI 0.62-
0.97) and a 24% reduction beyond 6 years (95% CI 0.61-0.95). For
those on combination therapy, there was a 22%, 28%, and 21% reduction over the same time intervals (Supplementary material online,
Table S3).

Discussion
During an additional 3.1 years of passive follow-up of HOPE-3 study
participants without CVD but at intermediate risk for CV events,
there were further reductions in CVD for those who had been originally allocated to receive rosuvastatin during the active phase.
During the passive follow-up phase, the use of statins was similar

During the passive follow-up phase, patients originally randomized to
rosuvastatin compared with placebo had a further 20% reduction in
risk of MACE-1 [146 events (3.1%) in the rosuvastatin group vs. 181
events (3.9%) in the placebo group; HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.64-0.99], with
a similar trend towards benefit for MACE-2 [173 (3.7%) in the rosuvastatin group vs. 207 (4.5%) in the placebo group; HR 0.83, 95% CI
0.68-1.01]. There was a 19% reduction in MACE-2 plus angina [177
events (3.8%) in those originally randomized to rosuvastatin vs. 215
events (4.6%) in those originally randomized to placebo; HR 0.81,
95% CI 0.67-0.99] and a 46% reduction in coronary ischaemic events
[28 events (0.6%) in those on rosuvastatin vs. 51 events (1.1%) in
those on placebo; HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.34-0.86] (Table 1).

(37%) in those originally allocated to receive rosuvastatin or placebo.
These results indicate a sustained and perhaps enhanced benefit (legacy effect) that lasts for at least 3 years after the first 5.6 years of active therapy (Graphical abstract). These findings are consistent with
the known effects of statin-based LDL-C lowering on the structure
of the arterial wall and plaque morphology and composition that may
explain a lasting effect even after treatment is stopped.11,12 By lowering serum LDL-C, statins may reduce the size of the lipid core leading
to plaque stabilization, and can also induce plaque regression or stabilization. Statins have also been reported to improve vascular
remodelling.13 The full effects of statins on plaque stabilization and regression are dependent on the magnitude of LDL-C lowering and
duration of intervention. Previous reports suggest that the clinical
benefits of statins take at least 6-12 months to become evident.14,15
Our results, demonstrating further benefits of rosuvastatin during
3.1 years of passive follow-up in those previously treated for
5.6 years, suggest that the clinical benefits may be due to plaque stabilization, regression, and vascular remodelling and may continue for
several years after the cessation of statin therapy. However, our data

should not be interpreted that statins should be discontinued after 5
or 6 years of treatment, but instead indicate that sustained and
enhanced benefits occur even after stopping statin therapy. It is quite
possible that had we been able to continue active treatment vs. control, the net benefits observed after 9 or 10 years may have been
even larger.
Longer-term observation also reveals larger absolute risk reduction among those allocated to receive rosuvastatin. The absolute risk
reduction for MACE-1 was 1.1% and for MACE-2 was 1.3% during
the in-trial period, and this increased to 1.5% and 1.8% for the entire
duration of follow-up of over 8 years. This is relevant for informing
physicians and guidelines about the absolute long-term benefits of
statin therapy in CV prevention.
Our results are similar to the sustained benefits of statin therapy
on MACE and CV mortality described in the West of Scotland
Coronary Prevention Study (WOSCOPS) 20-year follow-up and on
mortality in the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial-Lipid
Lowering Arm (ASCOT-LLA) Legacy Study (Table 3). WOSCOPS
demonstrated that 40 mg daily of pravastatin reduced MACE by 25%

(95% CI 0.62-0.91, P = 0.004) during the 4.8-year trial. After an additional 15 years of post-trial observational follow-up, there was a further 20% reduction in MACE (95% CI 0.71-0.90, P < 0.001).16 The
ASCOT-LLA trial was stopped after 3.3 years because of a clear
benefit of atorvastatin (10 mg) on myocardial infarction or CV death
(HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.50-0.83, P = 0.0005). At that time, there was a
non-significant 15% reduction in CV death (P = 0.51). There was a
14% further non-significant reduction in CV death during the 12 years
of additional follow-up (only mortality data were collected during
passive follow-up), and over the total 15.7 years of follow-up, there
was a 15% significant reduction in CV death (95% CI 0.72-0.99,
P = 0.0395).17 Both WOSCOPS and ASCOT-LLA enrolled participants with elevated LDL-C and so our study adds new information
regarding the sustained benefits of statins in those with average LDLC levels (Table 3). The only other trial of statin therapy in a primary
prevention population with long-term passive follow-up, the
ALLHAT-LLA Long-Term Follow-up, did not demonstrate an effect
during either the in-trial or post-trial periods.18 This result was
deemed to be due to a modest difference in LDL-C (0.5 mmol/L) between the active and placebo groups. Although we did not observe a

significant effect of rosuvastatin on CV death, there was a non-significant trend with a 15% relative risk reduction both during the active
intervention and the passive follow-up phases, which is directionally
similar to the WOSCOPS and ASCOT-LLA results and proportionate to the smaller difference in LDL-C. Our results for MACE were
also similar to those seen in WOSCOPS after 20 years, although
there are important differences between the populations studied.
The WOSCOPS long-term observation studied 5529 Scottish
men aged 45-64 years with very high mean LDL-C of 4.9 mmol/L
(190 mg/dL) or greater, whereas in HOPE-3, mean LDL-C at baseline
was 3.3 mmol/L (127.8 mg/dL), which is much lower and would be
considered to be an 'average' level. Individuals with such average levels of LDL-C are typically not targeted for statin therapy in primary
prevention settings by most physicians and primary prevention guidelines. Furthermore, HOPE-3 included a higher proportion of women
(46% of the study population) than previous trials (WOSCOPS
enrolled only men and only 13% of the ASCOT-LLA participants
were women). By including a large proportion (80%) of participants
who were not from Western countries, our study is one of few providing new information in those with lower LDL-C, in women and in

non-European populations. This makes our results more widely
applicable.
Our study tested the effects of BP lowering in a general population
opposed to the reduction in BP among those with hypertension.
While there were no differences in the number of events between
those who were randomized to receive BP-lowering therapy vs. controls in the overall trial population, pre-specified subgroup analyses
during the active phase indicated significant benefits in those in the
highest third of baseline systolic BP (>143.5 mmHg) with little benefit
in the middle third, and perhaps a trend towards excess events in the
lowest third. During the passive follow-up phase, the pattern of
results was generally similar to that observed in the active phase;
there were fewer events for those with highest systolic BP who had
been randomized to BP lowering compared with those randomized
to placebo, but the differences were not statistically significant.
Consequently, over the entire 8.7 years of follow-up, those in the
highest tertile of systolic BP allocated to BP-lowering medication had
a 24% reduction in MACE-1 (95% CI 0.62-0.94) with little benefit in
those with lower levels of systolic BP (P for trend 0.012). The lack of
benefit from BP lowering in those in the lower two-thirds of BP

distribution, both in the active and passive phases of the trial, is noteworthy. This suggests that the approach to BP lowering should continue to focus on reducing elevated BP to guideline-recommended
targets.19 The benefits for those with the highest BP were seen over
8.7 years even though two-thirds of the passive follow-up participants
were on at least one BP-lowering medication and 30% were on two
or more BP-lowering medications. Sustained benefit of BP treatment,
even after cessation of BP-lowering medication, has previously been
reported in some, but not all antihypertensive trials6,17 but the mechanisms of benefit are less well understood than for lipid lowering.6
There are some data from animals and humans suggesting that BPlowering medications (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors,
angiotensin receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, and betablockers) increase plaque stability and decrease plaque volume.20
We were surprised that only 37% of the HOPE-3 participants
received statin therapy after the end of the active phase, despite demonstration of clear benefits. Sites were provided with summaries of
the study results and physicians were asked to share this information
with all their participants. Study participants were discharged to the
care of their personal physicians and a letter was sent to these

..
.. Following the end of randomized statin treatment, in patients without
..
.. prior CVD and at intermediate risk of CV events who were treated
.. with rosuvastatin for a median of 5.6 years, the benefits of treatment
..
.. continue to accrue for at least several years after it is discontinued.
.. Similar results were observed for BP-lowering treatment in those
..
.. with elevated BP, but not for those with systolic BP <140 mmHg.
.. These data underscore the importance of early treatment of risk fac..
.. tors and suggest that the benefits of primary prevention may be
.. underestimated in primary prevention trials that do not follow
..
.. patients beyond the period of active intervention.

physicians informing them of the results of the active study. The low
uptake of statins in our trial population after demonstration of clear
benefits suggests that demonstrating the benefits of prevention strategies and informing participants and their physicians of the results is
by itself inadequate to change clinical practice. Instead, additional
strategies to overcome health-care barriers after considering local
health systems barriers, and perhaps with the assistance of non-physician health workers, as was done in the HOPE-4 study,21 may be
needed to change practice.
The foundations for prevention of CVD are lifestyle modification,
including smoking cessation, moderate alcohol intake, healthy diet,
and regular exercise. However, these strategies are not fully implemented, and even when implemented, do not completely eliminate
the risk of CVD. Therefore, added interventions with drugs are often
required. In HOPE-3, all participants received advice on lifestyle
modification at every visit. Against this background we have demonstrated that in those at intermediate CV risk, long-term treatment
with rosuvastatin (in addition to advice on diet, activity, and smoking
cessation) reduces CV events. However, BP lowering appears to be
beneficial only in those with elevated BP. The combination of these
treatments will reduce CV events to a greater extent in those with
elevated BP. These results are in line with current guidelines for use
of statins and BP-lowering medications in primary prevention for
those at intermediate risk.22,23 These results are also consistent with
the report of the PolyIran study in which a polypill (enalapril 5 mg,
hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg, atorvastatin 20 mg, aspirin 81 mg) compared with placebo reduced CVD by 34% (95% CI 0.55-0.80), despite only a 1.4 mmHg reduction in systolic BP and a 0.51 mmol/L
(19.54 mg/dL) reduction in LDL-C over 5 years.24 Similar results have
also been reported by the recent International Polycap Study 3
(TIPS-3) trial where those randomized to receive a polypill (40 mg of
simvastatin, 100 mg of atenolol, 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide, and
10 mg of ramipril) had a 5.8 mmHg reduction in systolic BP and a
0.42 mmol/L reduction in LDL-C. This was associated with a reduction in the composite of CV death, myocardial infarction, stroke,
heart failure, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or arterial revascularization
by 21% (95% CI 0.63-1.00).25 After taking non-adherence into account, there was a 30% risk reduction in CVD, which was further
enhanced with the addition of aspirin (40% relative risk reduction).
Importantly, HOPE-3, PolyIran and TIPS-3 provide evidence of effectiveness in non-European populations.
Our study has a few potential limitations. First, we were able to follow only about 80% of those eligible at the end of the active phase of
the study. However, there was no evidence of selection biases, as the
majority of those not followed were not followed because centres
withdrew entirely. Furthermore, baseline characteristics of those followed were similar to those of the overall trial population during the
active phase. In addition, sensitivity analyses that excluded data from
centres who included <80% of randomized patients yielded similar
results. Second, our conclusions regarding the benefits of BP lowering
are based on a subgroup analysis of patients with highest baseline BP.
However, the benefits observed in patients with elevated BP are consistent with the results of several previous BP-lowering trials.26
Finally, although BP or LDL-C measurement at the end of the passive
phase was not available, there is no reason to believe that in the absence of differences in the rates of statin or BP medication use in the
