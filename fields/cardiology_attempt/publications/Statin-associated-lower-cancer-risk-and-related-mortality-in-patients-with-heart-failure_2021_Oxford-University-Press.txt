Aims

Patients with heart failure (HF) have an increased risk of incident cancer. Data relating to the association of statin
use with cancer risk and cancer-related mortality among patients with HF are sparse.

Using a previously validated territory-wide clinical information registry, statin use was ascertained among all eligible

patients with HF (n = 87 102) from 2003 to 2015. Inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to balance
and results

baseline covariates between statin nonusers (n = 50 926) with statin users (n = 36 176). Competing risk regression
with Cox proportional-hazard models was performed to estimate the risk of cancer and cancer-related mortality
associated with statin use. Of all eligible subjects, the mean age was 76.5 +/- 12.8 years, and 47.8% was male. Over a
median follow-up of 4.1 years (interquartile range: 1.6-6.8), 11 052 (12.7%) were diagnosed with cancer. Statin use
(vs. none) was associated with a 16% lower risk of cancer incidence [multivariable adjusted subdistribution hazard
ratio (SHR) = 0.84; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.80-0.89]. This inverse association with risk of cancer was duration dependent; as compared with short-term statin use (3 months to <2 years), the adjusted SHR was 0.99 (95%
CI, 0.87-1.13) for 2 to <4 years of use, 0.82 (95% CI, 0.70-0.97) for 4 to <6 years of use, and 0.78 (95% CI, 0.65-
0.93) for >_6 years of use. Ten-year cancer-related mortality was 3.8% among statin users and 5.2% among nonusers
(absolute risk difference, -1.4 percentage points [95% CI, -1.6% to -1.2%]; adjusted SHR = 0.74; 95% CI, 0.67-0.81).

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
Our study suggests that statin use is associated with a significantly lower risk of incident cancer and cancer-related
mortality in HF, an association that appears to be duration dependent.

Introduction
Heart failure (HF) and cancer are two major public health challenges
worldwide.1,2 The ageing demographics, along with increasing prevalence of antecedents, e.g. hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, obesity, and atrial fibrillation,3 are driving the epidemic of HF
globally. The improvement of HF management has further extended
the longevity and increased the clinical relevance of non-cardiac
morbidity and mortality in patients with HF. Recent epidemiological
studies have demonstrated that cancer is the leading cause of noncardiac death in patients with HF.4-6 Besides shared risk factors, such
as diabetes mellitus, smoking, and dyslipidemia, it has been hypothesized that HF is an oncogenic condition, possibly related to links between neurohormonal activation to tumorigenesis, systemic
pathological processes such as inflammation and oxidative stress,
common genetic predisposition, and clonal hematopoiesis of cancer
and HF.7,8 Preventive strategies to reduce the burden of cancer in HF
patients is hence urgently needed.
Both experimental9 and clinical data10-12 suggest that statin may
be chemoprotective through diverse potential mechanisms including
inhibition of mevalonate pathway [a critical pathway (with its metabolites) integral for tumour development and growth],13 anti-

inflammatory, antioxidant, and immune-modulatory properties. To
date, there is a paucity of studies evaluating the association of statin
use with cancer risk and cancer-related mortality in patients with HF.
Accordingly, in this territory-wide cohort study, we aim to examine
the relationship between the use of statin and the risk of cancer and
cancer-related mortality among patients with HF.

Methods
This is a retrospective cohort study conducted with data from the
Clinical Data Analysis Reporting System (CDARS), a territory-wide database developed by the Hong Kong Hospital Authority. As the statutory
body and the singular provider of public healthcare services in Hong
Kong, the Hospital Authority provides over 80% of inpatient services in
Hong Kong, a territory with a population of 7.5 million.14 CDARS prospectively collects patient information including, but not limited to, demographic data, diagnoses, drug prescriptions, procedures, laboratory tests,
and episodes of hospital visits since 1993.15 Prior studies have demonstrated a high percentage of coding accuracy in CDARS data.15-18
Diagnostic data, specifically, were determined by using the International
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9), also shown to have a
high coding accuracy.19,20

Statin use is associated with a significantly lower risk of incident cancer and cancer-related mortality in patients with heart failure and results were consistent across clinical subgroups and in sensitivity analyses. The potential protective effect of statin on development of cancer merits evaluation in future
randomized studies.

Patient data (name and Hong Kong identification number) were deidentified in CDARS and unique reference numbers were generated. The
study was approved by the institutional review board of the University of
Hong Kong and the West Cluster of the Hong Kong Hospital Authority.

Outcome definition and study subjects
We searched for all patients aged 18 years old or above with HF (ICD-9:
402, 404, 425, 428) as a primary cause of hospitalization between 1
January 2003 and 1 January 2015. We subsequently identified all episodes
of statin dispenses among the cohort, and the index date was defined as
the date of first diagnosis of HF. We also excluded patients who were
diagnosed with HF between 1 January 1993 to 31 December 2002
(n = 19 237) to ensure the recruited patients had no prior history of HF.
Furthermore, patients who had any history of cancer or cancer incidence
within 90 days after the first diagnosis of HF, death within 90 days after
the first diagnosis of HF, human immunodeficiency disease (HIV), and
<90 days statin use within the first year of HF diagnosis were excluded
(Figure 1). The primary outcome of the study was that of incident cancer
subsequent to the diagnosis of HF, for which the association with statin
use was determined. Patients were followed up until a diagnosis of cancer, death, or 31 December 2018, whichever came earlier.

..
.. Exposure definition
.. We used an intention-to-treat design in the study, where statin exposure
..
.. was defined as >_90 days consecutive use of statin beginning within the
.. first year after the index date, as defined in previous publications.17,21 In
..
.. further analysis, we modelled statin use as a time-varying exposure to as.. sess duration response. To evaluate duration, we summed the duration
.. of all filled prescriptions (in days) and updated these data at each yearly
..
.. interval of follow-up. Patients who received statin for a period of <90
.. consecutive days within the first year of HF diagnosis were excluded
..
.. (n = 3775). The types of statins that were available in the public sector
.. during the study period include simvastatin, atorvastatin, and rosuvastatin.
.. Accordingly, we identified 36 176 statin users and 50 926 statin nonusers
..
.. after the index date.
..
..
.. Statin users
.. As different indications for statins could potentially define different sub..
.. populations of patients with HF, the presence of an indication for statin
.. use was classified into: atherosclerotic disease (n = 21 894, 60.5%) defined
..
.. based on ICD coding (coronary artery disease, ICD-9: 410-414/periph.. eral vascular disease, ICD-9: 440-444, 447/stroke, ICD-9: 430-438);
.. hypercholesterolaemia (n = 8326, 23.0%) based on ICD coding

>2.6 mmol/L;22 and undefined (n = 5956, 16.5%), where the exact indication was uncertain due to the lack of corresponding ICD coding or valid
lipid baseline profile. We further evaluated the lipid control of statin users
by calculating the time-weighted mean of LDL level (defined by timeweighted mean of LDL level from 3 months following initiation of statin
until endpoint).23 Among all statin users, 31 454 (86.9%) patients had
post-statin LDL level available and were subsequently categorized
according to the time-weighted mean of LDL <1.8 mmol/L (n = 9879,
31.4%), LDL 1.8-2.6 mmol/L (n = 15 319, 48.7%), and LDL >2.6 mmol/L
(n = 6256, 19.9%).

Study covariates
We traced patient records to 3 years prior to the index date and collected data including age at index date, sex, comorbidities (diabetes, obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, arrhythmias, coronary heart disease,
vascular diseases, stroke, cirrhosis, chronic renal failure, Parkinson disease, ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus), and drug history (baseline use of aspirin,
antihypertensives, anti-diabetics, beta-blockers, statin) as well as lifestyle
factors (alcoholism and smoking).22 Baseline drug use was defined as

.. To address biases in the allocation of treatment due to lack of randomiza.. tion, a propensity score approach was used. Covariates that were consid.. ered prognostically significant as well as those that influenced treatment

.. allowing a pseudo-population to be created through assigning individuals
..
.. with weights that corresponded to the inverse of their probability of
.. receiving treatment given observed covariates. The differences in the
..
.. prevalence of covariates between statin users and nonusers were consid.. ered insignificant if the standardized mean difference was <_0.10. Cox pro..
.. portional-hazards modelling was used, and statin exposure was further
.. entered as a time-dependent variable to determine the effect of statin

Statin user was defined by filled prescription for at least 90 consecutive days of statin use after the index date. Ten-year cumulative incidence, absolute risk difference, and hazard estimates were obtained with the use of a proportional subdistribution hazards regression model fit to the inverse probability of treatment weighted cohort that accounted
for competing risks; the model was conditioned on age at index date.

A multivariable adjusted model further accounted for the following prognostic covariates: age at index date, sex, presence or absence of alcohol, smoking, comorbidities,
including diabetes, obesity, hypertension, arrhythmia, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, stroke, Parkinson disease, dyslipidemia, chronic renal failure, cirrhosis,
ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and baseline use of aspirin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin
receptor blockers, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, diuretics, statin, and metformin.

Q.-W. Ren et al.

We further performed conventional Cox regression without competing risks or without considering propensity score for comparison
to previous cohort studies;13,26,27 as well as subgroup analyses by age,
sex, alcohol, smoke, comorbidities (diabetes and hypertension), and
baseline drug use (aspirin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor,
angiotensin receptor blockers, metformin) after accounting for competing risk. Several sensitivity analyses were conducted including: (i)
models excluding persons with a history of alcohol abuse (n = 1486)
or smoking (n = 9617); (ii) using an alternative 1:1 propensity score
matched design; (iii) analyses excluding patients with any history of
statin use (n = 18 131); (iv) analyses excluding patients with a diagnosis
of incident cancer or death within 3 years after the index date
(n = 46 701), to minimize reverse causation;24 and (v) analyses of the
relationship between statin use and incident gastrointestinal bleeding
(excluding those with a prior history of gastrointestinal bleeding and
simultaneous digestive cancer), as a falsification endpoint. All statistical
analyses were performed using R v4.0.2.28-31

Statin user was defined by filled prescription for at least 90 consecutive days of statin use after the index date. The cumulative duration of statin use was modelled as a timevarying exposure. Ten-year cumulative incidence and hazard estimates were obtained with the use of a proportional subdistribution hazards regression model fit to the inverse
probability of treatment weighted cohort that accounted for competing risks; the model was conditioned on age at index date.
b
A multivariable adjusted model further accounted for the following prognostic covariates: age at index date, sex, presence or absence of alcohol, smoking, comorbidities
including diabetes, obesity, hypertension, arrhythmia, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, stroke, Parkinson disease, dyslipidemia, chronic renal failure, cirrhosis,
ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and baseline use of aspirin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin
receptor blockers, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, diuretics, statin, and metformin.

after multivariable adjustment (SHR = 0.84; 95% CI, 0.80-0.89)
(Table 2).
To enable comparisons to prior reports, we also computed the
multivariable SHR before propensity matching (0.82; 95% CI, 0.78-
0.86). Without consideration of competing risks, a conventional multivariable Cox regression yielded a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.83 (95% CI,
0.80-0.87) for cancer risk (Supplementary material online, Table S5).

Cancer-related mortality
The 10-year cancer-related mortality was 3.8% (1390 episodes)
among statin users and 5.2% (2474 episodes) among nonusers
(Figure 3). The use of statin was significantly associated with a lower
adjusted risk of cancer-related death than nonusers (SHR = 0.74;
95% CI, 0.67-0.81) (Table 2). Of interest, the 10-year all-cause mortality was 60.5% (21 886 episodes) among statin users and 78.8%
(40 130 episodes) among nonusers. The use of statin was significantly
associated with a lower adjusted risk of all-cause mortality than nonusers (HR = 0.62; 95% CI 0.61-0.64).

Statin users
Among statin users, the crude 10-year cumulative incidence of cancer
among those with atherosclerotic disease (11.34%) and hypercholesterolaemia (11.27%, as indications for statin initiation) did not differ
(absolute risk difference: 0.07%, P > 0.05). Similarly, the corresponding incidence among lipid control (time-weighted mean LDL measured at least 3 months following statin initiation) groups defined by
LDL <1.8, 1.8-2.6, and >2.6 mmol/L was 10.3%, 10.5%, and 10.8%
(P > 0.05), respectively. After multivariable adjustment and accounting for competing risk, cancer incidence in statin users was not
related to the indication for statin (atherosclerotic disease vs. hypercholesterolaemia, SHR = 1.01, 95% CI 0.81-1.26) or time-weighted
LDL control (LDL 1.8-2.6 vs. LDL > 2.6 mmol/L, SHR = 1.01, 95% CI

use) was associated with a lower incidence of cancers involving the
colorectum, lung, liver, lymph, breast, haematological system, pancreas, and kidney; with no association for cancers involving the stomach, skin, prostate, brain, bladder, female reproductive system, head,
or oesophagus (all following IPTW adjustment and accounting for
competing risks). However, these results should be interpreted with
caution because of small sample size in some subgroups
(Supplementary material online, Table S7).

Sensitivity analysis
Sensitivity analyses revealed consistent results after excluding
patients with a history of alcohol abuse (SHR for incident cancer,
0.82; 95% CI, 0.80-0.89) or patients with a history of smoking (SHR
for incident cancer, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.79-0.87). Without propensity
matching, a multivariable SHR was 0.82 (95% CI, 0.78-0.86). Without
consideration of competing risks, a conventional multivariable Cox
regression yielded a HR of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.80-0.87) for cancer risk
(Supplementary material online, Table S5). We further created a 1:1
matched cohort using the propensity score directly without IPTW.
Upon trimming 5% of the propensity score, each statin user was
matched in a fixed 1:1 ratio with a statin nonuser using a 'genetic' algorithm with a caliper of 0.0001. Using this approach, we successfully

matched 30 845 statin users to 35 735 nonusers to create a propensity score matched cohort of 66 580 patients; the multivariable
adjusted SHR was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.77-0.84) after accounting for competing risk (Supplementary material online, Table S8). Furthermore,
we excluded 18 131 patients with a history of baseline statin use to
include only new users of statin after the index date followed by a 1:1
propensity score matching to create a matched cohort (n = 28 894).
After accounting for competing risk, multivariable adjusted SHRs of
the association between statin new user and risk of incident cancer
and cancer-related mortality were 0.80 (95% CI, 0.75-0.86) and 0.70
(95%CI, 0.62-0.78) compared with nonuser, respectively
(Supplementary material online, Table S9). After excluding patients
with incident cancer diagnosed within the first 3 years after the index
date, the multivariable adjusted SHR was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.81-0.96)
among statin users compared with nonusers after accounting for
competing risk (Supplementary material online, Table S10). We finally
used gastrointestinal bleeding as a negative control, of which we
excluded 20 644 patients with a prior history of gastrointestinal
bleeding diagnosis before the index date of HF and 435 patients with
simultaneous digestive cancer, for further analysis (Supplementary
material online, Table S11). Among the remaining 66 023 patients,
7937 diagnoses of gastrointestinal bleeding were recorded between

Discussion

Mechanisms of statin's chemoprotective effects in patients with HF
is uncertain but can be postulated by multiple pleiotropic properties
of statin, in addition to the cholesterol-lowering effect. First, the presence of escalated inflammation and oxidative stress is a common milieu in HF and cancer. For instance, proinflammatory cytokines
correlate with incident HF in the general population29 and are associated with adverse outcome in HF.30 Chronic inflammation correspondingly contributes to cancer initiation and progression which
result in poorer outcome.31 The prominent anti-inflammatory properties of statin may thus lessen the development of cancer in patients
with HF with an increased inflammatory load. Further, HF modulation
of p53 dependent pathways, not only induce cardiac apoptosis33 but
has also promoted carcinogenesis. The inhibition of the mevalonate
pathway by statin, up-regulated by p53, reverts the malignancy potential and reduce the invasiveness of in situ cancers.34 Finally, the potential to halt the cell-cycle progression in cancer cells, as a result of the
anti-proliferative effect of statin, may further justify the observed capacity to reduce the incidence of cancer, as well as cancer-related
mortality in our patients with HF.35 Our results provide further support for the pleiotropic effects of statin, independent of LDL-cholesterol, in that neither the underlying indication for statin
(atherosclerotic disease vs. hypercholesterolaemia) nor the extent of
lipid control (measured by time-weighted mean LDL) was associated
with incident cancer among statin users. It is noteworthy that despite
the presence of an established indication for statin therapy, a substantial proportion of patients with coronary artery disease (23.3%),
stroke (9%), and dyslipidaemia (5.2%) did not receive statins.
Although the exact reason is uncertain, we postulate that a higher
rate of statin intolerance among Asians may have contributed to the
observed suboptimal adherence. Indeed, Asian ethnicity is included
among the list of risk factors for statin-associated muscle symptoms
by the European Atherosclerosis Society Consensus Panel
Statement,36 and prior studies in Asian patients with atherosclerotic
cardiovascular disease have shown discontinuation rates of up to
33% within 12 months of initiating either a statin or ezetimibe.37
There are several limitations in the present study. Risk factors such
as a family history of cancer were not available. Nonetheless, variables such as family history are unlikely to impact drug prescription,
thus conferring minimal confounder effects in drug-cancer association studies.38 Furthermore, the left ventricular ejection fraction of
our patients was not recorded in the reporting system and thus the
differential chemoprotective effect in HF patients with preserved and
reduced ejection fraction of statin cannot be evaluated. Studies have
consistently shown that HF was associated with cancer incidence, irrespective of left ventricular ejection fraction,4,5,32 indicating that our
finding can conceivably be generalizable to a wide range of HF
patients. Finally, it is possible that residual confounders remain despite utilizing propensity score analytics,
Strengths of the present study include the use of a territory-wide,
well-validated electronic healthcare database (CDARS) with records
of all diagnoses, hospitalizations, and details of drug dispenses, allowing the collection of the relevant information required to preclude
common biases in conventional observational studies such as selection and recall biases. The validity of the current result is further
improved by the adjustment of potential chemoprotective agents,
such as metformin19 and aspirin,24 that is commonly prescribed concomitantly with statin. Furthermore, statin users are likely to have

In this territory-wide cohort study of >87 000 patients with HF, we
demonstrated that statin use was independently associated with a
16% decrease in risk of developing cancer and a 26% decrease in risk
of cancer-related mortality. There was some evidence of a dose-response relationship, with longer durations (4-6 and >6 years) of statin use being associated with a lower risk of cancer and cancerrelated mortality compared to short-term use (<2 years). Results
were consistent across clinical subgroups and in sensitivity analyses
(Graphical Abstract).
Advancement of treatment has greatly improved the clinical outcome of patients with HF, with a two-fold improvement of 5-year
survival rates from 29.1% between 1970 and 1979 to 59.7% between
2000 and 2009.3 A decline in cardiovascular mortality was however
offset by a considerable increase in non-cardiovascular mortality,
with cancer-related death being the most prevalent cause.26 While
one may attribute that the increased cancer-related mortality in
patients with HF could be due to shared comorbidities among the
two conditions, accumulating evidence has suggested that HF per se
may predispose to cancer development, for example through hyperactivation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which also
promotes tumour growth.27 In a large cohort involving 9307 patients
with HF, the risk of cancer was found to be 24% greater compared to
patients without HF.5 In patients with myocardial infarction, those
who developed HF had a 71% higher risk of developing cancer compared with those without HF.6 The increased risk of cancer in
patients with HF was further confirmed by a case-control study that
demonstrated a higher incidence of cancer, irrespective of diabetes
control measured by glycated haemoglobin.32 Thus, beyond shared
risk factors, HF itself may be an oncogenic condition, possibly related
to links between neurohormonal activation to tumorigenesis, systemic pathological processes such as inflammation and oxidative
stress, common genetic predisposition and clonal haematopoiesis of
cancer and HF.7,8 These findings underscore the strong association of
HF with cancer, and call for potential strategies to reduce the risk of
cancer and cancer-related mortality in patients with HF. Our result
corroborates prior literature suggesting an inverse association between statin use and cancer development and extends these observations for the first time to a large Asian population-based cohort. In
an observational study that utilized pharmacy records of dispensing
history in eight Dutch cities, regular use of statin was associated with
a 20% risk reduction of cancer.28 In a nationwide study, statin users
had a 15% risk reduction cancer-related mortality, regardless of the
administrative dose.10 These non-randomized studies without consideration for some indications of statin, however, may be susceptible
to biases in allocation of treatment, and also are limited in their consideration of confounders including co-morbidities and concurrent
drug uses. The vigorous adjustment of these confounders in our
study provides compelling evidence of the chemoprotective role of
statin in patients with HF.

Conclusion
In this large population-based cohort of patients with HF, we demonstrated that incident cancer was not uncommon; notably, statin use
was associated with a reduced risk of cancer and cancer-related mortality. These findings have major clinical implications to reduce the
associated burden in HF. The potential protective effect of statin on
the development of cancer merits evaluation in future randomized
studies.

more comorbidities than nonusers, which minimize the concern of
healthy user bias. The application of IPTW to an unselected population with HF with detailed clinical and medication history provides
compelling evidence regarding the potential benefits of statin in the
reduction of cancer risk and cancer-related mortality. In addition, we
found that statin's chemoprotective effect is present in a duration-response manner by using a time-varying model, indicative of a potential causal relationship. The reduction of cancer incidence and
cancer-related mortality with at least 4 years of statin use is consistent with the result from other observational studies.24,39,40 The current study, therefore, provides robust evidence on the relationship
between statin and risk of cancer in patients with HF through a thorough consideration of potential sources of confounding and biases.
