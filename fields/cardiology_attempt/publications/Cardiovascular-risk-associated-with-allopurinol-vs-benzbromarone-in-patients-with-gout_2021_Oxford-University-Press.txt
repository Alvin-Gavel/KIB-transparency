Aims

With the high prevalence of gout and associated cardiovascular (CV) diseases, information on the comparative CV
safety of individual urate-lowering drugs becomes increasingly important. However, few studies examined the CV
risk of uricosuric agents. We compared CV risk among patients with gout who initiated allopurinol vs.
benzbromarone.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
Using the Korean National Health Insurance claims data (2002-17), we conducted a cohort study of 124 434 gout
and results
patients who initiated either allopurinol (n = 103 695) or benzbromarone (n = 20 739), matched on propensity
score at a 5:1 ratio. The primary outcome was a composite CV endpoint of myocardial infarction, stroke/transient
ischaemic attack, or coronary revascularization. To account for competing risk of death, we used cause-specific
hazard models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the outcomes comparing
allopurinol initiators with benzbromarone. Over a mean follow-up of 1.16 years, 2258 patients developed a composite CV event. The incidence rate of the composite CV event was higher in allopurinol initiators (1.81 per 100
person-years) than benzbromarone (1.61 per 100 person-years) with a HR of 1.22 (95% CI 1.05-1.41). The HR for
all-cause mortality was 1.66 (95% CI 1.43-1.93) among allopurinol initiators compared with benzbromarone.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
In this large population-based cohort of gout patients, allopurinol was associated with an increased risk of compos-

ite CV events and all-cause mortality compared to benzbromarone. Benzbromarone may reduce CV risk and
mortality in patients with gout, although more studies are necessary to confirm our findings and to advance our
understanding of the underlying mechanisms.

Introduction
Cardiovascular (CV) disease is the global leading cause of death, with
an estimated 17.9 million people who died of CV disease in 2016,
representing 31% of all global deaths.1 A total of 85% of these CV
deaths were due to myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke and onethird of them occurred prematurely under the age of 70 years.1
Moreover, CV mortality has been the top health issue not only
among high income countries2,3 but also among middle-to-low income countries.4 Due to the potential disabilities associated with
these CV conditions, CV disease causes immense health and economic burden.
Gout is the most common inflammatory arthritis in adults, caused
by monosodium urate (MSU) crystal deposits in the joints and soft
tissues.5 It affects up to 4% of the US population and 1-4% of
Western Europeans.5,6 Patients with gout show an increased risk of
CV morbidity and mortality associated with ischaemic heart disease,
stroke, and/or heart failure.7 In a health professionals follow-up study,
the adjusted risk of CV death and fatal coronary heart disease was

estimated to increase by 38% and 55%, respectively, among men with
history of gout compared with men without.8 However, it is still
debated whether such association is causal or simply a residual confounding by traditional CV risk factors highly prevalent in patients
with gout. The causal scenario suggests that the mechanisms are likely
multifactorial involving hyperuricaemia, xanthine oxidase (XO) activation, oxidative stress, and chronic inflammation.7,9 The finding that
the key cytokine of inflammation is IL-1b in both gout and atherosclerosis may also support causal relationship of gout and CV disease.10 However, the exact mechanism is not fully understood.
In the context of high prevalence of gout and associated CV outcomes, there has been a need for information on the comparative
CV safety of individual urate-lowering drugs. Under such backgrounds, a number of studies have focused on the CV effects of XO
inhibitors such as allopurinol and febuxostat because of their capability to suppress both XO activity and hyperuricaemia and to reduce
oxidative stress.9 However, two recent randomized controlled
trials (RCTs) comparing allopurinol and febuxostat, the CARES

Allopurinol, compared to benzbromarone, was associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality among patients with gout.

Methods
Data source
We conducted a cohort study on gout patients who initiated allopurinol
or benzbromarone using the 2002-2017 Korea National Health
Insurance Service (KNHIS) database. KNHIS is a universal and mandatory
health insurance service that provides comprehensive medical care
coverage of the entire Korean population.28 The database contains longitudinal patient data including demographics, International Classification of
Diseases Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis codes, procedures, pharmacy dispensing records, and type of medical utilization (outpatient, inpatient, or emergency department). This study complies with the
Declaration of Helsinki, and the Institutional Review Board of the Seoul
National University Bundang Hospital approved the study protocol (X1905/543-902). Informed consent was waived based on fully de-identified
database.

Study cohort
Eligible patients were those who had ICD-10 diagnosis codes for gout
and dispensed any of gout-related medications (i.e. colchicine,

.. allopurinol, febuxostat, benzbromarone, or probenecid). In Korea,
..
.. allopurinol and benzbromarone have been equivalently available to
.. treat gout. However, physicians may prefer using allopurinol over uri..
.. cosuric agents as the first-line treatment, based on the international
.. guidelines.21 To avoid confounding by indication associated with differ..
.. ent gout severity and duration, we only included incident new users of
.. either allopurinol or benzbromarone devoid of any urate-lowering
.. drugs during a 365-day period (= baseline period) before the first
..
.. dispensing of the study drug (= index date), excluding prevalent
.. new users who initiated allopurinol or benzbromarone as a 2nd-line
..
.. treatment.
..
..
.. Outcomes
.. The primary outcome of interest was a composite CV endpoint of hospi.. talized MI, stroke/transient ischaemic attack (TIA), or coronary revascula..
.. rization. Secondary outcomes were individual components of the
.. primary outcome, CV mortality, and all-cause mortality. MI and stroke/
..
.. TIA were defined using inpatient ICD-10 diagnosis codes (MI 121.xx;
.. stroke/TIA 160.xx, 161.xx, 163.xx, 164.xx, and G45.x). Coronary revas..
.. cularization was identified using inpatient procedural codes. These algo.. rithms were validated to have positive predictive values of >80% to
.. detect corresponding CV outcomes from the claims data.29-31 CV mor..
.. tality was defined as deaths associated with ICD-10 codes of I20-I25 (is.. chaemic heart diseases) or I60-I69 (cerebrovascular diseases). Non-CV
..
.. mortality was defined as deaths associated with any ICD-10 do except
.. I00-I99 (diseases of the circulatory system). To identify CV and non-CV
.. deaths, Korea national mortality data (https://kosis.kr/statisticsList) were
..
.. linked to the KNHIS database.
..
..
.. Covariates
.. We assessed variables potentially associated with CV outcomes and gout
..
.. severity during the baseline period. These variables included index year,
.. demographics, pre-existing CV conditions, traditional CV risk factors (i.e.
.. hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, renal
..
.. diseases), gout medications (i.e. colchicine, non-steroidal anti-inflamma.. tory drugs, cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, and steroids), other comorbid..
.. ities and medications, and healthcare utilization factors (i.e.
.. hospitalization, emergency department visits, and the use of laboratory
..
comorbidity
.. or diagnostic tests). We calculated the Charlson-Deyo
.. index score to further balance comorbidities.32
..
..
.. Statistical analysis
.. To control for >60 baseline potential confounders, we used propensity
..
.. score (PS) matching. To estimate a PS, we constructed a multivariable lo.. gistic regression model that included all baseline covariates listed in Table
..
.. 1. Nearest neighbour matching for allopurinol vs benzbromarone initia.. tors was done with a 5:1 ratio with the maximum calliper of 0.025 on the
.. PS scale. Covariate balance after PS matching was considered achieved
..
.. with absolute standardized differences of <0.1 between the two treat.. ment groups.33
..
..
For the primary as-treated analysis, follow-up started from the day
.. after the index date and ended on the earliest date of the following cen..
.. soring events: outcome occurrence, study drug discontinuation, drug
.. switching, end of database, or death. Study drug discontinuation was
.. defined as no dispensing record within 90 days of the last dispensing date
..
.. plus days of supply, in which case censoring occurred after a 30-day grace
.. period from the last dispensing date plus days of supply. Adding or switch..
.. ing to different urate-lowering agents resulted in immediate censoring.
.. Drug adherence was calculated using a proportion of days covered
.. (PDC) defined as the sum of days of supply divided by the total days of
..
. follow-up. For the secondary 1-year intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis,

Gout and CV Morbidities) and FAST (Long-term Cardiovascular
Safety of Febuxostat Compared with Allopurinol in Patients with
Gout), raised a question on CV benefits of XO inhibition, showing no
relationship between CV risk and the potency of individual XO inhibitors,11,12 and suggested that individual urate lowering drugs may
have different CV effects.13
Unlike XO inhibitors, data on CV effects of uricosuric agents have
been sparse. A recent large Medicare study reported a decreased
risk of CV events and all-cause mortality associated with probenecid
compared to allopurinol,14 possibly through other mechanisms than
urate-lowering action. Benzbromarone is another uricosuric agent
inhibiting a renal tubular transporter, URAT-1.15 It shows high efficacy and safety in general even for patients with chronic kidney disease16,17 but was not approved in the USA and withdrawn from
some European countries based on several hepatotoxicity reports.
However, withdrawal decision of the drug has often been questioned
based on the risk estimated <1:17 000.18-20 Currently, it is still actively used in Asia including South Korea, some countries of Europe, and
South America to treat gout. The 2016 EULAR guideline for gout
management recommends to use benzbromarone alone or in combination with allopurinol when the initial treatment with allopurinol is
not effective enough to lower serum urate (SU) levels.21
Benzbromarone exhibits pleiotropic actions beyond urate-lowering effect.22-27 For example, benzbromarone enhanced insulin sensitivity and led to decreased inflammatory cytokine secretion from
immune cells among patients with heart failure22 or gout patients.23
Also, direct radical scavenging activity of benzbromarone protected
endothelial cells treated with uric acids.24,25 Recently, a unique vascular effect of benzbromarone was reported that reverses vasoconstriction and pulmonary vascular remodelling in animal models of
pulmonary arterial hypertension via at least two different mechanisms.26,27 However, CV data of benzbromarone are scanty among
gout patients.
In this study, we compared the CV risk between new users of allopurinol and benzbromarone among patients with gout using a nationally representative health insurance claims data in South Korea.

patients contributed to person-time in their exposure group for a maximum of 365 days regardless of treatment discontinuation or switching
during the follow-up period.
Incidence rates (IRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for the primary and secondary outcomes among the PS-matched
study cohort. To estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for the primary and secondary outcomes, we performed a cause-specific hazard
model comparing allopurinol vs. benzbromarone, to account for the
competing risk of death.34 When CV mortality risk was compared, we
accounted for non-CV mortality as a competing risk. For follow-up
time stratified analysis, we first sorted PS-matched study participants
into three groups according to their follow-up time (<_1.5, >1.5 and
<_3, and >3 years), then ran a matched set stratified cause-specific hazard model within three individual groups.35 Proportional hazards assumption was tested by including the interaction term between
exposure and follow-up time and was not violated in any of the models.36 All analyses were completed using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute)

Results
Baseline characteristics of study
participants
Figure 1 summarizes our study cohort selection process. We identified 788 176 (97.6%) incident new users from 807 883 allopurinol initiators, and 20 739 (44.8%) from 46 340 benzbromarone initiators.
Their PS distributions showed an excellent overlap (Supplementary
material online, Figure S1).
As expected from their good PS overlap, the two treatment
groups showed a relatively balanced covariate distribution even before PS matching with the standardized difference values of <0.1 for
most of the covariates (Table 1). However, CV comorbidities were
slightly more prevalent among benzbromarone users than allopurinol: atrial fibrillation (4.2% vs. 3.3%), hypertension (53.1% vs. 49.3%),
chronic kidney disease (13.1% vs. 9.2%), dyslipidemia (43.5% vs.
36.6%), and diabetes (27.9% vs. 26.4%). Benzbromarone users also
had higher cumulative steroid doses than allopurinol users. The

..
.. 1.62 +/- 1.81 and 1.51 +/- 1.83, for benzbromarone and allopurinol

(27.1%), and 150 mg (21.0%). The mean (SD) index dose was 221
(102) mg/day for allopurinol and 84 (42) mg/day for benzbromarone, and the mean maximal dose was 248 (139) mg/day
and 88 (51) mg/day. The mean PDC (SD) of the study drugs
was 0.74 (0.34) for allopurinol and 0.82 (0.29) for
benzbromarone.

Comparative CV risk between
allopurinol vs. benzbromarone initiators
Since we found that the risk of all-cause-mortality was significantly
higher among allopurinol vs. benzbromarone users (Table 2), we
performed a cause-specific hazard analysis for all of our non-fatal
CV outcomes accounting for the competing risk of death. In our
primary as-treated analysis, the IR per 100 person-years for the
composite CV endpoint was 1.81 in allopurinol users and 1.61 in
benzbromarone users. Consequently, the risk of composite CV
endpoints was 22% higher among allopurinol users than benzbromarone (PS-matched HR 1.22, 95% CI 1.05-1.41) (Table 2 and
Figure 2A). The PS-matched HRs (95% CI) for the secondary CV
outcomes showed overall the same direction as for the primary
outcome but without statistical significance. The PS-matched HR
(95% CI) of all-cause mortality was 1.66 (1.43-1.93) (Table 2 and
Figure 2B).
In our secondary ITT approach, the PS-matched HRs (95% CI) was
1.13 (1.00-1.28) and 1.96 (1.73-2.21) for the composite CV endpoint
and all-cause mortality, respectively (Table 2).

Notably, the number of deaths among allopurinol users was disproportionately higher than among benzbromarone users exceeding the
matching ratio of 5:1 for almost all causes, indicating that the mortality reduction with benzbromarone came from both CV and non-CV
causes.
The IR of CV death was numerically higher among allopurinol
users than benzbromarone (0.29-0.31 vs. 0.25 per 100 person-years)
(Supplementary material online, Table S3). Also, the Kaplan-Meier
curves diverged in favour of benzbromarone (Supplementary material online, Figure S2). However, the cause-specific analysis estimated

definition of the high-risk subgroup and Supplementary material online, Table S4 for their PS-matched covariate distribution), with a
mean age of 67.3 years and 72% male. The IR of composite CV endpoint was 3.75 and 3.68 per 100 person-years for allopurinol and
benzbromarone users, respectively, with a PS-matched HR (95% CI)
of 1.08 (0.90-1.29) adjusting for competing risk of death (Table 3).
We found a higher risk of all-cause mortality (PS-matched HR 1.37,
95% CI 1.14-1.65) among allopurinol users compared to
benzbromarone.

Covariate distribution analysis during
post-index 180 days
Lastly, we wanted to make sure that a higher risk of the composite
CV endpoint and all-cause mortality was not due to a disruption of
covariate balance soon after the index date. We looked at covariate
distributions in the two groups during post-index 180 days and found
that standardized differences were <0.1 for all covariates except for
hospitalization (22.8% in allopurinol users vs. 16.1% in benzbromarone users) and ECG testing ordered (28.7% in allopurinol users vs.
23.5% in benzbromarone users) (Supplementary material online,
Table S5). The 180-day cumulative steroid dose (167.53 vs.
139.50 mg of prednisolone equivalent dose) was numerically higher
among allopurinol users than benzbromarone.

NNT at 1 year of follow-up
While this study cannot prove the causality, Supplementary material
online, Table S6 shows the NNT with benzbromarone instead of allopurinol to prevent one additional patient from having the composite
CV endpoint or all-cause death. The NNT was 277 patients for the
composite CV event and 115 for all-cause death at 1-year follow-up.

Liver safety
The maximal daily dose of allopurinol was 300 mg or less in >93% of
the users while that of benzbromarone 150 mg or less in >99%
(Supplementary material online, Table S1). During the as-treated
follow-up, there were no hospitalizations associated with toxic
liver disease or hepatic failure in the primary position. Among hospitalizations with such diagnoses in the secondary position, three

discontinued the index drug, all of whom were allopurinol users.
Three cases (n = 2 for allopurinol, n = 1 benzbromarone) of liver
transplantation had chronic underlying liver diseases before the transplantation. There were 46 hepatic deaths (n = 40 for allopurinol,
n = 6 for benzbromarone) (Supplementary material online, Table S7):
benzbromarone users died of either alcoholic liver disease (n = 2) or
hepatitis B associated liver cirrhosis (n = 4) prior to death.
Taken together, there were no serious or fatal hepatic adverse
events attributable to benzbromarone within a dose range of
<_150 mg/day.

Discussion
In this large population-based cohort study, we found a 22%
increased risk of CV events and 66% of all-cause mortality, associated
with the use of allopurinol compared to benzbromarone, which
would correspond to a 1-year NNT with benzbromarone of 277
patients for the composite CV event and 115 for all-cause mortality.
The follow-up stratified analysis showed the difference in the risk of
non-fatal CV events and all-cause mortality was relatively consistent
across all follow-up periods. The IR of CV mortality was numerically
higher among allopurinol users than benzbromarone. In our subgroup analysis of high CV risk patients, we found no difference in the
risk of non-fatal CV events but increased risk of all-cause mortality
among allopurinol vs. benzbromarone users (Graphical abstract). To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that directly compared CV effect of allopurinol vs. benzbromarone among patients
with gout.
Similar to benzbromarone that exhibits pleiotropic effects,22-27
allopurinol has shown effects of scavenging oxygen radicals,39
improving insulin sensitivity,40 and anti-inflammatory actions.40 XO
inhibitors lower not only SU levels but also XO activity, both of
which lead to NO depletion.9 Due to this reason, XO inhibitors have
long been the primary pharmacologic candidate to modulate CV risk,
based on their theoretically greater blockade of oxidative stress compared to that of uricosuric agents. However, most gout patients are
under-excreters rather than over-producers of uric acids.41
Consistent with this, genome-wide association studies revealed that

hypertension.27 These unique CV actions of benzbromarone, together with its excellent urate-lowering effect compared to allopurinol, might be related to the CV result of our study. Taken together, it
is worth to examine in future studies whether uricosuric agents as a
class are favoured over XO inhibitors in terms of CV outcomes.
The null finding in the high-risk subgroup is likely in line with the
current window of opportunity concept for ULT.52 ULT was only
effective in lowering blood pressure during the acute phase but not
after a prolonged period of hyperuricaemia, at which stage, permanent structural vascular alteration occurred. Similarly, RCTs showed
that ULT (both XO inhibitors and uricosurics) was associated
with reduced blood pressure among adolescents but not among
adults.53-55 Alternatively, the CV effect of allopurinol vs. benzbromarone was relatively small as observed with the NNT and, thus,
could have disappeared in a high-risk subgroup in whom the CV
outcome was largely determined by the severity of their own CV
disease at baseline.
In this study, we unexpectedly found that allopurinol was associated with two-fold greater risk of non-CV mortality compared to
benzbromarone. Because our PS model was primarily designed to
serve CV outcomes, concerns for residual or unmeasured confounding exist with non-CV outcomes. Nevertheless, growing evidence
suggests that soluble uric acids induce adverse pathways in a wide
spectrum of cell types (e.g. vascular, adipose, endocrine, and immune)
when intracellularly transported via urate transporters.50,51,56-59
Coupled with the finding that majority of hyperuricaemia develops by
insufficient urate excretion than overproduction, one can postulate
that benzbromarone, compared to allopurinol, would provide intrinsic benefits by inhibiting adverse cellular response from tissues that
express urate transporters. Until the present, no other studies have
directly compared the effect of benzbromarone with allopurinol on
the risk of cause-specific mortality. While our results need to be confirmed, our study highlights a need for an RCT of benzbromarone on
CV events and all-cause mortality among gout patients.
When we investigated serious or fatal liver diseases that occurred
during benzbromarone treatment, we could find none attributable to
the drug in our patients, who used a dose of <_150 mg/day benzbromarone in >99% of cases.
This study has several important strengths. First, rigorous pharmacoepidemiologic methods were used including only the incident new
users and adopting active comparator design to minimize confounding by indication.60 We also performed extensive adjustment for >_60
covariates using PS matching. To further account for competing risk
of death, we used a cause-specific model to estimate the HR. In addition, we performed a follow-up time stratified analysis to avoid bias
due to different follow-up times between the two treatment groups.
Second, this study provides high generalizability based on the nationally representative database used. Third, our analyses on secondary
outcomes and also ITT analyses showed overall consistent results as
with the primary analyses. Fourth, we looked at covariate balance
during the post-index period to ensure that the balance was overall
preserved during the follow-up. Finally, we utilized previously validated claims-based algorithms to define CV outcomes to minimize
misclassification bias.29-31
There are limitations in this study. First, our cohort study is inevitably subject to residual or unmeasured confounding, despite our
rigorous efforts for confounding adjustment. Although we have

the genetic determinants for hyperuricaemia and/or gout are primarily linked to disturbed urate excretion.42 Therefore, the role of intracellular XO activity regarding the increased CV risk among gout
patients is less compelling than hyperuricaemia itself.
The urate-lowering efficacy of 100 mg/day benzbromarone is
known to be superior to that of 300 mg/day allopurinol,43 and 300-
380 mg/day allopurinol has a similar efficacy with 75-80 mg/day benzbromarone.44,45 Based on the known equipotent dose of the two
drugs, dosage use patterns, and PDC of the two drugs, it is likely that
a higher proportion of the benzbromarone group achieved target SU
levels <6.0 mg/dL during follow-up compared to the allopurinol
group. Although the previous CARES and FAST trials do not necessarily link a greater urate-lowering efficacy or lower average SU levels
with a better CV outcome,11,12 it is still worth to discuss whether
successful urate-lowering therapy (ULT) might relate to better CV
outcomes. The majority of CARES participants achieved target SU
levels of <6 mg/dL (61-75% of febuxostat users vs. 50-75% of allopurinol users), with similar proportions of target-achieving patients
between the two groups except for the first 2 weeks. Likewise, all of
FAST participants achieved the target SU levels through a lead-in
phase. Moreover, these trials did not include a placebo group.
Therefore, data are far limited even with the CARES and FAST trials
regarding whether ULT itself is effective in reducing CV risk. The
beneficial effects associated with benzbromarone vs. allopurinol in
our study may, in fact, be due to more effective urate-lowering treatment with benzbromarone. An ongoing large RCT comparing allopurinol (600 mg/day) vs. usual care, the ALL-HEART study, is awaited
to provide relevant information to this question in the future.
In addition to the upper bound of target SU levels, another important aspect of ULT would be the optimal lower bound, based on the Jshaped relationship between SU and CV events.9 Because the curve
inflection typically occurs at SU levels around 4-5 mg/dL,9 profound
uric acid decrease below such a level could be rather detrimental.
Considering the doses used by the majority of our PS-matched cohort (100-300 mg/day allopurinol, 50-150 mg/day benzbromarone),11,43 patients who experienced hazardously low SU levels were
likely infrequent in our study unlike the CARES and FAST.
In the recent US cohort study of elderly Medicare enrollees (mean
76 years of age, 54% male) that compared CV effect of XO inhibitor
vs. uricosuric agent, Kim et al.13 found an increased risk of non-fatal
CV events and all-cause mortality associated with allopurinol use vs.
probenecid. The baseline comorbidity of study participants was
higher (mean comorbidity score of 2.4) than ours and 28% had CV
disease already. The CV benefits with probenecid is thought to derive
from the direct and potent actions of probenecid on vascular and inflammatory process than urate-lowering effect.46-49 Similar to probenecid, benzbromarone also exhibits diverse CV actions.22-27,50,51
Among non-renal cells, vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells
are those that express urate transporters: benzbromarone prevented the activation of proliferative and inflammatory pathways
induced by intracellularly transported soluble uric acids in these
cells.50,51 Selective inhibition of phosphatase-transactivator protein
EYA by benzbromarone (or its metabolites) substantially reversed
vascular remodelling in a rat model of pulmonary arterial hypertension.26 In addition, benzbromarone selectively inhibits Ca2th-activated

balanced proxies of gout severity, direct test results on SU levels,
renal functions, or the severity of CV risk factors including hypertension, chronic kidney disease, or heart failure were not ascertainable
from the claims data. However, benzbromarone initiators showed a
higher prevalence of CV risk factors and greater comorbidity index at
baseline (Table 1), thus any residual confounding was likely to render
our results in favour of allopurinol than benzbromarone.
Nevertheless, the concern of residual or unmeasured confounding is
still present. In particular, those with highly advanced kidney disease
could have been more frequently included in the allopurinol group.
Second, we could not provide the mechanism to support reduced
risk of all-cause mortality associated with benzbromarone use than
allopurinol.
In conclusion, in this large population-based cohort study, we
found that allopurinol use was associated with an increased risk of
non-fatal CV events and all-cause mortality compared to benzbromarone. Benzbromarone may reduce CV risk and mortality in
patients with gout, although more studies are necessary to confirm
our findings and advance the understanding of the biological
mechanisms.
