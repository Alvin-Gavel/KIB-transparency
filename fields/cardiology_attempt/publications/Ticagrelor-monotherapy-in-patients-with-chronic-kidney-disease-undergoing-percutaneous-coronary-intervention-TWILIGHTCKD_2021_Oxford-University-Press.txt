Aims

The aim of this study was to assess the impact of chronic kidney disease (CKD) on the safety and efficacy of ticagrelor monotherapy among patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
In this prespecified subanalysis of the TWILIGHT trial, we evaluated the treatment effects of ticagrelor with or
without aspirin according to renal function. The trial enrolled patients undergoing drug-eluting stent implantation
and results
who fulfilled at least one clinical and one angiographic high-risk criterion. Chronic kidney disease, defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 mL/min/1.73 m2, was a clinical study entry criterion. Following a 3month period of ticagrelor plus aspirin, event-free patients were randomly assigned to aspirin or placebo on top of
ticagrelor for an additional 12 months. Of the 6835 patients randomized and with available eGFR at baseline, 1111
(16.3%) had CKD. Ticagrelor plus placebo reduced the primary endpoint of Bleeding Academic Research
Consortium (BARC) type 2, 3, or 5 bleeding as compared with ticagrelor plus aspirin in both patients with [4.6%
vs. 9.0%; hazard ratio (HR) 0.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.31-0.80] and without (4.0% vs. 6.7%; HR 0.59, 95%
CI 0.47-0.75; Pinteraction = 0.508) CKD, but the absolute risk reduction was greater in the former group. Rates of

Conclusion
Among CKD patients undergoing PCI, ticagrelor monotherapy reduced the risk of bleeding without a significant increase in ischaemic events as compared with ticagrelor plus aspirin.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                   

Graphical Abstract

Introduction
Impaired renal function is an established risk factor for incident and
recurrent coronary events with cardiovascular disease being the leading cause of death in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).1-3
The degree of CKD severity is associated with a progressive increase
in the risk of both thrombotic and bleeding complications.4-6 The
pathophysiology behind these observations is multifactorial and
relates to abnormalities of both platelet function and the coagulation
cascade. As a result, the clinical implications of antithrombotic therapies may be different in patients with CKD as compared to those
with normal renal function.7,8
A combination of aspirin and P2Y12 inhibitor, commonly
referred as dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), is the standard of
care after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Dual antiplatelet therapy effectively prevents ischaemic events, including stent
thrombosis, but at the cost of an increase in bleeding.9 Bleeding
complications have been shown to negatively correlate with

patient survival after PCI, thereby putting the ischaemic benefits of
DAPT in jeopardy.10-12 This risk-benefit trade-off is further
enhanced by more potent P2Y12 inhibitors (such as prasugrel and
ticagrelor), reflecting the incremental extent of platelet
inhibition.13
Recently, a strategy of ticagrelor monotherapy after a short course
of DAPT has emerged as an alternative treatment for high-risk
patients undergoing PCI. In the TWILIGHT (Ticagrelor With Aspirin
or Alone in High-Risk Patients after Coronary Intervention) trial, this
approach was shown to significantly reduce clinically relevant bleeding without compromising antithrombotic efficacy.14 It is unknown
whether the clinical benefits of ticagrelor monotherapy are preserved in patients with CKD undergoing PCI, who-being intrinsically
characterized by high thrombotic and bleeding risks-might particularly benefit from an optimization of antithrombotic strategies.
Therefore, we conducted a prespecified analysis of the TWILIGHT
trial to examine the safety and efficacy of ticagrelor monotherapy
according to renal function.

Methods
Trial design and oversight

Trial population
Patients undergoing successful PCI with at least one drug-eluting stent
were eligible if they had at least one clinical and one angiographic feature
associated with a high risk of ischaemic or bleeding events. Chronic
kidney disease, defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate
<60 mL/min/1.73 m2, was a clinical study entry criterion; other clinical criteria included age >_65 years, female sex, troponin positive acute coronary syndrome (ACS), atherosclerotic vascular disease [prior myocardial
infarction (MI), coronary revascularization or peripheral arterial disease],
and diabetes mellitus requiring medication. Angiographic criteria included
multivessel coronary artery disease, total stent length >30 mm, thrombotic target lesion, bifurcation lesion requiring two stents, obstructive left
main or proximal left anterior descending lesion, and calcified target lesion requiring debulking devices. Key exclusion criteria included dialysisdependent renal failure, presentation with ST-elevation MI, cardiogenic
shock, prior stroke, or need for oral anticoagulation.
All enrolled patients received open-label ticagrelor (90 mg twice daily)
and enteric-coated aspirin (81-100 mg daily) after the index PCI. At
3 months, patients without major bleeding or ischaemic events were
randomized 1:1 in a double-blind fashion to aspirin or matching placebo
for 12 months in addition to open-label ticagrelor. Patients who experienced Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) type 3b or
higher bleeds or ischaemic events (stroke, MI, or coronary revascularization) between the index PCI and 3 months were not eligible for randomization. Moreover, patients were ineligible for randomization if they were
non-adherent to ticagrelor or aspirin. Randomization was performed
using a secure web-based system; an independent statistician not involved
with the trial generated the allocation sequence, which was stratified by
site with randomly varying block sizes of 4, 6, or 8. Follow-up occurred
1 month after randomization via telephone and in-person at 6 and
12 months after randomization. After 12 months of protocol-mandated
therapy, patients were switched to a standard-of-care antiplatelet regimen at the discretion of their treating physician followed by final telephone follow-up 3 months later.

Endpoints
The primary endpoint was the composite of BARC type 2, 3, or 5 bleeding up to 1 year after randomization. The key secondary endpoint was
the composite of all-cause death, MI, or stroke. Secondary bleeding endpoints included BARC types 3 or 5 bleeding; Thrombolysis in Myocardial
Infarction (TIMI) major or minor bleeding; Global Use of Strategies to
Open Occluded Arteries (GUSTO) moderate, severe, or life-threatening
bleeding; or major bleeding as defined by the International Society on
Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH).16-19 Other secondary endpoints

.. included cardiovascular death, non-fatal MI, ischaemic stroke, and definite
..
.. or probable stent thrombosis. MI was defined according to the third uni.. versal definition, and revascularization and stent thrombosis were classi..
.. fied according to the Academic Research Consortium.20,21 All clinical
.. events were adjudicated by an independent committee, blinded to treat.. ment assignment.
..
..
.. Renal function assessment
..
.. Laboratory tests were performed locally at each site and collected during
.. the enrolment procedure. Renal function was assessed using the most re..
.. cent value of serum creatinine preceding index PCI, up to 4 weeks before.
.. Glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was estimated according to the
..
Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equa.. Chronic
.. tion.22 The prespecified eGFR cut-point to define CKD was <60 mL/min/
.. 1.73 m2. The Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative of the National
..
.. Kidney Foundation classification was used to further stratify patients into
.. mild to moderate (stage 3a: eGFR 45-59 mL/min/1.73 m2) or moderate
.. to severe CKD (stage >_3b: eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2).23
..
..
.. Statistical analyses
..
.. Baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes were evaluated in relation
.. to renal function. In the primary prespecified analysis, the treatment
..
.. effects of ticagrelor monotherapy vs. ticagrelor plus aspirin were eval.. uated in patients with CKD (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2) and without
..
.. CKD (eGFR >_ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2), with formal interaction testing to as.. sess for effect modification. Patients with unknown eGFR were excluded
.. from the analysis. Clinical and procedural features are summarized by
..
.. CKD status and randomized group using means (standard deviation) and
.. frequencies for continuous and categorical variables, respectively. The cu..
.. mulative incidence of primary and secondary endpoints was estimated
.. using the Kaplan-Meier method. Patients without a primary endpoint be.. tween randomization and 1 year after randomization were censored at
..
.. the time of death, last known contact, or 365 days, whichever came first.
.. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were generated
.. using Cox proportional hazards models.
..
..
Exploratory analyses were performed to examine the effects of tica.. grelor monotherapy in the following clinically relevant subgroups within
..
.. the CKD cohort: age (>_65 vs. <65 years), sex (male vs. female), body
.. mass index (above vs. below median), non-ST-segment elevation ACS in..
.. dication for PCI, prior MI, diabetes mellitus, anaemia, and multivessel dis.. ease. Clinical outcomes were also evaluated according to the degree of
.. CKD severity using eGFR as a three-level categorical variable (<45, 45-
..
.. 59, and >_60 mL/min/1.73 m2). In addition, cubic splines fitted with four
.. equally spaced knots were used to plot the 1-year rate of ischaemic and
..
.. bleeding events according to eGFR as a continuous variable in the overall
.. population and in the two treatment arms, separately. For all analyses,
.. bleeding outcomes were assessed in the intention-to-treat cohort, while
..
.. ischaemic outcomes were analysed using the per-protocol cohort. A
.. two-sided P-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. All

TWILIGHT was a randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted at 187
sites in 11 countries from July 2015 through July 2019. The trial rationale,
design, and principal results have been reported previously.15 TWILIGHT
was designed, coordinated, and sponsored by The Icahn School of
Medicine at Mount Sinai. AstraZeneca provided an investigator-initiated
grant and supplied ticagrelor for the trial but had no role in the design,
collection, analysis, or interpretation of the data. The executive and steering committees were responsible for trial conduct, integrity of data analysis, and reporting of results. National regulatory agencies and
institutional review boards or ethics committees of participating centres
approved the trial protocol. An independent data safety monitoring
board provided external oversight to ensure the safety of trial
participants.

and procedural characteristics of patients with and without CKD are
summarized in Supplementary material online, Tables S1 and S2.
Baseline characteristics were balanced across treatment groups, except for a lower prevalence of female sex (27.8% vs. 34.6%;
P = 0.014) and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (32.7% vs. 42.6%;
P = 0.020) in CKD patients receiving ticagrelor plus placebo and a
lower prevalence of smokers (22.0% vs. 25.1%; P = 0.006) in patients
without CKD receiving ticagrelor plus placebo, respectively, compared with those on ticagrelor plus aspirin (Table 1). There were no
significant differences in procedural characteristics between randomized treatment groups (Table 2).
In the cohort of CKD patients, adherence to ticagrelor at 1 year
was similar among those randomized to ticagrelor plus placebo compared with ticagrelor plus aspirin (80.5% vs. 83.0%; P = 0.288).
Corresponding rates of adherence to blinded study drug were 74.7%
and 78.7%, respectively (P = 0.110). Among patients without CKD,
adherence rates to ticagrelor were higher in the placebo group
(88.6% vs. 86.6%; P = 0.025), while there were no significant differences with respect to study drug (84.7% vs. 83.0%; P = 0.087).

placebo vs. 31 patients (5.7%) randomized to ticagrelor plus aspirin
(HR 1.40, 95% CI 0.88-2.22; P = 0.153) for an absolute risk difference
of 2.2% (95% CI -0.8 to 5.2%) (Figure 3). Individual rates of MI (5.0%
vs. 3.9%), ischaemic stroke (0.9% vs 0.0%), and definite/probable stent
thrombosis (0.9% vs. 0.6%) were numerically higher with ticagrelor
plus placebo but not significantly different between treatment groups,
with the exception of ischaemic stroke (P = 0.025) (Figure 4). Similar
treatment effects on ischaemic events were observed in patients
without CKD for the composite of all-cause death, MI, or stroke
(3.2% vs. 3.6%; absolute risk difference -0.4%, 95% CI -1.3% to 0.6%;
HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.68-1.20; P = 0.477) and other secondary endpoints, with no significant interaction between CKD status and treatment arm (all Pinteraction > 0.1).

Exploratory analyses
Ticagrelor monotherapy reduced the risk of BARC 2, 3, or 5 bleeding
without any increase in death, MI, or stroke across different subgroups of CKD patients, with no evidence of effect modification
driven by the presence of additional risk features (Supplementary material online, Table S3 and S4).
Of the 1111 patients with an eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2, 796
(71.6%) had mild-to-moderate CKD (eGFR 45-59 mL/min/1.73 m2)
while 315 (28.4%) had moderate-to-severe CKD (eGFR <
45 mL/min/1.73 m2). There was a graded relationship between the
severity of CKD and the risk of bleeding and ischaemic events (Sup
plementary material online, Figure S3), but the treatment effects of
ticagrelor monotherapy on the primary and key secondary endpoints
were preserved across all CKD categories (Supplementary material
online, Tables S5 and S6).

When the estimated event rates were plotted against eGFR used
as a continuous variable, the absolute risk reduction in BARC 2, 3, or
5 bleeding with ticagrelor monotherapy progressively increased
with worsening renal function (Supplementary material online, Figure
S4A). Meanwhile, the rates of death, MI, or stroke were numerically
lower with ticagrelor monotherapy compared with ticagrelor
plus aspirin for eGFR values >80 mL/min/1.73 m2 and numerically
higher below the same eGFR cut-off (Supplementary material online,
Figure S4B).

Discussion
The principal findings from this prespecified subgroup analysis of the
TWILIGHT trial suggest that the treatment effects of ticagrelor
monotherapy on bleeding and ischaemic outcomes observed in the
overall trial are preserved irrespective of CKD. Of note, withdrawing
aspirin after 3 months of DAPT with ticagrelor reduced clinically relevant BARC 2, 3, or 5 bleeding and major BARC 3 or 5 bleeding by
50% and 60%, respectively, among patients with CKD. This translated
into an absolute reduction in bleeding risk more pronounced in
patients with CKD than in those without CKD. Furthermore, ticagrelor monotherapy, as compared with ticagrelor plus aspirin, was not
associated with significant differences in the composite outcome of
all-cause death, MI, or stroke, despite a numerical increase in the
rates of ischaemic events with worsening renal function (Graphical
abstract).

progressive ageing of the general population as well as the broadening of the indications to PCI to higher risk cohorts. The increased
haemorrhagic and thrombotic risk profile of patients with CKD
has been extensively characterized, with clinical studies demonstrating a gradient in the rates of adverse events that parallels the
degree of renal dysfunction.4-6 Several homeostatic modifications,
including impaired platelet-vessel interaction, platelet aggregation
and secretion abnormalities, and a pro-coagulant state with higher
levels of fibrinogen and tissue factor and reduced anti-thrombin
activity, have been implicated in these clinical manifestations.24
Accelerated atherosclerosis, systemic inflammation, and oxidative
stress are other key contributors to the enhanced cardiovascular risk
associated with CKD.25,26 Additional pharmacological issues relating
to altered pharmacodynamic response, drug accumulation, and modified drug interactions further compound the management of these
patients.7,8
In the early era of DAPT, subgroup analyses from randomized trials suggested that the benefits of adjunctive therapy with clopidogrel
over aspirin alone were attenuated in patients with renal dysfunction.27,28 Similar findings were reported in those with diabetic nephropathy randomized to monotherapy with clopidogrel instead of
aspirin for secondary cardiovascular prevention.29 This apparent lack
of benefit was partly attributed to the higher levels of platelet reactivity observed in patients with CKD during treatment with clopidogrel,
thus providing a rationale for the use of alternative antithrombotic
regimens in this cohort.30,31

Compared with clopidogrel, potent P2Y12 inhibitors (prasugrel
and ticagrelor) have demonstrated a significant benefit in terms of ischaemic protection among ACS patients, including those with eGFR
<60 mL/min/1.73 m2. In the PLATO trial, the absolute and relative
risk reduction for the primary endpoint of death, MI, or stroke associated with ticagrelor was enhanced in patients with CKD, although significant interaction with renal function was only achieved in a
sensitivity analysis with the MDRD (Modification of Diet in Renal
Disease) equation.32 Yet, the incremental antithrombic efficacy of
ticagrelor over clopidogrel was evaluated on a background aspirin
therapy, and this treatment combination also generated a remarkable
increase in severe bleeding, which is known to negatively affect survival to a similar extent as thrombotic events.11,12
The idea that withdrawing aspirin after a short course of DAPT
could reduce bleeding without compromising antithrombotic efficacy
upon continuation of ticagrelor alone recently started to emerge.33
This approach was also supported by pharmacodynamic data suggesting a marginal antiplatelet effect of aspirin when added to potent
P2Y12 inhibitors.34,35 Hence, a number of PCI trials have investigated
the safety and efficacy of P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy after a DAPT
course as short as 1-3 months.36-39 In GLOBAL LEADERS, which
randomized nearly 16 000 all-comer patients to ticagrelor monotherapy after 1-month DAPT vs. standard of care, the prevalence of CKD
was 13.7%.40 The trial results showed no significant differences in the
primary endpoint of all-cause mortality or new Q-wave MI and
BARC 3 or 5 bleeding at 2 years between the experimental and the

on the ischaemic endpoints in relation to CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2). Event rates at 1 year were estimated using
the Kaplan-Meier method. Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) with interaction P-values generated using Cox regression. In the CKD cohort, the stroke rate was 0.9% (five events) in patients randomized to ticagrelor plus placebo vs. 0% (no events) in those randomized to ticagrelor
plus aspirin (log-rank P = 0.025, hazard ratio not applicable); Corresponding stroke rates in patients without CKD were 0.4% (11 events) vs. 0.3% (8
events) (log-rank P = 0.481; hazard ratio 1.38; 95% CI 0.55-3.43). ASA, aspirin; CI, confidence interval; CKD, chronic kidney disease; CV, cardiovascular, HR, hazard ratio; MI, myocardial infarction, ST, stent thrombosis, Tica, ticagrelor.

control strategy, irrespective of renal function.40 While these findings
must be interpreted in the context of an overall negative trial, exploratory analyses using eGFR as a continuous variable suggested a
lower bleeding risk with ticagrelor monotherapy with decreasing
eGFR, consistent with what reported in the present analysis.
Compared to GLOBAL LEADERS, however, the TWILIGHT trial
enrolled patients enriched with clinical and angiographic features of
high risk for bleeding or ischaemia. Chronic kidney disease, an established risk factor for both these types of events, represented a clinical
study entry criterion. Most of the available risk scores developed in
PCI cohorts identify CKD as a qualifying condition to define patients
as high bleeding risk.41-43 Building on this prior evidence, our results
support the relevance of CKD when evaluating the bleeding-related
benefits of an aspirin withdrawal strategy. The absolute and relative
bleeding risk reductions that we observed were larger than in other
trials evaluating a similar treatment regimen and underscore the importance of implementing bleeding-avoidance strategies in such vulnerable cohorts.
It is also noteworthy that, in TWILIGHT, the reduction in bleeding
risk was not counterbalanced by a trade-off in antithrombotic efficacy
with ticagrelor monotherapy. Nonetheless, there was a numerical increase in ischaemic events among CKD patients on ticagrelor monotherapy, mainly driven by an excess in stroke rates. Such trend,
although not statistically significant, was also suggested by visual assessment of the relationship between ischaemic event rates and
eGFR used as a continuous variable. Whether aspirin serves an important platelet inhibitory role in the prothrombotic milieu of CKD,
however, remains unproven. Hence, while these data seem to reassure on both the safety and efficacy of ticagrelor monotherapy after
PCI among CKD patients, the limited sample size of our subgroup
