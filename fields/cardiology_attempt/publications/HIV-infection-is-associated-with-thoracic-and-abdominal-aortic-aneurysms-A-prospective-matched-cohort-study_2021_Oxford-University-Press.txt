Aims

Little is known about the prevalence of aortic aneurysms among people living with HIV (PLWH). We investigated
whether HIV status is independently associated with having aortic aneurysms. Furthermore, we determined risk factors associated with aortic aneurysms in PLWH.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
PLWH aged >_40 years (n = 594) were recruited from the Copenhagen Comorbidity in HIV Infection study and
matched for age and sex with uninfected controls (n = 1188) from the Copenhagen General Population Study.
and results

Aortic dimensions were assessed using contrast enhanced computed tomography. Aortic aneurysms were defined
according to the European Society of Cardiology guidelines, i.e. an aortic dilation of >_50% or an infrarenal aortic
diameter of >_30 mm. Among PLWH and uninfected controls, the median (interquartile range) age was 52 (47-60)
and 52 (48-61) and 88% and 90% were male, respectively. We found 46 aneurysms in 42 (7.1%) PLWH and 31
aneurysms in 29 (2.4%) uninfected controls (P < 0.001). PLWH had a significantly higher prevalence of ascending
aortic aneurysms and infrarenal aortic aneurysms. In an adjusted model, HIV was independently associated with
aortic aneurysms (adjusted odds ratio; 4.51 [95% confidence interval 2.56-8.08], P < 0.001). Within PLWH, obesity
and hepatitis B co-infection were associated with aortic aneurysms.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
PLWH had four-fold higher odds of aortic aneurysms compared to uninfected controls, and HIV status was inde-

pendently associated with aortic aneurysms. Among PLWH, age, obesity and hepatitis B co-infection were associated with higher odds of aortic aneurysms. Our findings suggest that increased attention to aortic aneurysms in
PLWH may be beneficial.

Introduction
The introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy has dramatically improved the prognosis for people living with HIV (PLWH), but
long-term survival remains lower among PLWH than among uninfected individuals.1 This is partly explained by an increased incidence
of cardiovascular disease (CVD),2 and PLWH has been reported to
be twice as likely to develop atherosclerotic CVD compared to the
general population.2,3
Aortic aneurysms are pathological dilatations of an aortic segment with a diameter >_50% greater than normal.4 Aortic aneurysms are divided into thoracic aortic aneurysms and abdominal
aortic aneurysms. When ruptured, abdominal aortic aneurysms
have a mortality rate of around 80%,5 whereas unruptured aneurysms generally are asymptomatic and in most cases diagnosed incidentally.4 Screening of high-risk populations such as men aged
>65 years is recommended.6 Known risk factors for abdominal
aortic aneurysms include age, male sex, smoking, family history of
abdominal aortic aneurysms, atherosclerosis, hypercholesterolaemia, and hypertension.4,7,8 Thoracic aortic aneurysms have been
associated with hypertension, bicuspid aortic valves and genetic
risk factors.6 Several of these risk factors are common among

PLWH.9-11 Furthermore, a high proportion of PLWH in Europe
and Northern America are men who have sex with men,12 who
are disproportionally burdened with syphilis infections.13,14 Syphilis
may also constitute a risk factor, especially for thoracic aortic
aneurysms.15,16 In addition to being associated with several risk factors for aortic aneurysms, HIV infection has been associated with
cerebral aneurysmal vasculopathy.17
Although PLWH are at higher risk of CVD in general and may
have several risk factors for aortic aneurysms, the burden of aortic aneurysms in PLWH is unknown, and no previous study has
investigated whether HIV is a risk factor for aortic aneurysms.
We aimed to determine the prevalence of aortic aneurysms
among well-treated PLWH and uninfected controls using contrast
enhanced computed tomography (CT).18 Furthermore, we aimed
to determine whether HIV is independently associated with prevalence of aortic aneurysms and to determine traditional, as well as
HIV-specific risk factors, for aortic aneurysms among PLWH. We
hypothesized that HIV would be independently associated with
higher odds of aortic aneurysms. In addition, we hypothesized
that traditional, as well as HIV-specific risk factors including previous or current syphilis infection, would be associated with higher
odds of aortic aneurysms among PLWH.

Methods
Study design and population

Clinical characteristics and self-reported
outcomes
A physical examination including anthropometrics and blood pressure
measurements was performed by trained clinical staff using identical
standard operating procedures in COCOMO and CGPS. Identical questionnaires were used to collect information regarding smoking, medical
history, and medication. Non-fasting venous blood samples were collected and analysed for plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein
(hsCRP), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), glucose, and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c). LDL-C was calculated using the Friedewald
equation,22 unless triglycerides were >4 mmol/L, and then LDL-C was
measured directly. All blood samples from both COCOMO and CGPS
participants were analysed in the same laboratory at Copenhagen
University Hospital Herlev.19 Furthermore, plasma concentration of
interleukin-6 (IL-6) was measured using magnetic multiplex assay kits
from R&D systems at the Department of Clinical Immunology,
Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.
Data regarding HIV infection, such as mode of transmission, duration
of HIV infection, type of antiretroviral therapy, and syphilis serology,
were obtained from reviews of medical charts. All PLWH underwent annual screening for syphilis.
Active syphilis was defined as a combined positive screening nontreponemal test and a positive treponemal confirmatory test for previously uninfected and/or a four-fold or greater increase in titre of rapid plasma

.. reagin. Prior syphilis was defined as positive treponemal test with negative
..
.. rapid plasma reagin at time of CT scan.
..
We defined hypertension as current use of antihypertensive treatment
..
.. and/or systolic blood pressure >_140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pres.. sure >_90 mmHg.23 Elevated LDL-C was defined as LDL-C >_ 160 mg/dL
..
.. (4.14 mM) and/or current lipid-lowering treatment.24 Diabetes was
.. defined as non-fasting plasma glucose >_11.1 mmol/L (>_200 mg/dL) and/
.. or HbA1c >_48 mmol/mol (6.5%) and/or antidiabetic treatment. Body
..
.. mass index (BMI) was defined according to the World Health
.. Organization classification (<18.5 kg/m2 underweight, 18.5-24.99 kg/m2
..
.. normal weight, 25-29.99 kg/m2 overweight, and >_30 kg/m2 obese).25
.. Normal weight was used as reference. Injecting drug use (IDU) was
.. defined as self-reported IDU. Hepatitis C virus co-infection was defined
..
.. as positive hepatitis C virus RNA, and hepatitis B virus co-infection was
.. defined as a positive hepatitis B virus surface-antigen. Cytomegalovirus
..
.. status was defined according to cytomegalovirus-IgG. Low-grade26inflam.. mation was defined as hsCRP >1.39 mg/L as previously described.
..
..
.. CTexaminations
..
.. CT examinations were performed with a 320-detector CT scanner
.. (Aquilion ONE, ViSION Edition, Canon Medical Systems, Otawara,
..
.. Japan) at Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, using a uniform
.. protocol for COCOMO and CGPS participants. Scanner settings were
.. as follows: gantry rotation time 350 ms and detector collimation 0.5 
..
.. 320. Choice of tube voltage (100-120 kV) and current (280-500 mA)
.. were based according to BMI.27 An intravenous contrast agent (Visipaque
..
.. 78 mL, 320 mg/mL) was infused with a flow rate of 5 mL/s followed by a
.. saline chaser. First, a contrast enhanced thoracic angiography CT was
.. performed using a region of interest set in the descending aorta with an
..
.. automatic trigger-point at 250 Hounsfield units. Second, after a 10-s
.. delay, the abdominal CT was performed. The thoracic contrast enhanced
..
.. phase was reconstructed with a 0.5-mm slice thickness and increments of
.. 0.25 mm. The abdominal contrast enhanced phase was reconstructed
.. with a 3.0-mm slice thickness and increments of 3.0 mm.
..
..
..
.. Aortic analyses
.. On contrast-enhanced CT images, aortic diameters were measured at
..
.. multiple anatomical points of the aorta, including the ascending aorta,
.. descending aorta, aorta at the level of the coeliac trunk, and the infrarenal
.. abdominal aorta as previously described.27 All regional aortic measure..
.. ments were performed perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the
.. aorta. Analyses of all CT images from both COCOMO and CGPS were
..
.. performed using imaging analysis software (Vitrea Fx, version 6.9; Vital
.. Images Inc., MN, USA) on dedicated workstations by two experienced
.. readers (J.H. and M.H.C.P.) blinded to clinical characteristics, but not to
..
.. HIV status. A non-biased third-party reader would determine the out.. come in case of disagreement between the two readers. Inter- and intra..
.. observer variability of the aortic measurements was previously reported
.. and had a mean coefficient of variation of 2.8% and 2.4% at the ascending
.. aorta, 5.6% and 2.8% at the descending aorta, 4.2% and 5.5% at suprarenal
..
.. aorta, and 5.1% and 3.1% at infrarenal aorta.27

The Copenhagen Comorbidity in HIV Infection (COCOMO) study is a
non-interventional, cohort study with the aim of assessing the burden
of non-AIDS comorbidities in PLWH. Inclusion criteria were a positive
HIV test and age >18 years. Between March 2015 and December
2016, the COCOMO study included 1099 participants, all living in the
greater Copenhagen area. The procedures for recruitment and data
collection have been described in detail elsewhere.19 All participants of
COCOMO were offered a combined thoracic and abdominal CT
examination; CT examinations were performed from the study start in
spring 2015 until November 2016. A total of 720 COCOMO participants had a contrast enhanced CT performed, of these 594
were 40 years or older. An overview of COCOMO participants
40 years or older with contrast enhanced CT vs. COCOMO participants without contrast enhanced CT is shown in Supplementary material online, Table S1. Participants with estimated glomerular filtration
rate <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 or chronic kidney disease were excluded
due to risk associated with the use of contrast.
Uninfected controls were included from the Copenhagen General
Population Study (CGPS), a non-interventional longitudinal study, including >110 000 participants residing in the greater Copenhagen area of
whom >10 000 have had a combined thoracic and abdominal CT examination performed between 2010 and 2019.20 As only CGPS participants
older than 40 years were offered a CT examination, only COCOMO participants older than 40 years, with a contrast enhanced CT of both thorax
and abdomen (n = 594), were matched by age and sex (in a 1:2 ratio) to
participants in CGPS, with a contrast enhanced CT of both thorax and
abdomen (n = 6380). Matching was performed using propensity score
matching and the R-package 'MatchIt21'.
Ethical approval was obtained by the Regional Ethical Committee of
Copenhagen (COCOMO: H-8-2014-004; CGPS: H-KF-01-144/01). The
study was performed in accordance with the principles of the
Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from all
participants.

classified as either fusiform, concentric saccular, or eccentric saccular by
both readers. Furthermore, both readers evaluated if the aortic aneurysms had calcification. Participants with aneurysms meeting the clinical
threshold for surgical repair according to the Danish and European guidelines6,30 were referred for clinical evaluation.

Statistics
The sample size was based on a priori power calculations. Assuming a
prevalence of aortic aneurysms in the general population of 4%, inclusion
of 650 PLWH and 1300 controls in a 1:2 matching would have allowed us
to show an odds ratio (OR) of 1.8 with a power of 0.8 (a = 0.05). The
number of PLWH aged >_40 years with contrast enhanced CT imaging
was slightly lower than anticipated. With 594 PLWH and 1188 uninfected
controls, we were able to show an OR of 1.9 with a power (1 - b) of 0.8
(a = 0.05).
Power calculations were performed using the epiR package31 in R and
assuming two-tailed P-values.
Descriptive statistical analyses were used to assess demographics, risk
factors, and physical measurements. Groups were compared using t-test
or Mann-Whitney U test for continuous data and v2 tests or Fisher's
exact test for categorical data. Continuous data were reported with
means and standard deviations for normal deviates and medians with
interquartile ranges (IQR) for variables not normally distributed as appropriate. For categorical data, frequency counts and percentage were
reported.
We investigated the association between HIV and aortic aneurysms
using simple and multivariable logistic regression. We used a predefined
model and adjusted for age, sex, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, origin,
smoking status (previous/current/never smoker), and BMI category.
Analyses were performed as patient-level analysis, and aortic aneurysm in

the model was defined as the number of participants with aortic
aneurysms.
Within PLWH, we investigated the association between traditional
risk factors (age, sex, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, origin, smoking status and BMI category) as well as HIV-specific risk factors (CD4th, CD4th/
CD8th ratio, viral load >50 copies/mL, nadir CD4th <200 cells/mL, years
with HIV infection, years on combined antiretroviral therapy, use of protease inhibitors, use of integrase inhibitors, use of nucleoside/nucleotide
reverse transcriptase inhibitors, use of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, previous or current syphilis, previous AIDS defining condition, or IDU) and aortic aneurysms in a model adjusted for age, sex,
hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, origin, smoking status, and BMI category.
In addition, within uninfected controls we investigated the association between traditional risk factors and aortic aneurysms using the same predefined model.
In exploratory analyses, we determined the prevalence of abdominal
aortic aneurysms among men 65 years or older, who are considered a
high-risk population. Additionally, interaction between HIV and ageing
was tested in our predefined multivariable model with aortic aneurysms
as the dependent variable. The association between HIV and the aortic
aneurysm wall thickness was investigated for each anatomic site separately using linear regression adjusting for our predefined model.
In further exploratory analyses, we investigated the association between hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, cytomegalovirus, cumulative
pack years of smoking, IL-6, and hsCRP >1.39 mg/L and aortic aneurysms
in PLWH adjusting for the predefined multivariable model described
above.
In sensitivity analysis of participants with European origin, we investigated the association between HIV and aortic aneurysms using multivariable logistic regression adjusting for age, sex, hypertension,
hyperlipidaemia, smoking status (previous/current/never smoker), and
BMI category. In another sensitivity analysis we investigated the association between HIV and aortic aneurysms in a multivariable model including important confounders as continuous measures. Accordingly, we
included age, BMI, systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure as continuous measures and sex, smoking status, antihypertensive treatment, hyperlipidaemia, and origin as categorical measures.
A P-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. All P-values
were two-sided. Missing data were excluded from the calculations by
casewise/listwise deletion (Supplementary material online, Tables S2 and
S3). All statistical analyses were conducted using R Statistics 3.6.1 (R
Core Team, Vienna, Austria).32 Figures were made using R ggplot2.33

Results
Of 1099 PLWH included in the COCOMO study, 720 had a contrast
enhanced CT performed. Of these, 594 were older than 40 years and
included along with 1188 matched, uninfected controls.
Characteristics of the participants are listed in Table 1 and HIVrelated variables are listed in Table 2. The median (IQR) age for
PLWH and uninfected controls was 52 (47-60) and 52 (48-61), respectively. The majority of PLWH (87%) and all uninfected controls
(100%) were of European origin. Among PLWH, 587 (98.8%) were
on antiretroviral therapy and median (IQR) time since HIV diagnosis
was 15 (8-23) years. At the time of CT, 9 (2%) PLWH had current
syphilis infection and 195 (33%) had previous syphilis infection.
An overview of missing demographic and clinical variables is given
in Supplementary material online, Table S2.

Prevalence of aortic aneurysms in PLWH
and uninfected controls
We found 46 aneurysms in 42 (7.1%) PLWH and 31 aneurysms in
29 (2.4%) uninfected controls (P < 0.001). In our study, two PLWH
were referred for clinical evaluation, even though their aneurysms
did not meet the surgical threshold. One of these participants was
later operated due to an ascending aortic aneurysm and a bicuspid
aortic valve. There were four cases of bicuspid aortic valves, two
among PLWH and two among the uninfected controls. All observed
aortic aneurysms in both groups were in males. An overview of missing aortic measurements is given in Supplementary material online,
Table S3. The distribution of aortic aneurysms is listed in Table 3.
PLWH had a higher prevalence of ascending, suprarenal, and infrarenal aortic aneurysms, but not of descending aortic aneurysms, than
uninfected controls. In PLWH, we found 23% (n = 3) of infrarenal
aortic aneurysms to be concentric saccular and in uninfected controls, we found 17% (n = 1) of infrarenal aortic aneurysms to be concentric saccular. All other aortic aneurysms were classified as
fusiform (Supplementary material online, Table S4). We found no

significant difference in classification of aneurysms between PLWH
and uninfected controls.
When investigating calcification of the aortic aneurysms, we found
100% of infrarenal aortic aneurysms, 26% of suprarenal aortic aneurysms, and 0% of ascending aortic aneurysms to have calcification
(Supplementary material online, Table S4).
The prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysms (suprarenal and infrarenal abdominal aneurysms) among men in different age groups is
listed in Table 4. For men older than the recommended screening
threshold (>65 years of age), suprarenal and infrarenal aortic aneurysms were the most frequent aneurysms among both PLWH and uninfected controls. The prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysms was
13 (18.1%) among PLWH (n = 72) and 14 (8.6%) among the uninfected controls (n = 163).

Risk factors associated with aortic
aneurysms in PLWH and uninfected
controls
The crude OR of aortic aneurysms among PLWH compared to uninfected controls was 3.04 (95% CI 1.87-4.93; P < 0.001) (Figure 1). In a
multivariable model adjusted for age, sex, BMI category, smoking status, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia and origin, the adjusted OR (aOR)
of aortic aneurysms among PLWH compared to uninfected controls
was 4.51 (95% CI 2.56-8.08; P < 0.001) (Figure 1, Graphical abstract).
The association between HIV and aortic aneurysms was similar
across age groups (P-interaction = 0.503).
The median (IQR) ascending aortic aneurysm wall thickness was
2.6 mm (2.4-2.9) in PLWH and 2.1 mm (2.0-2.3) in uninfected controls (P = 0.010). For suprarenal aortic aneurysms, median (IQR) wall
thickness was 2.6 mm (2.3-3.3) in PLWH and 2.3 mm (2.2-2.8) in uninfected controls (P = 0.409), and for infrarenal aortic aneurysms median (IQR) wall thickness was 3.0 mm (2.6-7.1) in PLWH and 1.9 mm
(1.7-2.0) in uninfected controls (P = 0.027). When investigating the
association between HIV and wall thickness of aortic aneurysms,
using linear regression models, we found PLWH to have significantly
thicker aortic walls in ascending aortic aneurysms (0.62 mm, [95% CI
0.26-0.97], P = 0.008). However, HIV infection was not associated
with suprarenal and infrarenal aortic aneurysm wall thickness.
In a sensitivity analysis, we investigated the association between
HIV and aortic aneurysms among participants of European origin
(PLWH: n = 508, uninfected controls: n = 1188). In a multivariable
model, the aOR of aortic aneurysms among European PLWH compared to European uninfected controls was 4.58 (95% CI 2.57-8.14;
P < 0.001). Additionally, in another sensitivity analysis, we investigated
the association between HIV and aortic aneurysms in a multivariable
model adjusted for important confounders as continuous measures,
and found HIV to be associated with an increased OR of 5.60 (95%
CI 2.55-12.31; P < 0.001) of aortic aneurysms compared to uninfected controls.

Risk factors associated with aortic
aneurysms in PLWH
In analyses restricted to PLWH, traditional risk factors associated
with aortic aneurysms included age (aOR 3.25 per decade, 95% CI
2.13-4.95; P < 0.001) and obesity (aOR 5.12, 95% CI 1.44-18.24;
P = 0.012). Hypertension, smoking status, cumulative pack years,

origin, and hyperlipidaemia were not associated with aortic aneurysms in PLWH. In the analysis investigating the association between
traditional risk factors and aortic aneurysms within uninfected controls, only age (aOR 2.38 per decade, 95% CI 1.58-3.61; P < 0.001)
was associated with aortic aneurysms.
When investigating HIV-specific risk factors, only co-infection with
hepatitis B virus was associated with higher odds of aortic aneurysms
(aOR 5.57, 95% CI 1.47-21.12; P = 0.012). Other HIV-specific risk
factors including previous or current syphilis, years with HIV infection, years on combination antiretroviral therapy, co-infection with
hepatitis C virus, IDU, IL-6, hsCRP >1.39 mg/L, viral load >50 copies/
mL, and nadir CD4th <200 copies cells/mL were not associated with
aortic aneurysms. An overview of the association between clinical
and demographic variables and specific anatomic aneurysm sites is
given in Supplementary material online, Table S5.

Discussion
In a large cohort of PLWH and uninfected controls, PLWH had a
higher prevalence of aortic aneurysms, and HIV status was independently associated with 4.51 (95% CI 2.56-8.08) higher odds of aortic
aneurysms after adjusting for traditional risk factors. In addition, age,
obesity, and co-infection with hepatitis B virus were significantly associated with higher odds of aortic aneurysms among PLWH. Other
traditional and HIV-specific risk factors including syphilis were not
found. Our findings suggest that HIV infection is an independent risk
factor for aortic aneurysms.
The prevalence of aortic aneurysms in uninfected men aged 65-
74 years was comparable to that in the larger DANCAVAS study.29
In our study, uninfected men aged >_65 years had a slightly higher
prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysms of 8.6%, but men with HIV
aged >_65 years had a prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysms that
was two times higher than that. A similar prevalence was found
among men with HIV who were around 15 years their junior (Table

4). We found infrarenal aortic aneurysms to be more frequent in persons aged >_65 years in both PLWH and uninfected controls, a finding
that is consistent with the general understanding of infrarenal aortic
aneurysms being a regenerative disease of ageing. Screening for aortic
aneurysms in men aged >_65 years is recommended.6 Furthermore, in
men aged 65 years with a subaneurysmal abdominal aortic diameter
(23-29 mm), 28% may develop an abdominal aortic aneurysm larger
than the clinical threshold for surgery (>_55 mm) within 15 years.34
Accordingly, even though the vast majority of PLWH had aneurysms
below the surgical threshold, it is likely that some of the PLWH will
need surgical repair at some point. As we found a higher prevalence
of abdominal aortic aneurysms among male PLWH aged 65 years and
screening of men aged >_65 years is considered cost beneficial,35,36
our findings suggest that screening for aortic aneurysms in PLWH
may also be beneficial. This should be investigated in larger prospective trials with clinical endpoints.
When investigating traditional risk factors for aortic aneurysm,
only age and obesity were found to be associated with aortic aneurysms. The Physicians' Health Study has previously described obesity
as a significant risk factor for abdominal aortic aneurysms37 and in
Danish subjects body size has been closely associated with aortic
diameter.27 Furthermore, age is a well-described risk factor for aortic
aneurysms.7,29 Accordingly, we found the risk of aortic aneurysms to
increase with age both among PLWH and uninfected controls.
Smoking and hypertension are also considered risk factors for aortic
aneurysms.4,7 We did not find either to be associated with aneurysms
in PLWH. However, 37% of PLWH with hypertension was on antihypertensive treatment which may reduce the effect of hypertension
on aneurysm growth38,39 and explain why we did not find an association between hypertension and aortic aneurysms. We tested both
smoking status and cumulative pack years, but none of them were
associated with aortic aneurysms in our population of PLWH. Male
sex is also a well-described risk factor for aortic aneurysms.7 In this
study, we only observed aneurysms among men, and we were not
able to determine the effect of sex. We might have found more

aneurysms among women if we had used cut-offs that were age, sex,
and body size specific, but whether this would be clinically significant
is unknown.
Development of aortic aneurysms has been closely associated
with chronic inflammation and atherosclerosis,8,40 though it is unclear
whether the association is causative or the result of common risk factors such as smoking and hypertension.4,7,8,40 We found 100% of infrarenal and 26% of suprarenal aortic aneurysms to have calcification,
which supports that atherosclerosis is particularly associated with abdominal aortic aneurysms.41 HIV has previously been associated with
increased risk of atherosclerosis,9,11,42 accordingly this association
might be particularly important for the development of infrarenal
aortic aneurysms. Furthermore, even in patients with relative preserved CD4th counts and undetectable viral load, HIV has been associated with chronic inflammation and immune activation,43,44 and
elevated inflammatory markers in PLWH have been associated with
cardiovascular disease.45,46 Chronic inflammation is thought to lead
to the development of aortic aneurysms through alterations of the
connective tissue in the aortic wall.8 These inflammatory changes are
thought to be associated with aortic wall thickening.41 We found
PLWH to have significantly thicker aortic walls in ascending aortic
aneurysms, but not in suprarenal or infrarenal aortic aneurysms. One
could therefore speculate that particularly ascending aortic aneurysms in PLWH are associated with chronic inflammation. We found
hepatitis B virus co-infection to be associated with increased odds of
aortic aneurysms. In analyses investigating the association between

variables and specific aneurysm sites (Supplementary material online,
Table S5), we found hepatitis B co-infection to be significantly associated with increased odds of suprarenal aortic aneurysms. However,
we only included 18 PLWH with hepatitis B virus co-infection, and
therefore the association between hepatitis B virus and aortic aneurysms may be an incidental finding. Hepatitis B infection has been associated with increased risk of cerebral aneurysm rupture,47 but not
with aneurysm development. Furthermore, in a larger study, co-infection with hepatitis B virus in PLWH was not found to be associated
with risk of CVD.48 Therefore, the association between hepatitis B infection and aortic aneurysm development should be investigated in a
larger population of people with hepatitis B infection. In addition, in
multivariable models we tested low nadir CD4th and found no association with aortic aneurysms. This indicates that prior immunodeficiency is not the driver of aortic aneurysms in PLWH. The
COCOMO cohort consists of mainly well-treated PLWH. Thus,
98.8% were on combination antiretroviral therapy and 96% had undetectable viral replication. As such, we had limited power to determine any impact of ongoing viral replication. Chronic low-grade
inflammation is a feature of HIV infection even in well-treated
cohorts. This is also the case for the COCOMO cohort.44 However,
we did not find significant associations between markers of inflammation including IL-6 and hsCRP and aortic aneurysms in PLWH. In
obese mice, the inflammatory marker IL-18 has been associated with
aneurysm development, which links inflammation, obesity and aneurysm development.49

Previous studies have found syphilis to be associated with aortic
aneurysms, especially in the ascending aorta.15,16 Danish PLWH are
screened for syphilis once a year, and treatment for active infection is
administered promptly and free of charge. Consequently, although a
third of PLWH had signs of previous infection, few may have had untreated syphilis for a longer time period. It could be that only prolonged or tertiary syphilis composes a risk factor for aortic
aneurysms, and we cannot rule out that syphilis constitutes a risk factor for aortic aneurysms in other populations of PLWH with limited
access to screening and treatment. In addition, specific types of antiretroviral therapy have previously been associated with CVD in
PLWH living in Copenhagen,50,51 but we did not find this association
with aortic aneurysms.
There were limitations to this study. First, the study is cross-sectional, which prevents us from drawing any conclusions regarding
causality. Second, study participants were predominantly men and
we observed no aneurysms among women in either PLWH or controls. Therefore, we cannot describe sex-specific differences in the
association between HIV and aortic aneurysms. Third, we only
included 18 PLWH with hepatitis B virus co-infection, and therefore
the association between hepatitis B virus and aortic aneurysms might
be an incidental finding. Fourth, the ethnic distribution differed between PLWH and controls, but since origin was not associated with
aortic aneurysms and the association between HIV and aortic aneurysms was unaltered in a sensitivity analysis of only participants with
European origin, the significance of this is of limited impact. Fifth,
readers of CT scans were not blinded to HIV status.
Strengths of the study include size of the study sample and a uniform approach to data collection in PLWH and controls.
Furthermore, both PLWH and uninfected controls were included
from the same geographical area in the same period. In addition, aortic aneurysms were assessed using gold standard CT scans and both
groups had CT scans performed on the same CT scanner using a uniform protocol for image acquisition and analysis.
In conclusion, well-treated PLWH had higher prevalence of aortic
aneurysms than uninfected controls, and HIV was independently
associated with higher odds of aortic aneurysms. Among PLWH, age,
obesity, and hepatitis B co-infection were associated with higher
odds of aortic aneurysms. Our findings suggest that increased attention to aortic aneurysms in PLWH is warranted.
