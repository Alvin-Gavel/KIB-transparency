This Issue opens with a joint Special Article entitled 'Clinician wellbeing-addressing global needs for improvements in the
health care field: a joint opinion from the American College
of Cardiology, American Heart Association, European
Society of Cardiology, World Heart Federation' by Laxmi
Mehta from the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center in
the USA.1 The authors note that as clinicians, we strive for improved
health for our patients; yet, it is increasingly clear that our own wellbeing is an essential component of the quadruple aim: to improve
population health, enhance patient experience, reduce costs, and improve the work life of healthcare workers. Clinician well-being is
described as experiencing satisfaction and engagement with work,
while also having a feeling of professional fulfilment and a sense of
meaning in work. Conversely, burnout is an occupational phenomenon that is defined as emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and
a sense of low personal accomplishment in a perceived stressful
work environment. Although burnout is a sign of clinical distress and
a barrier to clinician well-being, its absence alone does not confer a
state of well-being. Rather, burnout is one of the more extreme negative components along the spectrum of clinician well-being and can
co-exist with other common mental conditions (e.g. anxiety and
depression).
The Issue continues with a focus on thrombosis and antithrombotic treatment. Infection by SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2) is mainly characterized by fever and respiratory symptoms, with dyspnoea and lung infiltrates in more severe cases. Many patients also present a procoagulant state. In this

context, patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have an
increased risk of developing clinically thrombotic complications such
as pulmonary embolism (PE). Immunological and inflammatoryrelated phenomena may play a role in PE development.2-5 In a
Clinical Research article entitled 'Pulmonary embolism in
patients with COVID-19: incidence, risk factors, clinical
characteristics, and outcome', Oscar Miro from the University
of Barcelona in Spain, and colleagues investigated the incidence, risk
factors, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of PE in patients with
COVID-19 attending emergency departments (EDs), before hospitalization.6 The authors retrospectively reviewed all COVID patients
diagnosed with PE in 62 Spanish EDs (20% of Spanish EDs, case
group) during the first COVID outbreak. They formed control
groups of COVID patients without PE and non-COVID patients with
PE. Adjusted comparisons for baseline characteristics, acute episode
characteristics, and outcomes were made between cases and randomly selected controls (1:1 ratio). The authors identified 368 PEs
among 74 814 patients with COVID-19 (4.92&). The standardized
incidence of PE in the COVID population was 310 per 100 000 person-years, significantly higher than that observed in the non-COVID
population which was 35 per 100 000 person-years, resulting in an
odds ratio (OR) of 8.95. Several characteristics in COVID patients
were independently associated with PE, the strongest being D-dimer
>1000 ng/mL, chest pain, and chronic heart failure (inverse association). COVID patients with PE differed from non-COVID patients
with PE in 16 characteristics, most directly related to COVID infection itself; remarkably, D-dimer >1000 ng/mL, leg swelling/pain, and
PE risk factors were significantly less present. PE in COVID patients
affected smaller pulmonary arteries than in non-COVID patients,
while right ventricular dysfunction (RVD) was similar in both groups.

patients with pulmonary embolism (PE) compared with COVID-19 patients without PE and non-COVID-19 patients with PE (from MiroO, Jimenez
S, Mebazaa A, Freund Y, Burillo-Putze G, Martin A, Martin-Sanchez FJ, Lamberechts J, Alquezar-ArbeeA, Jacob J, Llorens P, Pi~nera P, Gil V, Guardiola

Emergency Situations TeAm (SIESTA) network. Pulmonary embolism in patients with COVID-19: incidence, risk factors, clinical characteristics, and
outcome. See pages 3127-3142).

In-hospital mortality in COVID patients with PE (16.0%) was like that
of COVID patients without PE (16.6%, OR 0.96), but higher than that
of non-COVID patients with PE (6.5%, OR 2.74). Adjustment for differences in baseline and acute episode characteristics and sensitivity
analysis reported very similar associations (Figure 1).
The authors conclude that PE in COVID patients at ED presentation is unusual (0.5%), but the incidence is 9-fold higher than in
the general (non-COVID) population. Moreover, risk factors and leg
symptoms are less frequent, the increase in D-dimer is lower, and
emboli involve smaller pulmonary arteries. While PE probably does
not increase the mortality of COVID patients, the mortality is higher
in COVID than in non-COVID patients with PE. The manuscript is
accompanied by an Editorial by John Eikelboom and Noel Chan
from the Canada and Hamilton General Hospital and McMaster
University in Ontario, Canada.7 The Editorialists conclude that the
data provided by Miro and colleagues lend further support to the importance of COVID-19 as a risk factor for venous thrombo-embolism (VTE). At the same time, in the absence of high-quality evidence
demonstrating a benefit of therapies that prevent VTE, their finding

of a lack of association between PE and death in patients with
COVID-19 should prompt further caution in the routine adoption of
intensified anticoagulant strategies that can increase bleeding. By
reducing blood flow to the lungs, large vessel thrombo-embolism has
the potential to worsen respiratory function in patients with COVID19. However microvascular complications may be the most important thrombo-embolic complications in these patients, and it is unclear
if these can be prevented with therapeutic anticoagulation.
Consistent with this conclusion, randomized trials of intensified
thromboprophylaxis using intermediate or therapeutic doses of anticoagulation have so far failed to demonstrate mortality benefits in a
combined total of 4470 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, despite
apparently reducing major thrombosis including VTE in some trials.
More than 70 randomized trials of antithrombotic therapy are currently ongoing in patients with COVID-19, and their successful completion should help to clarify this issue.
International guidelines suggest home treatment in patients with
low-risk acute pulmonary PE, when home circumstances are adequate.8 However, current evidence is mainly based on cohort

studies using different sets of eligibility criteria. Therefore, controversy persists about the optimal triaging strategy and eligibility criteria
for home treatment. In a Clinical Research contribution entitled
'Triaging acute pulmonary embolism for home treatment
by Hestia or simplified PESI criteria: the HOME-PE
randomized trial', Pierre-Marie Roy from the CHU Angers:
Centre Hospitalier Universitaire d'Angers in France, and colleagues
compared the Hestia rule vs. the simplified Pulmonary Embolism
Severity Index (sPESI criteria) in triaging patients with acute PE for
home treatment.9 Normotensive patients with PE from 26 hospitals
in France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Switzerland were randomized to triaging either with Hestia or sPESI. They were designated for
home treatment if the triaging tool was negative and if the physician
in charge, taking into consideration the patient's opinion, did not consider that hospitalization was required. The main outcomes were the
30-day composite of recurrent VTE, major bleeding, or all-cause
death (non-inferiority analysis with a 2.5% absolute risk difference as
the margin) and the rate of patients discharged home within 24 h
after randomization. In the intention-to-treat analysis, 38% of the
Hestia patients were treated at home vs. 37% of the sPESI patients,
with a 30-day composite outcome rate of 1.3% and 1.1%, respectively. No recurrent or fatal PE occurred in either home treatment arm.
The authors conclude that for triaging PE patients, the strategy
based on the Hestia rule and the strategy based on sPESI have similar

safety and effectiveness. With either tool complemented by the
over-ruling of the physician in charge, more than a third of patients
can be treated at home with a low incidence of complications. The
manuscript is accompanied by an Editorial by Cecilia Becattini from
the University of Perugia in Italy and colleagues.10 The authors highlight that HOME-PE is the largest randomized study assessing home
management in patients with acute PE and its results can contribute
to the progressive refinement in risk stratification and definition of
management pathways for patients with acute PE. Home treatment
seems feasible in 30% of the normotensive patients with acute PE, if
adequate patient care is available as an outpatient service. Hestia and
sPESI are both able to identify a subgroup of patients with acute PE at
low risk for complications, but clinical judgement cannot be completely replaced.
Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an increasingly
diagnosed cause of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), particularly in
women. Its real incidence is probably even higher than reported: indeed, it has been underdiagnosed for years due to the lack of modern
diagnostic tools (e.g. intravascular imaging) and low awareness of the
disease. Observations collected from contemporary SCAD case series have led to the general consensus that conservative therapy
should be considered as first-line approach in the absence of clinical
high-risk features: dissections can resolve spontaneously over time
after conservative management due to recollection of the intimal flap

with an increased risk for major bleeds (adjusted OR 1.49; 95% confidence interval 1.21-1.84) in multivariable-adjusted logistic regression
models and in propensity score-matched cohorts. The results were
consistent in multiple sensitivity analyses. Among ticagrelor-treated
patients, the LDL-C threshold for increased bleeding risk was
observed at <88 mg/dL, whereas, for clopidogrel-treated patients,
the threshold was <54 mg/dL. Across a full spectrum of LDL-C levels,
the treatment effect size associated with ticagrelor vs. clopidogrel on
major bleeds favoured clopidogrel at lower LDL-C levels, with no difference at higher LDL-C levels.
The authors conclude that in a nationwide ACS registry, a non-linear association is identified between admission LDL-C levels and
major in-hospital bleeds following PCI, with the higher risk at lower
levels. The contribution is accompanied by an Editorial by Diana
Adrienne Gorog from the Imperial College London in the UK, and
colleagues.20 The authors note that while the magnitude of benefit of
LDL-C reduction in patients with ACS undergoing PCI should trump
concerns over lipid-lowering strategies (the average in-hospital TIMI
major bleeding rates were below 1.5% and 2% in the lowest LDL-C
categories); in addition, low LDL-C on admission among ACS
patients undergoing PCI may be a marker of increased susceptibility
to bleeding during intensive antithrombotic therapy. Thus, every effort should be made to reduce the risk of bleeding, including with the
use of gastrointestinal prophylaxis, radial rather than femoral artery
access, good blood pressure control, anticoagulant or parenteral
antiplatelet dosing adjusted to weight and renal function, and careful
choice of antithrombotic drugs.
As noted above, patients with acute PE at low risk for short-term
death are candidates for home treatment or short hospital stay. In a
Meta-analysis article entitled 'Right ventricle assessment in
patients with pulmonary embolism at low risk for death
based on clinical models: an individual patient data metaanalysis', Cecilia Becattini from the University of Perugia in Italy, and
colleagues aimed at determining whether the assessment for RVD or
elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP)/N-terminal proBNP (NTproBNP) improves identification of low-risk patients compared with
clinical models alone.21 Individual patient data meta-analysis of studies
assessing the relationship between RVD or elevated troponin and
short-term mortality in patients with acute PE at low risk for death
based on clinical models (PESI, sPESI, or Hestia). The primary study
outcome was short-term death defined as death occurring in hospital
or within 30 days. Individual data of 5010 low-risk patients from 18
studies were pooled. Short-term mortality was 0.7%. RVD at echocardiography, computed tomography, or BNP/NT-proBNP was significantly associated with increased risk for short-term death (1.5 vs.
0.3%; OR 4.81), death within 3 months (1.6 vs. 0.4%; OR 4.03), and
PE-related death (1.1 vs. 0.04%; OR 22.9).
The authors conclude that RVD should be considered to improve
identification of low-risk PE patients. The manuscript is accompanied
by an Editorial by Marc Humbert from the Universite Paris-Saclay
in France.22 Humbert and colleagues conclude that Becattini and colleagues provide more evidence to solve a frequently encountered
clinical dilemma. A patient with acute PE classified as being at low risk
for death, but with abnormal cardiac biomarkers or morphological
right ventricular findings, should be managed as an intermediate-risk
PE patient, as suggested by the most recent update of the ESC guidelines. The prognosis of low-risk patients with no cardiac involvement

or resorption of the intramural haematoma.11-13 The role of antiplatelet therapy in patients with SCAD undergoing initial conservative
management is still a matter of debate, with theoretical arguments in
favour of and against its use. In a Clinical Research article entitled
'Antiplatelet therapy in patients with conservatively managed spontaneous coronary artery dissection', Cerrato et al.
investigated the 1-year outcome of patients with SCAD managed
with initial conservative treatment included in the DIssezioni
Spontanee COronariche (DISCO) multicentre international registry.14 Patients were allocated to two groups according to single antiplatelet treatment (SAPT) or double antiplatelet treatment (DAPT)
prescription. The primary endpoint was the 12 months incidence of
major cardiovascular events (MACE) defined as the composite of allcause death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), and any unplanned
percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Out of 314 patients
included in the DISCO registry, the authors investigated 199 patients
in whom SCAD was managed conservatively. Most patients were female (89%), presented with acute coronary syndrome (ACS; 92%),
and mean age was 52.3 years. Sixty-seven (33.7%) were given SAPT
whereas 132 (66.3%) received DAPT. Aspirin plus either clopidogrel
or ticagrelor were prescribed in 63% and 37% of DAPT patients, respectively. Overall, a 14.6% MACE rate was observed at the 12month follow-up. Patients treated with DAPT had a significantly
higher MACE rate than those with SAPT (18.9% vs. 6.0%, HR 2.62; P
= 0.013), driven by an early excess of non-fatal MI or unplanned PCI.
At multiple regression analysis, type 2a SCAD (OR 3.69; P = 0.007)
and DAPT regimen (OR 4.54; P = 0.016) were independently associated with a higher risk of MACE at 12 months (Figure 2).
Cerrato and colleagues conclude that in this European registry
most patients with SCAD undergoing initial conservative management received DAPT. Yet, at 1-year follow-up, DAPT, as compared
with SAPT, was independently associated with a higher rate of adverse cardiovascular events. This manuscript is accompanied by an
Editorial by Sharonne Hayes from the Mayo Clinic in Rochester,
MN, USA.15 Hayes concludes that although the relative rarity of
SCAD makes development and completion of randomized prospective trials more challenging, the authors' 'counterintuitive' findings
should spur us all on to collaborate and be creative in developing an
evidence base upon which to inform our approach to early and longterm management of SCAD. Critically we must continue to gather
the evidence necessary so that we 'first, do no harm'.
Bleeding risk associated with the potent antithrombotic drugs utilized in ACS is a topic of growing interest.16-18 Emerging evidence
has linked cholesterol metabolism with platelet responsiveness. In a
Clinical Research article entitled 'LDL cholesterol levels and inhospital bleeding in patients on high-intensity antithrombotic therapy: findings from the CCC-ACS Project', Xin
Zhou from the Tianjin Medical University General Hospital in China,
and colleagues sought to examine the dose-response relationship
between admission LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) and major in-hospital
bleeds in ACS patients.19 Among 42 378 ACS patients treated with
PCI enrolled in 192 hospitals in the Improving Care for
Cardiovascular Disease in China-ACS project from 2014 to 2019, a
total of 615 major bleeds, 218 ischaemic events, and 337 deaths were
recorded. After controlling for baseline variables, a non-linear relationship was observed for major bleeds, with a higher risk at lower
LDL-C levels. A threshold value of LDL-C <70 mg/dL was associated

is excellent, which should allow outpatient management to be considered as frequently as possible, subject to a well-organized care
pathway.
The Issue is also complemented by two Discussion Forum contributions. In a commentary entitled 'Single antiplatelet therapy
after TAVI: clarity on existing data', George Dangas from the
Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, USA and colleagues comment on the recent publication 'Management of
antithrombotic therapy in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation: a consensus document of
the ESC Working Group on Thrombosis and the European
Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions
(EAPCI), in collaboration with the ESC Council on Valvular
Heart Disease' by Jurrien ten Berg from the The Cardiovascular
Research Institute Maastricht (CARIM) in Maastricht, the
Netherlands, and colleagues.23,24 ten Berg et al. respond in a separate
comment.25
The editors hope that this issue of the European Heart Journal will
be of interest to its readers.
