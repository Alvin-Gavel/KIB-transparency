Aims

Physical activity may be an important modifiable risk factor for atrial fibrillation (AF), but associations have been
variable and generally based on self-reported activity.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
We analysed 93 669 participants of the UK Biobank prospective cohort study without prevalent AF who wore a
and results
wrist-based accelerometer for 1 week. We categorized whether measured activity met the standard recommenda-

tions of the European Society of Cardiology, American Heart Association, and World Health Organization [moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) >_150 min/week]. We tested associations between guideline-adherent
activity and incident AF (primary) and stroke (secondary) using Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for
age, sex, and each component of the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology AF
(CHARGE-AF) risk score. We also assessed correlation between accelerometer-derived and self-reported activity.
The mean age was 62 +/- 8 years and 57% were women. Over a median of 5.2 years, 2338 incident AF events
occurred. In multivariable adjusted models, guideline-adherent activity was associated with lower risks of AF [hazard ratio (HR) 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75-0.89; incidence 3.5/1000 person-years, 95% CI 3.3-3.8 vs.
6.5/1000 person-years, 95% CI 6.1-6.8] and stroke (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.64-0.90; incidence 1.0/1000 person-years,
95% CI 0.9-1.1 vs. 1.8/1000 person-years, 95% CI 1.6-2.0). Correlation between accelerometer-derived and selfreported MVPA was weak (Spearman r = 0.16, 95% CI 0.16-0.17). Self-reported activity was not associated with incident AF or stroke.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusions
Greater accelerometer-derived physical activity is associated with lower risks of AF and stroke. Future preventive
efforts to reduce AF risk may be most effective when targeting adherence to objective activity thresholds.

Screening

Identification of modifiable risk factors for atrial fibrillation (AF) is a
clinical imperative given the public health burden attributable to the
arrhythmia.1 Physical activity has long been implicated as an AF risk
factor, but relations between activity and AF have been variable and
based largely on self-report. Most population-based studies have
observed lower AF risk with exercise.2,3 Yet benefits may be limited
to those participating in vigorous activity,4 and may be confounded
by body mass index.5 Conversely, vigorous and endurance athletes
may have an increased likelihood of developing AF.6
Previous work has quantified physical activity using questionnaires,7,8 which result in overestimation9 and correlate only
modestly with energy expenditure.10 In contrast, wearable accelerometers provide an objective and reproducible activity measure.11
A precise understanding of the relations between accelerometerderived activity and incident AF may therefore clarify the association between exercise and AF risk. Moreover, since consumer
wearables are increasingly equipped with accelerometers, understanding the relationship between accelerometer-derived physical
activity and AF risk may have implications for utilizing such devices
to assess and modify risk for AF and related morbidity, including
stroke.
In this study, we analysed accelerometer data from nearly 100 000
individuals in the UK Biobank prospective cohort study. We assessed

Wrist-worn accelerometer-derived moderate-to-vigorous physical activity levels meeting standard guideline recommendations is associated with lower
risk of incident atrial fibrillation after adjustment for clinical risk factors. Wearable sensors may enable both objective assessment of physical activity and
modification of AF risk through targeted feedback.

Self-reported physical activity
Self-reported physical activity data were obtained using the short-form
international physical activity questionnaire (IPAQ).22 As performed previously, we converted time spent performing activity (walking, moderate,
vigorous) into metabolic equivalent-min/week.23 We additionally categorized whether self-reported activity met ESC/AHA/WHO standard and
WHO extended. In secondary analyses focusing on vigorous activity, we
utilized data from a separate questionnaire reporting on the frequency of
participation in strenuous sport.

Clinical atrial fibrillation risk
Clinical AF risk factors were defined based on inclusion in the Cohorts
for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology AF (CHARGEAF) score, a validated AF prediction instrument.24 Although not included
in CHARGE-AF, we additionally included sex as an AF risk factor given
previous associations with AF.1
Age, sex, height, weight, and blood pressure were obtained from the
study visit most closely preceding accelerometry. Race was collected
using self-report data and categorized as White vs. other race, in accordance with the CHARGE-AF definition.25 Tobacco and alcohol use were
ascertained using standardized questionnaires. Alcohol use was classified
as standard drinks (14 g alcohol) per week.13 The Townsend Deprivation
Index26 was measured as a surrogate for socioeconomic deprivation.
Antiplatelet and anticoagulant medication use was ascertained through
self-report at an assessment visit as well as prescription information
extracted from linked general practitioner electronic health record data.

.. Remaining clinical factors were defined using self-report and diagnosis
..
.. codes (updated through 31 March 2020). Clinical factor definitions are
.. listed in Supplementary material online, Table S2. CHARGE-AF covariates
..
.. and weights are shown in Supplementary material online, Table S3.
.. Individuals with insufficient anthropometric or blood pressure data to cal.. culate CHARGE-AF were excluded.
..
..
..
.. Outcomes
.. The primary outcome was incident AF. We considered atrial flutter
..
.. equivalent to AF. Given the importance of stroke as a contributor to AF.. related morbidity, we assessed incident stroke as a secondary outcome.
..
.. AF and stroke were defined using previously validated definitions com.. prising self-reported diagnoses, diagnostic/procedural codes linked to
.. hospital encounters, and death records27,28 (Supplementary material on..
.. line, Table S2). Self-reported diagnoses were used only to ascertain the
.. presence of AF and stroke at baseline (i.e. for exclusion from incident
..
.. analyses). Given the potential misclassification of ischaemic vs. haemor.. rhagic stroke mechanisms using diagnosis codes29 and the fact that most
.. strokes are ischaemic, we included all strokes in our primary analysis. We
..
.. performed sensitivity analyses using strokes classified as ischaemic events
.. based on diagnosis codes.
..
..
..
.. Statistical analysis
.. We assessed physical activity distributions in the sample. Given possible
..
.. non-linear effects of physical activity on incident AF,30 we inspected linear
.. and spline fits of the association between AF hazard and (i) mean acceler.. ation, as well as (ii) MVPA min/week, in models adjusted for sex and each
..
.. component of CHARGE-AF. The relation between overall mean acceler.. ation and AF was approximately linear, while the association between
..
.. MVPA and AF suggested possible non-linearity (Supplementary material
.. online, Figure S1). Therefore, we analysed mean acceleration as a continu.. ous variable in our models, and MVPA was categorized into deciles. For
..
.. survival analyses, follow-up began at accelerometer completion and
.. ended at AF (AF models), stroke (stroke models), or the earlier of death
.. or last follow-up (Supplementary material online, Methods). Death was
..
.. treated as a censoring event in the primary models given that cumulative
.. mortality in the overall sample was low [5-year mortality 1.9%, 95% confi..
.. dence interval (CI) 1.8-2.0]; however, in secondary analyses we fit subdis.. tribution hazards models with death treated as a competing risk.31
.. Individuals with the outcome at the time of accelerometer wear were
..
.. excluded from incident analyses.
..
To assess for associations between accelerometer-derived physical ac..
.. tivity and incident AF, we fit Cox proportional hazards models with inci.. dent AF as the outcome and accelerometer-derived physical activity as
..
.. the exposure. The primary exposure definition was MVPA exceeding
.. ESC/AHA/WHO standard recommendations. We additionally classified
.. activity as MVPA exceeding the WHO extended recommendation, mu..
.. tually exclusive guideline-based categories (below ESC/AHA/WHO
.. standard, exceeding ESC/AHA/WHO standard but below WHO
..
.. extended, exceeding WHO extended), days meeting guideline-based
.. average daily MVPA levels, overall mean acceleration, and decile of week.. ly MVPA (Supplementary material online, Figure S2). The proportional
..
.. hazards assumption was assessed using Schoenfeld residuals. Non-pro.. portional hazards (observed only for age and sex) were modelled by
..
.. including interactions with strata of survival time. Within 5025 (5.4%)
.. individuals contributing <1 week of accelerometry, we extrapolated
.. observed MVPA to 7 days since physical activity thresholds are defined
..
.. by week. We assessed models adjusted for age and sex, and models
.. adjusted for sex and each component of the CHARGE-AF score (which
.. includes age). We plotted the crude cumulative risk of AF stratified by ac..
. tivity level, tabulated incidence rates within strata, and calculated

(characteristics of individuals declining invitation were similar to those
accepting, Supplementary material online, Table S1).11 Participants were
sent an Axivity AX3 (Newcastle upon Tyne, UK) wrist-worn triaxial accelerometer. The sensor captured acceleration over 7 days at 100 Hz
with dynamic range of +/-8 g.
As described previously, acceleration signals were calibrated to gravity.11 Sample data were combined into 5 s epochs representing the average vector magnitude. Non-wear time was identified as consecutive
stationary episodes >_60 min in which all three axes had standard deviation <13.0 mg.16 Epochs representing non-wear time were imputed
based on the average of similar time-of-day vector magnitude and intensity distribution data points on different days. We excluded individuals
with insufficient wear time to support imputation (<72 h of wear time or
no wear data in each 1 h period of the 24 h cycle), and whose signals
were insufficient for calibration.11
Accelerometer-derived summary data included overall mean acceleration, a validated surrogate for global physical activity.16,17 As performed
previously, we quantified moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA),
defined as the sum of 5 s epochs where mean acceleration was >_100 mg,
a threshold that corresponds to activity of at least moderate intensity
using wrist-worn accelerometers.18-21 We extracted MVPA in bouts
(5-min periods where >_80% of epochs met the MVPA threshold) in
order to reduce the likelihood of misclassifying artefact as MVPA.19,20 In
secondary analyses, we summed MVPA without restricting to bouts with
minimum duration, and utilized an alternative threshold of >430 mg to
quantify vigorous physical activity.18 For each individual, we determined
whether MVPA levels met the standard recommendations of the
European Society of Cardiology,14 American Heart Association,13 and
World Health Organization12 ('ESC/AHA/WHO standard', >_150 min/
week), and the extended recommendation of the WHO for additional
benefit ('WHO extended', >_300 min/week).12 For participants contributing a full week of accelerometry, we tabulated the number of days individuals exceeded average daily MVPA corresponding to ESC/AHA/
WHO standard (>_25 min/day) and WHO extended (>_45 min/day).

Accelerometer-derived physical activity and risk of atrial fibrillation

Results
Sample characteristics
Of 103 695 participants contributing accelerometer data, we
excluded 7000 for insufficient wear time or failure of calibration, 281
with inadequate data for clinical AF risk estimation, and 2745 with
prevalent AF, withdrawn consent, or absence of follow-up data,
resulting in 93 669 individuals in the primary analysis (Supplementary
material online, Figure S3). The mean age was 62 +/- 8 years and 57%
were female. Other baseline characteristics are listed in Table 1.
Characteristics of excluded individuals are shown in Supplementary
material online, Table S4.
The distribution of accelerometer-derived physical activity is
shown in Supplementary material online, Figure S4. Using accelerometer-derived MVPA, 43 813 (46.8%) participants met ESC/AHA/
WHO standard recommendations, and 17 547 (18.7%) met WHO
extended recommendations. The number of days individuals met
guideline-recommended MVPA levels is shown in Supplementary
material online, Figure S5. Using self-reported MVPA among 93 579
individuals providing IPAQ data, 48 445 (51.8%) met ESC/AHA/
WHO standard, and 29 897 (31.9%) met WHO extended recommendations (Supplementary material online, Table S5 and
Supplementary material online, Figure S6).

Atrial fibrillation associations
In total, 2338 individuals developed incident AF over a median of 5.2
(quartile-1: 4.6, quartile-3: 5.8) years of follow-up spanning August
2013-March 2020 [overall cumulative risk of AF 3.6% (95% CI 3.3-
4.0); incidence rate 5.0/1000 person-years (95% CI 4.8-5.2)]. In models adjusted for sex and each component of CHARGE-AF, activity
exceeding the ESC/AHA/WHO standard recommendation [hazard
ratio (HR) 0.82 (95% CI 0.75-0.89)] and increasing MVPA decile [HR

..
.. 0.96 per one decile increase (95% CI 0.94-0.97)] were associated
.. with lower risk of AF (P < 0.01 for both, Table 2). The crude cumula..
.. tive risk of AF stratified by adherence to ESC/AHA/WHO standard
.. and WHO extended recommendations is shown in Figure 1. When
..
.. assessing MVPA deciles as independent categories using adjusted
.. models, AF risk decreased until decile seven (175-220 min/week),
..
.. after which it remained approximately similar (Figure 2,
.. Supplementary material online, Figure S1, and Supplementary material
..
.. online, Table S6). Mean acceleration was not associated with AF in
.. adjusted models [HR 0.97 per one standard deviation increase (95%
..
.. CI 0.92-1.02), P = 0.25]. AF risk was similar among individuals meet.. ing the WHO extended recommendation as compared to individuals
..
.. meeting the ESC/AHA/WHO standard recommendation only [HR
.. 1.14 (95% CI 0.98-1.31), P = 0.09, Supplementary material online,
..
.. Tables S7 and S8].
..
The IRR for AF was approximately half among individuals meeting
..
.. the ESC/AHA/WHO standard recommendation [0.55 (95% CI 0.50-
.. 0.59)] and WHO extended recommendation [0.63 (95% CI 0.55-
..
.. 0.71)] vs. those not meeting the respective recommendations
.. (Supplementary material online, Table S9). The crude cumulative risk
..
.. of AF stratified by mutually exclusive guideline-based categories of
..
.. physical activity and deciles of MVPA are shown in Supplementary
.. material online, Figures S7 and S8, respectively. Sex-stratified adjusted
..
.. curves demonstrated that AF risk was higher for men vs. women at a
.. given activity level and are shown in Supplementary material online,
..
.. Figures S9-S11.
..
The number of days individuals met guideline-recommended
..
.. MVPA levels was also associated with lower risk of incident AF [HR
.. 0.95 per day with >_25 min (95% CI 0.93-0.97), P < 0.01; HR 0.95 per
..
.. day with >_45 min (95% CI 0.93-0.98), P < 0.01; Figure 3 and
.. Supplementary material online, Table S10].
..
Correlation between accelerometer-derived and self-reported
..
.. MVPA was weak [r = 0.16 (95% CI 0.16-0.17), P < 0.01, Figure 4] and
..
.. agreement for meeting the ESC/AHA/WHO standard [raw agree.. ment: 56.0%; kappa 0.12 (95% CI 0.12-0.13)] and WHO extended
..
.. [64.8%; 0.09 (95% CI 0.08-0.10)] recommendations was poor
.. (Supplementary material online, Tables S11 and S12). Although dis..
.. agreement occurred in both directions, a greater proportion of indi.. viduals met standard guidelines by self-report data but did not meet
..
.. them objectively (47%), as compared to individuals who met guide.. lines objectively based on accelerometer data but did not meet them
..
.. according to self-report (42%, P < 0.01). Self-reported activity meet.. ing guideline recommendations was not associated with decreased
..
.. risk of AF or stroke (Supplementary material online, Tables S13 and
..
.. S14).
..
..
.. Stroke associations
.. A total of 645 participants developed incident stroke, of which 46
..
.. (7.1%) occurred following incident AF. The overall cumulative risk of
.. stroke was 0.92% (95% CI 0.83-1.00) and the stroke incidence rate
..
.. 1.4/1000 person-years (95% CI 1.3-1.5). In models adjusted for sex
.. and each component of CHARGE-AF, activity meeting the ESC/
..
.. AHA/WHO standard recommendation [HR 0.76 (95% CI 0.64-
.. 0.90), P < 0.01], activity meeting the ESC/AHA/WHO extended rec..
.. ommendation [HR 0.78 (95% CI 0.61-0.99), P = 0.04], mean acceler.. ation [HR 0.82 per 1-SD (95% CI 0.75-0.91), P < 0.01], and increasing
..
. MVPA decile [HR 0.94 per one decile increase (95% CI 0.91-0.97),

incidence rate ratios (IRRs). To generate adjusted risk curves, we plotted
cumulative risk estimates from AF risk-adjusted Cox models assuming
the mean CHARGE-AF score and stratifying by sex (since male sex was
consistently associated with greater risk of AF in adjusted models). We
then fit similar models assessing incident stroke.
We examined relations between self-reported physical activity and AF
and stroke. Given non-normality, we assessed the Spearman correlation
between self-reported vs. accelerometer-derived MVPA. We quantified
level of agreement between achievement of guideline-recommended levels using kappa statistics and assessed significance of disagreement using
McNemar's test. We fit Cox models analogous to those described above
using self-reported activity as the exposure. Given delay between IPAQ
administration and accelerometry [median time from IPAQ to accelerometry (quartile-1, quartile-3): 5.5 years (4.6, 6.3)], we performed sensitivity analyses restricted to individuals contributing to follow-up IPAQ
data [2.2 years (1.8, 2.5)].
We performed multiple secondary analyses, including fitting adjusted
models using alternative accelerometer variables as the exposures of
interest, such as the coefficient of variation in mean acceleration (e.g. a
measure of overall variability in activity over the course of the week), and
weekly minutes of vigorous physical activity. All secondary and sensitivity
analyses are described in detail in the Supplementary material online,
Methods. Analyses were performed using R v3.632 (packages: 'survival',
'data.table', and 'prodlim'). We considered two-sided P-values <0.05 statistically significant.

Exploratory and sensitivity analyses
In exploratory sex and AF risk-adjusted analyses, greater vigorous
physical activity was generally associated with a reduced risk of AF
(HR 0.98 per one decile increase, 95% CI 0.96-0.99, P < 0.01), until
the highest decile. Individuals in the highest decile of vigorous physical
activity (>67 min/week) had a similar risk of AF as those in the lowest
decile (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.73-1.09, P = 0.25), and a higher risk than
individuals in the 8th decile (28-40 min/week; HR 1.34, 95% CI 1.07-
1.68, P = 0.01), who had the lowest adjusted AF risk overall
(Supplementary material online, Figure S15). In contrast, greater vigorous physical activity was associated with a more uniform reduction
in stroke risk (HR 0.94 per one decile increase, 95% CI 0.91-0.97,
P < 0.01). Individuals in higher deciles of vigorous activity were more
likely to report engagement in strenuous sports (chi-square trend
P < 0.01), including 0.3% in the lowest decile vs. 2.1% in the highest
decile (Supplementary material online, Figure S16).

Increasing intra-individual coefficient of variation in mean acceleration [HR 0.98 per 10% increase (95% CI 0.97-0.99), P < 0.01] was
also associated with decreased AF risk. Associations between guideline-adherent activity and reduced AF and stroke risk persisted in analyses restricted to the 88 645 individuals contributing a full week of
accelerometry, non-imputed data, MVPA defined without bout criteria, in models adjusted for body mass index (instead of height and
weight), and in models additionally adjusted for alcohol use, sleep apnoea, Townsend Deprivation Index, antiplatelet use, and anticoagulant
use (Supplementary material online, Tables S15-S18). Stroke association results were similar in models considering only events coded as
ischaemic strokes (Supplementary material online, Table S19).
Associations between meeting ESC/AHA/WHO standard recommendations and incident AF (subdistribution HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.75-
0.90, P < 0.01) and stroke (subdistribution HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.65-0.92,
P < 0.01) were also similar when death was modelled as a competing
risk. Detailed results of the primary AF and stroke models including
covariate strengths of association are shown in Supplementary material online, Tables S20 and S21. Exploration of models utilizing overall
mean acceleration as the activity variable revealed that adjustment
only for age, sex, and weight was sufficient to attenuate associations
with incident AF [HR 0.96 (95% CI 0.91-1.01), P = 0.09].

100 000 primarily middle-aged and older individuals over 7 days, we
found that increased activity was associated with lower risk of incident AF. Individuals meeting guideline recommendations from the
ESC,14 AHA,13 and WHO12 had approximately half the AF incidence
compared to individuals not meeting activity recommendations.
Accelerometer-derived physical activity was a far more robust indicator of AF risk than self-reported activity measured several years
prior, which was not associated with disease risk. We observed similar associations between accelerometer-derived physical activity and
incident stroke.
Our study extends prior work by quantifying associations between
objective physical activity measured using wrist-worn accelerometers
and incident AF. Previous studies have offered conflicting results
regarding the association between activity and AF, with certain studies suggesting benefit,2,3 others showing no relationship after

adjusting for confounders,5 and yet others demonstrating higher risk
at either extreme.6 In contrast to self-reported activity, which is subject to recall bias9 and correlates modestly with measured energy expenditure,10 we leveraged prospectively collected accelerometerderived physical activity in nearly 100 000 individuals to assess associations with incident AF and stroke. Consistent with limitations of selfreported activity, questionnaire-based activity levels correlated very
weakly with objective physical activity measured several years later,
and observed associations with AF and stroke were not apparent
using self-reported activity measures alone.
Our results identify objectively quantified physical activity as an important modifiable AF risk factor. Using wrist-worn accelerometers
in 5000 individuals, O'Neal et al.34 recently reported lower AF risk
with increasing MVPA, but only a trend towards reduced risk with
guideline-based levels of activity. Our findings demonstrate that

Accelerometer-derived physical activity and risk of atrial fibrillation

activity in accordance with guidelines is indeed associated with substantially lower risks of incident AF and stroke, even after adjustment
for AF risk factors. Previous studies by Elliott et al.7 and Said et al.35 in
larger subsets of the UK Biobank have suggested greater selfreported activity may be beneficial for AF risk. However, similar to
Tikkanen et al.,2 we did not observe an association between selfreported activity and incident AF after considering baseline clinical
factors. Although contrasting findings may be related to differences in
sample size and composition, as well as our adjustment for each component of the CHARGE-AF instrument, we note that the effect sizes

observed in the studies reporting significant associations were modest. Therefore, especially since current clinical guidelines do not comment on how adherence to activity recommendations should be
ascertained,13,14 our study provides important evidence that objectively measured activity is a more robust indicator of AF risk than selfreported activity. In addition to established benefits on weight and
blood pressure, exercise may directly reduce AF risk through favourable effects on autonomic tone and atrial function.30,36 Of note, the
association between overall mean acceleration and AF was attenuated after adjustment for AF risk (in particular, weight5), whereas
MVPA-both overall and according to guideline thresholds-
remained strongly associated with decreased AF risk in adjusted
models, suggesting that activity of at least moderate intensity may be
particularly important for AF risk.34 On balance, our findings suggest
that efforts to prevent AF by promoting physical activity are warranted and should utilize objectively measured activity data when
possible.
Specifically, population-level efforts to reduce AF risk may be most
effective if they aim to maximize the proportion of individuals objectively achieving guideline-adherent activity levels, rather than encouraging higher volume or intensity exercise among individuals who are
already active. After adjusting for clinical AF risk factors, AF hazard
appeared to decrease until the seventh decile of MVPA (i.e. 175-
220 min of MVPA/week), after which point it remained relatively constant. Likewise, AF and stroke risk among individuals exceeding the
more stringent WHO activity threshold (>_300 min MVPA/week)
were similar compared to individuals exceeding the standard thresholds (>_150 min MVPA/week) only. Such findings support recent
results suggesting that inactivity may be a causal risk factor for coronary heart disease.37 Consistent with prior observations,6,38-40
adjusted AF risk appeared lowest at intermediate levels of vigorous
activity, with individuals in the lowest (0-3 min/week) and highest
(>67 min/week) deciles of vigorous activity both having a roughly
30% increased risk of AF as compared to individuals in the 8th decile
(i.e. 28-40 min/week). On balance, our findings support the recommendations of the 2020 ESC guidelines on AF management, which
promote moderate levels of physical activity among individuals at risk
for AF.41 Importantly, vigorous activity quantification using wristworn accelerometers is less well-established than classification of
MVPA,18-21 and our window of objective observation was limited to
1 week. As a result, future work is warranted to clarify potential positive associations between especially vigorous or abundant objective
physical activity and AF, especially among younger individuals.39
Our results highlight a potential opportunity to link AF diagnostic
and preventive efforts (Graphical Abstract).42 The mAFA-II trial recently showed that a smartphone app enabling both an AF screening
and risk mitigation pathway resulted in reduced AF-related hospitalizations.43 Since wrist-worn wearables capable of AF screening are
becoming increasingly prevalent and are now commonly equipped
with accelerometers, our results suggest that wearable sensors may
have utility in both prevention and detection of AF.44 We acknowledge that different devices may be available for objectively measuring
physical activity, each with different potential advantages and disadvantages. The wrist-worn accelerometer may be optimally suited for
measuring activity in relation to AF risk given the increasing capability
of consumer technology to detect possible AF via photoplethysmography and electrocardiography. Nevertheless, uncertainties and

as well as bias introduced by enrolment. Similarly, individuals who
accepted the invitation to the accelerometry sub-study had slightly
lower rates of cardiac comorbidity than UK Biobank participants
who declined. However, the AF and stroke rates we observed in our
sample are generally consistent with population-based estimates
within similar age groups.45-47 Second, use of diagnostic and procedural codes27 to define AF introduces potential misclassification.

.. objective short-term activity measurement with longitudinal out..
.. comes.33,34 Fourth, we collapsed moderate and vigorous physical ac.. tivity as MVPA in our primary analyses given multiple studies
..
.. supporting the use of wrist-worn activity sensors to classify activity of
.. at least moderate intensity.18-21 However, we did perform explora..
.. tory analyses in which we specifically quantified vigorous physical ac.. tivity using a validated threshold.18 Fifth, accuracy of MVPA detection

.. using wrist-worn accelerometers varies somewhat across studies and
.. may be lower with certain activities (e.g. stationary cycling).48,49
..
.. Reassuringly, MVPA levels in our study are broadly consistent with
.. estimates from national UK-based surveys,50 self-reported data from
..
.. the same individuals, and past wrist-worn accelerometer-based stud.. ies.34 Furthermore, variability in continuous acceleration measure..
.. ment (in contrast to proprietary step counts) across device brands is
.. modest.21 Sixth, the IPAQ was administered roughly five years prior
..
.. to accelerometry in most participants. As a result, more recent ques..
.. tionnaire data may have provided a more accurate self-reported ac.. tivity estimate, although we note that the IPAQ demonstrates good
..
.. short-term repeatability.22 Furthermore, we did not observe associa.. tions between self-reported activity and reduced risk of AF or stroke
..
.. among the subset of individuals who provided follow-up IPAQ data,
.. which more closely preceded accelerometer wear (i.e. within
..
.. 3 years). Seventh, given observational design we cannot infer causality
.. or eliminate residual confounding.
..
In summary, among nearly 100 000 middle-aged and older individ..
.. uals within a prospective UK-based cohort, guideline-adherent ob..
.. jective activity levels quantified using wrist-based sensors worn over
.. 7 days was associated with lower risks of incident AF and stroke after
..
.. adjustment for AF risk factors. In contrast to accelerometer-derived
.. activity, self-reported physical activity measured several years prior
..
.. was not associated with reduced risks of AF or stroke. Future clinical
.. guidelines should acknowledge the potential value of objectively
..
.. assessing adherence to recommended activity levels. Wearable devi.. ces capable of objective activity monitoring, motivational messaging,

.. and AF detection may offer an integrated mechanism for AF preven.. tion and diagnosis.
