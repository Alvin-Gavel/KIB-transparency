This Issue opens with the first of a new article category of the
European Heart Journal (EHJ): the Debate. Each Debate is made up of
three sections: an Introduction, which presents the topic to debate
and why it has been selected, together with a Pro and a Contra. This
article category reproduces the format of the Debate sessions seen
at the Annual Meeting of the European Society of Cardiology. The
current contribution is entitled 'Debate: Prasugrel rather than
ticagrelor is the preferred treatment for NSTE-ACS
patients who proceed to PCI, and pre-treatment should
not be performed in patients planned for an early invasive
strategy'.1 In this first Debate, a panel of distinguished colleagues led
by Evangelos Giannitsis, the authors of the Contra section, raise their
concern over some recommendations included in the Guidelines for
the management of acute coronary syndromes in patients presenting
without persistent ST-segment elevation in regard to antithrombotic
treatment in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).2 The authors of the Guidelines led by Holger Thiele explain the reasons which led to their recommendations in the Pro
section of the Debate. The EHJ offers this unique platform, the
Debate, with the goal of helping readers to dissipate the grey in the
difficult decisions they must take during their daily practice.
In a Viewpoint article entitled 'Interpreting myocardial infarction analyses in ISCHEMIA: separating facts from fallacy',
Raffaele De Caterina from the University of Pisa and David Brown
from Washington University in St Louis3 note that after a decade of
planning and execution, the International Study of Comparative
Health Effectiveness With Medical and Invasive Approaches
(ISCHEMIA) trial was published in April 2020 and a flow of ancillary
reports rapidly followed.4 This landmark study found that in patients
with chronic coronary syndromes (CCS), both the composite primary endpoint [cardiovascular (CV) death, myocardial infarction
(MI), hospitalization for unstable angina or heart failure, or resuscitated cardiac arrest] and the secondary endpoint (CV death and MI)
were not different between the two strategies, refuting the

hypothesis and long-held belief of a prognostic benefit from an invasive strategy with revascularization by PCI or coronary artery bypass
graft (CABG) surgery in CCS patients with moderate to severe
inducible myocardial ischaemia. Not surprisingly, peri-procedural MI
was more frequent in the invasive arm, whereas late, spontaneous MI
was more frequent in the conservative arm. On this basis, some have
concluded that revascularization should be offered to CCS patients
to prevent 'prognostically important' infarctions, i.e. spontaneous
(Type 1) MI. This commentary seeks to provide a rebuttal to this
speculative conclusion also based on the results of some recent
studies.5,6
In another Viewpoint entitled 'The importance of achieving
sex- and gender-based equity in clinical trials: a call to action', Jeske van Diemen from the Amsterdam Universitair Medische
Centra in the Netherlands, and colleagues note that women are
under-represented in clinical trials and the current guidelines are
based on recommendations from clinical trials that predominantly
included men to generate the evidence behind our therapies and
interventions.7 Additionally, there is a paucity of knowledge regarding
the reasons for the under-representation of women. After an extensive literature search of CV clinical trials, the authors found only six
articles that reported on challenges and barriers and the motivators
behind the decisions to participate in clinical trials. In terms of barriers, both male and female participants reported time constraints,
apprehension towards being in a clinical trial with an experimental
design or therapy, or the potential of an unfavourable outcome and
risk of harm. Women declined to participate more often than men
because they perceived a higher risk of harm from trial participation
as compared with men. Overall, women need extra reassurance of
their significant value in order to participate in a clinical research setting. The challenges and facilitators are likely to differ based on country, regions, and across cultures and healthcare systems, and there is
no 'one size fits all' solution. By implementing the right frameworks
for the design of the trial, including more women leadership in clinical
trial committees and inviting women patients to participate in the discussion of the design, researchers will be more likely to attain sex
and gender parity.8

Issue @ a Glance

The foundations for prevention of CV diseases are lifestyle modification, including smoking cessation, moderate alcohol intake, healthy
diet, and regular exercise. However, these strategies are not fully
implemented and, even when implemented, do not eliminate the risk
of CV diseases. Therefore, added interventions with drugs are often
required.9,10 The Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE)-3
study was designed to determine if a reduction in LDL cholesterol
(LDL-C) or blood pressure (BP), either alone or in combination,
would reduce CV events in patients at intermediate risk with no prior
overt clinical CV events. After 5.6 years of treatment, rosuvastatin
10 mg daily compared with placebo reduced MACE (including MI,
stroke, or death from CV causes) by 24%. Despite reducing systolic
BP by 6 mmHg, the combination of candesartan (16 mg daily) and
hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg daily) compared with placebo did not
reduce MACE significantly in the overall trial population. In a Clinical
Research article entitled 'Lowering cholesterol, blood pressure,
or both to prevent cardiovascular events: results of 8.7
years of follow-up of Heart Outcomes Evaluation
Prevention (HOPE)-3 study participants', Jackie Bosch from
McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada, and colleagues examined
whether the benefits observed during the active treatment phase in
the HOPE-3 trial were sustained, enhanced, or attenuated 3.1 years
after cessation of all the trial medications.11 The first co-primary outcome for the entire duration of follow-up was the composite of MI,
stroke, or CV death (MACE-1), and the second was MACE-1 plus

resuscitated cardiac arrest, heart failure, or coronary revascularization (MACE-2); 78% of 11 994 surviving HOPE-3 subjects consented
to participate in this extended follow-up. During 3.1 years of posttrial observation, participants originally randomized to rosuvastatin
compared with placebo had a significant 20% additional reduction in
MACE-1 and a 17% additional reduction in MACE-2 of borderline
statistical significance. In sharp contrast, there was no significant benefit of BP lowering in the overall study, during either the active or the
post-trial observation period, although a 24% reduction in MACE-1
was observed over 8.7 years in those with the highest blood pressure
values at baseline (Figure 1).
Bosch et al. conclude that the cardiovascular benefits of rosuvastatin, and BP lowering in those with elevated systolic BP, compared
with placebo, continue to accrue for at least 3 years after cessation of
randomized treatment in individuals without CV disease, indicating a
legacy effect. Indeed, both statins and BP lowering may cause structural changes in the vasculature, such as alterations of plaque morphology and composition that may lead to continued or enhanced
benefits during further observation. The contribution is accompanied
by an Editorial by Eric Boersma and Isabella Kardys from Erasmus
MC in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.12 The authors conclude that the
initial beneficial effect of rosuvastatin treatment that was observed in
the HOPE-3 trial persisted for at least 3 years after termination of the
study. For now, the effective use of such agents by individuals without
clinically established disease, and at low to moderate CV risk, seems

to remain a matter of shared decision-making by these individuals
and their physicians, which includes a well-informed weighing up of
the pros and cons.
Iron deficiency is a potential therapeutic target in patients with
heart failure.13 In a clinical research article entitled 'The effect of
intravenous ferric carboxymaltose on health-related quality of life in iron-deficient patients with acute heart failure:
the results of the AFFIRM-AHF study', Ewa Jankowska from
Wroclaw Medical University in Poland, and colleagues evaluated the
impact of i.v. ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) vs. placebo on healthrelated quality of life (HRQoL) for the AFFIRM-AHF population.14
The baseline 12-item Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire
(KCCQ-12), which was completed for 1058 patients, was administered prior to randomization and at weeks 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 36, and
52. The baseline KCCQ-12 overall summary score (OSS) mean +/-
SE error was 38.7 +/- 0.9 (FCM group) and 37.1 +/- 0.8 (placebo
group); corresponding values for the clinical summary score (CSS)
were 40.9 +/- 0.9 and 40.1 +/- 0.9. At week 2, changes in OSS and
CSS were similar for FCM and placebo. From week 4 to week 24,
patients assigned to FCM had significantly greater improvements
in OSS and CSS scores vs. placebo. The adjusted mean difference
at week 4 was: 2.9 (P = 0.018) for OSS and 2.8 (P = 0.029) for CSS;
and at week 24: 3.0 (P = 0.028) for OSS and 2.9 (P = 0.035) for
CSS. At week 52, the treatment effect had attenuated but
remained in favour of FCM.
The authors conclude that in iron-deficient patients with heart failure and left ventricular ejection faction <_50% stabilized after an episode of acute heart failure, treatment with i.v. FCM, compared with
placebo, results in clinically meaningful beneficial effects on HRQoL
as early as 4 weeks after treatment initiation, lasting up to week 24.
The manuscript is accompanied by an Editorial by Tibor Kempf
from the Hannover Medical School in Germany.15 Kempf concludes
that AFFIRM-AHF identifies iron deficiency as a treatment target in
patients stabilized after an episode of acute heart failure. The inhospital setting provides an excellent opportunity to administer FCM
prior to discharge, thereby enhancing clinical uptake of this safe, simple, and effective treatment. Heart failure networks need to ensure
that a second dose is infused after 6 weeks, if necessary, and that iron
status is re-assessed every 3-4 months. Future studies should explore the regulation and functional implications of cardiac and skeletal
muscle iron deficiency in heart failure patients to design individualized
iron supplementation strategies.
The issue is also complemented by two Discussion Forum contributions. In a commentary entitled 'Underlying mechanisms
involved in the icosapent ethyl reduction of cardiovascular
events still cannot be attributed to an anti-atherosclerotic
effect', Gaston Rodriguez-Granillo from the Clinica La Sagrada
Familia in Buenos Aires, Argentina and colleagues comment on the
recent publication 'Effect of icosapent ethyl on progression of
coronary atherosclerosis in patients with elevated triglycerides on statin therapy: final results of the EVAPORATE trial'
by Matthew J Budoff from the Lundquist Institute at Harbor-UCLA
Medical Center in Torrance, CA, USA.16,17 Budoff et al. respond in a
separate comment.18
The editors hope that readers of this issue of the European Heart
Journal will find it of interest.
