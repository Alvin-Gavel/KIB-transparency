Aims

The aim of this study was to develop, validate, and illustrate an updated prediction model (SCORE2) to estimate
10-year fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in individuals without previous CVD or diabetes aged
40-69 years in Europe.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
We derived risk prediction models using individual-participant data from 45 cohorts in 13 countries (677
684 individuals, 30 121 CVD events). We used sex-specific and competing risk-adjusted models, including
and results
age, smoking status, systolic blood pressure, and total- and HDL-cholesterol. We defined four risk regions in
Europe according to country-specific CVD mortality, recalibrating models to each region using expected
incidences and risk factor distributions. Region-specific incidence was estimated using CVD mortality and incidence data on 10 776 466 individuals. For external validation, we analysed data from 25 additional cohorts
in 15 European countries (1 133 181 individuals, 43 492 CVD events). After applying the derived risk prediction models to external validation cohorts, C-indices ranged from 0.67 (0.65-0.68) to 0.81 (0.76-0.86).
Predicted CVD risk varied several-fold across European regions. For example, the estimated 10-year CVD
risk for a 50-year-old smoker, with a systolic blood pressure of 140 mmHg, total cholesterol of 5.5 mmol/L,
and HDL-cholesterol of 1.3 mmol/L, ranged from 5.9% for men in low-risk countries to 14.0% for men in
very high-risk countries, and from 4.2% for women in low-risk countries to 13.7% for women in very highrisk countries.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
SCORE2-a new algorithm derived, calibrated, and validated to predict 10-year risk of first-onset CVD in

European populations-enhances the identification of individuals at higher risk of developing CVD across
Europe.

Cardiovascular disease

Introduction
Cardiovascular diseases (CVD), which include coronary heart disease
and stroke, are the most common fatal non-communicable diseases
globally, responsible for an estimated 18.6 million deaths in 2019.1,2
Cardiovascular diseases remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Europe. The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) provides
guidelines and advocates the use of risk prediction models to enhance healthcare and population-wide prevention.3,4 Risk models,
which integrate information on several conventional CVD risk factors, typically estimate individual risk over a 10-year period. The goal
is to identify people at higher risk of CVD who should benefit most
from preventive action.
The ESC has convened an effort to revise its recommended risk prediction algorithm, known as the Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation
(SCORE) model,5 to address inter-related needs. SCORE includes only

fatal CVD outcomes, meaning it underestimates total CVD burden,
which in recent decades has shifted towards non-fatal outcomes, especially for younger people.1 SCORE does not allow for substantial variations of risk across countries from the same risk region, meaning it may
mis-estimate risk in these circumstances. SCORE was developed from
cohorts recruited before 1986 and has not been systematically 'recalibrated' (i.e. statistically adapted) to contemporary CVD rates, meaning
it is not ideal for use in contemporary European populations. Finally,
risk prediction models recommended for other global regions,6,7 may
not be readily applicable to European populations because they typically include risk factors not available in routine European data sources
needed for risk model recalibration.6,8-10
To address these limitations, we provide the development, validation, and illustration of SCORE2 to estimate 10-year fatal and nonfatal CVD risk in individuals in Europe without previous CVD or diabetes aged 40-69 years.

The SCORE2 project involved multiple data sources (Figure 1). First, to
enable reliable estimation of age- and sex-specific relative risks, we
derived prediction models for fatal and non-fatal CVD outcomes using
individual-participant data from 45 prospective cohorts involving 677
684 participants in 13 countries. Second, to adapt risk prediction models to the circumstances of each European region, we recalibrated the
derived risk models using estimated contemporary age- and
sex-specific incidences and risk factor distributions. Third, to enhance
validity and generalizability, we completed external validation using individual-participant data from a further 25 prospective cohorts (i.e.
studies not in the model derivation) involving 1 133 181 individuals in
15 European countries. Fourth, to illustrate the variation of CVD risk
across European regions, we applied the model to contemporary
populations.

.. Data sources and procedures
..
.. For model derivation, we used individual-participant data from 44
.. cohorts included in the Emerging Risk Factor Collaboration (ERFC) and
..
.. the UK Biobank (UKB).11,12 The ERFC has collated and harmonized indi.. vidual-participant data from many long-term prospective cohort studies
..
.. of CVD risk factors and outcomes. Prospective studies in the ERFC were
.. included in this analysis if they met all the following criteria: had recorded
.. baseline information on risk factors necessary to derive risk prediction
..
.. models (age, sex, smoking status, history of diabetes mellitus, systolic
.. blood pressure, and total- and HDL-cholesterol); were approximately
..
.. population-based [i.e. did not select participants on the basis of having
.. previous disease (e.g. case-control studies) and were not active treatment
.. arms of intervention studies]; had a median year of baseline survey after
..
.. 1990; and had recorded cause-specific deaths and/or non-fatal CVD
.. events (i.e. non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke) for at least 1-year of
..
.. follow-up. The UKB is a single large prospective cohort study with indi.. vidual-participant data on approximately 500 000 participants aged
.

Statistical analysis
Details of statistical analysis are provided in Supplementary material online, Methods. For model derivation, sex-specific associations [i.e. subdistribution hazard ratios (SHRs)] were estimated using Fine and Gray
competing risk-adjusted models stratified by cohort. The sex-specific
models included the following predictors: age, current smoking, history
of diabetes mellitus, systolic blood pressure, and total- and HDL-cholesterol. The risk factors were selected due to their predictive ability as
well as their availability in: derivation cohorts, target populations for
screening, and population statistics needed for model recalibration.
Since previous research showed that associations of these risk factors
with CVD decline with increasing age, age-interactions were added for
all predictors.28 To maximize statistical power when estimating ageinteractions, risk models were derived in participants aged 40-79 years
at baseline without previous CVD. However, SCORE2 risk models are
intended for use in people aged 40-69 years. In a parallel initiative, a risk

score for individuals aged over 70, SCORE2-OP, has been developed
using similar methods,29 While the SCORE2 risk models are not
intended for use in individuals with diabetes, participants with a history
of diabetes were included at the model derivation stage (with appropriate adjustment for diabetes status), since it wasn't possible to exclude
people with diabetes from population-level mortality statistics and risk
factor data used in recalibration. There were no (or only very minimal)
violations of the proportional hazards assumptions. Meta-regression was
used to assess temporal and geographical heterogeneity.
Risk models were recalibrated to risk regions using age- and sex-specific mean risk factor levels and CVD incidence rates.30 All European countries were grouped into four risk regions according to their most recently
reported WHO age- and sex-standardized overall CVD mortality rates
per 100 000 population (ICD 10 chapters IX, I00-I99).13 The four groupings were low risk (<100 CVD deaths per 100 000), moderate risk (100
to <150 CVD deaths per 100 000), high risk (150 to <300 CVD deaths
per 100 000), and very high risk (>_300 CVD deaths per 100 000)
(Figure 2 and Supplementary material online, Table S6). Incidence rates
were estimated by rescaling region-specific CVD mortality rates, by
derived age-, sex-, and region-specific multipliers, estimated in contemporary representative cohorts from each region (Supplementary material
online, Table S2). We assessed discrimination using external validation
cohorts by calculating Harrell's C-index, adjusted for competing risks,31
and in the case of EPIC-CVD weighting according to the case-cohort
structure of the data.32 Comparison of SCORE2 and SCORE in relation
to discrimination and calibration was performed in CPRD, as the only nationally representative data source with both risk factor and outcome information available at the individual-participant level. To compare the
proportion of the population at different levels of CVD event risk according to the SCORE2 models, predicted risk distributions were simulated
using age- and sex-specific risk factor value means and prevalences from
NCD-RisC and correlation structures observed in ERFC cohorts.
Approaches used to handle missing data are described in the
Supplementary material online, Methods. We adopted analytical
approaches and reporting standards recommended by the PROBAST
guidelines33 and TRIPOD.34 Analyses were performed with R-statistic
programming (version 3.5.2, R Foundation for Statistical Computing,
Vienna, Austria) and Stata (version 15.1, StataCorp, College Station, TX,
USA). The study was designed and completed by the SCORE2 Working
Group in collaboration with the ESC Cardiovascular Risk Collaboration,
the ERFC academic co-ordinating centre, and the MORGAM and
BiomarCaRE co-ordinating centres. Data used for the current study are
available upon reasonable request and approval of the individual cohorts
or collaborative groups, please contact the individual cohorts used for
the current study for details. Stata code for calculation of the SCORE2
algorithms is available on request from authors.

Results
Model derivation involved 677 684 participants from 45 cohorts
without previous CVD recruited between 1990 and 2009. Mean age
at recruitment was 57 (SD 9) years, 300 735 (44%) were male (Table
1). During median follow-up of 10.7 (5th, 95th percentile; 5.0, 18.6)
years, a total of 30 121 CVD events and 33 809 non-CVD deaths
were recorded. Subdistribution hazard ratios are shown in
Supplementary material online, Table S7. The strength of associations
of model predictors decreased with older age of participants
(Supplementary material online, Figure S2). Associations of smoking
and diabetes mellitus with CVD were stronger in women than men.
Calibration and 'goodness of fit' for the prediction models were

>40 years recruited across 23 UK-based assessment centres during
2006-10, and followed-up for cause-specific morbidity and mortality
through linkages to routinely available national datasets and disease-specific registers. Data selection for model derivation is shown in
Supplementary material online, Figure S1. Details of contributing cohorts
are provided in Supplementary material online, Appendix S1 and Table S1.
For recalibration of models, we obtained country-specific CVD mortality rates reported by the World Health Organization (WHO),13 and
estimated fatal and non-fatal CVD incidences by using age- and sex-specific multipliers. Multipliers were derived in the Clinical Practice Research
Datalink (CPRD),14 the Finnish CVD register,15 the Swedish population
data (linked to the Swedish National Inpatient and cause of death registries),16 the Estonian Biobank,17 and the Health, Alcohol and Psychosocial
factors In Eastern Europe (HAPPIEE) study.18 Details of these data sources are provided in Supplementary material online, Table S2 and Appendix
S1. Age- and sex-specific risk factor values were obtained from the NonCommunicable Disease Risk Factor Collaboration (NCD-RisC).19,20 The
incidence rates predicted by the recalibrated models for low- and moderate-risk regions were then compared with 2018 incidence rates as
reported in national registry data from the Netherlands, Denmark, UK,
Germany, and Spain (Supplementary material online, Table S3).
For external validation of models, we included prospective cohort studies
if they met the following criteria: did not contribute to the model derivation;
met the same criteria as for the cohorts selected from the ERFC for the
model derivation stage; and made individual-participant data available to our
working group. The following consortia and individual studies were used for
external validation: the MOnica Risk, Genetics, Archiving and Monograph
(MORGAM) project,21 the Biomarker for Cardiovascular Risk Assessment
in Europe (BiomarCaRE) consortium,22 the European Prospective
Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition-cardiovascular disease (EPICCVD),23 CPRD,14 Heinz-Nixdorf Recall study (HNR),24 Estonian Biobank,17
HAPIEE study,18 HUNT study,25 DETECT study,26 and Gutenberg Health
Study (GHS).27 Details of these cohorts are provided in the Supplementary
material online, Appendix S1 and Table S4.
The primary outcome was CVD, defined as a composite of cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction and non-fatal stroke. The
CVD mortality component of the primary outcomes corresponds to the
endpoint definition of the original SCORE model and includes death due
to coronary heart disease, heart failure, stroke, and sudden death.5
Follow-up was until the first non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal
stroke, death, or end of the registration period. Deaths from non-CVD
causes were treated as competing events. Details of the different ICD-10
codes included in both the fatal and non-fatal components of the endpoint are provided in Supplementary material online, Table S5.

BiomarCaRE consortium (Supplementary material online, Table S9).
Regional sex- and age-specific multipliers for conversion of CVD
mortality rates to incidence rates involved 5 256 013 men and 5 520
453 women, with 731 265 CVD events recorded during follow-up
(Supplementary material online, Table S2). Multipliers were similar
over calendar time, and across different data sources within each risk
region, but decreased with age, were somewhat greater in women
than men, and were lower in the high-/very high-risk regions compared with low-/moderate-risk regions (Supplementary material online, Table S10 and Figures S3-S5). Age- and sex-specific mean risk
factor levels used for recalibration are presented by region in
Supplementary material online, Figure S6. Age- and sex-specific 10year mortality CVD rates and derived incidence rates are shown for
each region in Supplementary material online, Figures S7 and S8. After
recalibration, the SCORE2 predicted risks based on mean risk factor
levels showed good agreement with the estimated CVD event incidence (Supplementary material online, Figure S9) and with incidence
rates obtained from external national registries (Supplementary material online, Figure S10).
The SCORE2 charts for CVD risk estimation in four European risk
regions are shown in the Figure 3. For practical and presentational
purposes, the charts are displayed according to non-HDL-cholesterol rather than total cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol. The estimated absolute risk for a given age and combination of risk factors
differed substantially across regions. For example, the estimated 10-

four groupings were: low risk (<100 CVD deaths per 100,000), moderate risk (100 to <150 CVD deaths per 100,000), high risk (150 to <300 CVD
deaths per 100,000), and very high risk (>_300 CVD deaths per 100,000).

year CVD risk for a 50-year-old male smoker and with a systolic
blood pressure of 140 mmHg, total cholesterol of 5.5 mmol/L and
HDL-cholesterol of 1.3 mmol/L, ranged from 5.9% in low-risk countries to 14.0% in very high-risk countries. Similarly, the 10-year risk
for a 50-year-old woman with the same risk factor profile ranged
from 4.2% in low-risk countries to 13.7% in very high-risk countries
(Supplementary material online, Figure S11).
External validation of risk models involved calculation of C-indices using data from 1 133 181 individuals without previous CVD or
diabetes in 25 prospective studies from 15 European countries (43
492 CVD events were observed). C-indices showed moderate-togood discrimination in all regions (Figure 4), with cohort-specific

values ranging from 0.67 (0.65-0.68) to 0.81 (0.76-0.86). In comparison to SCORE, SCORE2 improved overall risk discrimination
(difference in C-index: 0.0100, 95% CI 0.0085, 0.0115; P < 0.001),
particularly at younger ages (difference in C-index at ages 40-
50 years: 0.0213, 95% CI 0.0162, 0.0265; P < 0.001), and for nonfatal CVD outcomes (difference in C-index: 0.0113, 95% CI 0.0097,
0.0130; P < 0.001; Supplementary material online, Tables S11 and
S12 and Figure S12). Removing the contribution of total and HDLcholesterol from SCORE2 model reduced C-index by 0.0078 (95%
CI 0.0064, 0.0091), providing context for the C-index improvement of 0.01 observed in using SCORE2 rather than SCORE. To

the Management of Dyslipidaemias (i.e. to multiply estimates by 3

SCORE by avoiding over-estimation of risk (Supplementary material online, Figure S13) and by appropriately classifying as high-risk
individuals with higher observed lifetime CVD risk (Supplementary
material online, Figure S14).
When we applied recalibrated SCORE2 models to simulated
data representing populations from each risk region, the proportion of individuals aged 40-69 years with an estimated risk greater
than 10% varied by region, from 3.4% in the low-risk region to 51%
in the very high-risk region in men and from 0.1% to 32%,

respectively, in women, with these proportions increasing with
age, as would be expected (Figure 5 and Supplementary material
online, Figure S15).

Discussion
We have developed SCORE2, an updated algorithm tailored to
European populations to predict 10-year risk of first-onset CVD
(Graphical Abstract). By updating SCORE in several aspects, the use of
SCORE2 will enhance the identification of individuals at higher risk of
developing CVD across Europe.

bias can lead to low estimates of absolute risk, relative risks are generally unaffected.36 Furthermore, our approach makes the assumption that the relative risks obtained in the derivation dataset are
transferable across different populations, as evidenced by broadly
similar relative risk and good discrimination in external validation
populations in all regions. We then recalibrated models using nationally representative incidence rates from all regions, an important step
not commonly considered by other CVD risk scores, avoiding the
limitations of mis-calibration provided by potentially non-representative incidence rates in cohort studies.6,8,9
Data on medication use, family history, socio-economic status,
nutrition, physical activity, renal function, or ethnicity were not
available in cohorts and registries used for model derivation and
recalibration. Hence, interpretation of SCORE2 estimates may require clinical judgement, especially for individuals in whom these
factors may be relevant (e.g. those taking lipid or blood pressurelowering treatments,37 with a family history of CVD,38 with chronic kidney disease,39 or in at-risk socio-economic and ethnic
groups38). In addition, some individuals in our model derivation
cohorts may have initiated preventative treatment (e.g. statin) during follow-up and accounting for this could improve model calibration and discrimination. However, previous analyses have
suggested that inclusion of information on statin-initiation during
follow-up provides only limited clinical and public health benefit.40
We did not compare the performance of SCORE2 models with
other risk equations already developed for use in specific high-income countries because these equations contain variables often
not available in European datasets used for derivation and recalibration. However, previous analyses have suggested that only
minor differences exist in risk discrimination among guideline-recommended risk prediction models. In contrast, the clinical performance of risk prediction models depends importantly on
differing ability to predict the correct level risk in the target population (i.e. extent of 'calibration').30 We, therefore, ensured
SCORE2 was well-calibrated to current absolute risk levels for
each European region by adapting the model to contemporary
CVD incidence rates. We did not assess calibration of SCORE2 in
our external validation cohorts other than the large nationally representative dataset from the CPRD, because these cohorts do not
necessarily reflect contemporary absolute risk levels across
European regions. We did not include diabetes as a risk predictor
in SCORE2 as individuals with diabetes are generally considered at
high risk of CVD (and, therefore, automatically eligible for statin
medications and other preventive interventions), and specific risk
scores already exist for this population.41,42 For individuals over
the age of 70, a separate risk score, SCORE2-OP, has been derived
and published in parallel with the SCORE2 initiative using similar
methods.29 The SCORE2-OP risk estimation can be used as a continuum to the SCORE2 estimates. However, some small differences may be expected when estimating risks in individuals around
the age of 70 years.
To recalibrate SCORE2 to the target European populations, we
used CVD mortality rates provided by the WHO, rescaled to estimate CVD event incidence rates, based on multipliers derived from
representative cohort studies or national registries from three of the
four risk regions we defined in Europe. For the very high-risk region,
we did not have suitable data for deriving the multipliers, and

First, SCORE2 provides risk estimates for the combined outcome
of fatal and non-fatal CVD events, in contrast with SCORE's use of
CVD mortality only. Furthermore, SCORE2 has been systematically
recalibrated, using the most contemporary and representative CVD
rates available, whereas the original SCORE model was based on
data collected before 1986. Although it would have been possible to
recalibrate SCORE to contemporary CVD mortality rates, CVD
mortality-only risk models underestimate total risk, particularly when
the case-fatality rates are lower (as in younger individuals). Our
results suggest that SCORE2 better estimates the total burden of
CVD, particularly among younger individuals, as well as showing better risk discrimination, than SCORE.
Second, SCORE2 accounts for the impact of competing risks by
non-CVD deaths whereas SCORE did not do so. This statistical adjustment prevents over-estimation of CVD risk and over-estimation
of the benefit of treatment in populations where the risk of competing non-CVD deaths is high. For example, this adjustment should predominantly benefit treatment decisions in older individuals, and those
from high- or very high-risk regions.
Third, the recalibration of SCORE2 to four distinct European
regions defined by varying CVD risk levels improves on the two-level
regional stratification provided by SCORE.5 Furthermore, as the
recalibration used for SCORE2 avoids reliance on sparse cohort or
country-level data, it provides recalibrated calculators tailored to
sex-specific CVD rates and risk factor levels of each region. Because
the recalibration approach we used is based on registry data, the
model can be readily updated to reflect future disease CVD incidence
and risk factor profiles of any target population of apparently healthy
individuals to be screened.28,29 This means that if descriptive age- and
sex-specific epidemiological data are available from individual
European countries (or within-country regions), they can be readily
incorporated to revise models at a country level.4
Fourth, the derivation, calibration, validation, and illustration of
SCORE2 have been underpinned by exceptionally powerful, extensive, and complementary datasets of contemporary relevance to
European populations. These features enhance the accuracy, generalizability, and validity of the approach. In particular, SCORE2 was
developed using data on a total of more than 12.5 million individuals
from dozens of countries.
Fifth, our project illustrated the performance of SCORE2 with
data estimated from all European countries, showing that the proportions of individuals in specific risk categories seem to differ across
countries. This diversity highlights why policymakers and practitioners need tailored tools like SCORE2 to help make more appropriate and locally informed decisions about the allocation of
prevention resources.
The potential limitations of this effort merit consideration. We
derived risk prediction models from 45 cohorts, mostly in European
regions and populations at low- or moderate-risk CVD risk. Ideally,
however, the derivation of risk models for use in high and very highrisk countries would have involved large nationally representative,
prospective cohorts in these countries, coupled with prolonged follow-up and validation of fatal and non-fatal CVD endpoints.
Unfortunately, such data do not yet generally exist. Indeed, even in
low- and moderate-risk regions, the cohorts involved may not be nationally representative, reflecting past periods of time or self-selected
participants such as healthy volunteers.35 While healthy volunteer

therefore applied the same multipliers as for the high-risk region.
Our approach assumes that CVD mortality rates provided by WHO
are representative of each country, and that multipliers are valid
across countries within the same region, an assumption that is difficult
to test due to the lack of available incidence data in particular in the
high- and very high-risk regions. However, we observed that multipliers were similar across available studies from the same region and
over calendar time, suggesting that they are stable despite differences
in CVD event rates. Furthermore, estimated CVD rates agreed well
with national incidence rates from available independent external
registries. Our risk models might have underestimated CVD risk because data used to estimate multipliers were likely to include some
people already on CVD prevention therapies (e.g. statins or antihypertensive medication), but available data were insufficient to
evaluate this possibility. As we have not evaluated SCORE2 in nonEuropean populations, its value in such settings is not entirely known.
Finally, further studies should assess the value of longer-term risk prediction (especially in younger individuals),40 understand barriers to
implementations,43 and define the role of using CVD risk prediction
models in primary CVD prevention.44,45
In summary, SCORE2, a new algorithm derived, calibrated, and
validated to predict 10-year risk of first-onset CVD in European populations, enhances the identification of individuals at higher risk of
developing CVD across Europe.
