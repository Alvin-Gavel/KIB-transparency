Aims

The aim of this study was to examine the effect of dapagliflozin on the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias and
sudden death in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
In a post hoc analysis of DAPA-HF, we examined serious adverse event reports related to ventricular arrhythmias
and results
or cardiac arrest, in addition to adjudicated sudden death. The effect of dapagliflozin, compared with placebo, on

the composite of the first occurrence of any serious ventricular arrhythmia, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or sudden
death was examined using Cox proportional hazards models. A serious ventricular arrhythmia was reported in 115
(2.4%) of the 4744 patients in DAPA-HF (ventricular fibrillation in 15 patients, ventricular tachycardia in 86, 'other'
ventricular arrhythmia/tachyarrhythmia in 12, and torsade de pointes in 2 patients). A total of 206 (41%) of the 500
cardiovascular deaths occurred suddenly. Eight patients survived resuscitation from cardiac arrest. Independent predictors of the composite outcome (first occurrence of any serious ventricular arrhythmia, resuscitated cardiac arrest or sudden death), ranked by chi-square value, were log-transformed N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide,
history of ventricular arrhythmia, left ventricular ejection fraction, systolic blood pressure, history of myocardial infarction, male sex, body mass index, serum sodium concentration, non-white race, treatment with dapagliflozin,
and cardiac resynchronization therapy. Of participants assigned to dapagliflozin, 140/2373 patients (5.9%) experienced the composite outcome compared with 175/2371 patients (7.4%) in the placebo group [hazard ratio 0.79
(95% confidence interval 0.63-0.99), P = 0.037], and the effect was consistent across each of the components of
the composite outcome.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusions
Dapagliflozin reduced the risk of any serious ventricular arrhythmia, cardiac arrest, or sudden death when added to
conventional therapy in patients with HFrEF.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor

Introduction
Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have recently
been shown to reduce both worsening heart failure and death
from cardiovascular causes in patients with heart failure and
reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).1-4 Ventricular arrhythmias are
common and are one of the key causes of death in HFrEF, as
indicated by the benefit of implantable cardioverter defibrillators
(ICDs) on sudden death.5-9 Although rates of sudden death have
been declining over the past three decades with improving
pharmacological therapy, this mode of death remains the principal
cause of mortality in ambulatory patients with HFrEF, particularly
those with mild symptoms.10
It is important, therefore, to investigate the effect of new therapies
for HFrEF on ventricular arrhythmias and mode of death, including
sudden death. Various proposed actions of SGLT2 inhibitors raise
the hypothesis that these agents might reduce the risk of ventricular
arrhythmias. Potential antiarrhythmic actions include favourable
effects on left ventricular loading conditions and remodelling, autonomic nervous system activity, serum electrolytes, the cardiac

Therefore, to investigate the hypothesis that SGLT2 inhibition

Study patients

Study procedures
After the provision of informed consent, visit 1 started a 14-day screening
period during which the trial inclusion and exclusion criteria were
checked, and baseline information was collected. Visit 2 was the randomization visit and after randomization, follow-up visits took place at 14 and
60 days, and then at 120, 240, and 360 days and every 4 months
thereafter.

Prespecified trial outcomes
The primary outcome in DAPA-HF was the composite of an episode
of worsening heart failure or cardiovascular death, whichever occurred
first. Secondary endpoints included the composite of the occurrence
of heart failure hospitalization or cardiovascular death and all-cause
death. The primary composite outcome in the present analysis was
the time-to-first occurrence of any 'serious' ventricular arrhythmia,
resuscitated cardiac arrest, or sudden death, as discussed in more detail below.

Adjudication of death
All deaths were adjudicated according to prespecified criteria and subclassified as due to a cardiovascular cause, a non-cardiovascular cause, or
an undetermined cause. Cardiovascular deaths were further subclassified
into the following categories: sudden death, heart failure or cardiogenic
shock ('pump failure'), acute myocardial infarction, stroke, and others
(e.g. procedure-related). Sudden death included: (i) witnessed and instantaneous death without new or worsening symptoms, (ii) death witnessed within 60 min of the onset of new or worsening cardiac
symptoms, (iii) death witnessed and attributed to an identified arrhythmia, e.g. captured on an electrocardiographic recording or witnessed on
a monitor, or unwitnessed but found on ICD review, (iv) death after unsuccessful resuscitation from cardiac arrest or a patient successfully
resuscitated from cardiac arrest but who died within 24 h without identification of a non-cardiac aetiology, (v) death >1 day after a patient has
been successfully resuscitated from cardiac arrest and without identification of a non-cardiovascular aetiology, and (vi) unwitnessed death in a
subject seen alive and clinically stable <_24 h before being found dead
without any evidence supporting a specific non-cardiovascular cause of
death.

Identification of ventricular arrhythmias
reported as serious adverse events
Because of the extensive safety information on dapagliflozin and
SGLT2 inhibitors, selective adverse event reporting was employed in
DAPA-HF. While all SAEs were collected, only non-SAEs associated
with discontinuation of trial treatment and prespecified 'non-SAEs of
interest' (specifically, volume depletion, renal events, major

.. hypoglycaemic events, bone fractures, diabetic ketoacidosis, and ampu..
.. tations) were collected.
..
Serious adverse events were examined for any report of any ventricu..
.. lar arrhythmia. The adverse events were identified using the Medical
.. Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) preferred terms 'ven..
.. tricular tachycardia' (VT) (including sustained and non-sustained VT),
.. 'ventricular fibrillation' (VF), 'torsade de pointes', 'ventricular tachyar.. rhythmia', and 'ventricular arrhythmia'.
..
..
..
.. Analysis of ventricular arrhythmias and
.. sudden death
..
.. The primary outcome in the present analysis was the time-to-first occur.. rence of any 'serious' ventricular arrhythmia, resuscitated cardiac arrest,
..
.. or sudden death. For this analysis, a 'serious' ventricular arrhythmia was
.. defined as VT, VF, torsade de pointes, ventricular tachyarrhythmia and
.. ventricular arrhythmia (reflecting MedDRA preferred terms used for
..
.. reporting SAEs). Premature ventricular ectopic beats were not included
.. in this analysis. For participants who experienced more than one type of
..
.. ventricular arrhythmia, only the first event reported was included in the
.. analysis of the composite endpoint.
..
Serious adverse event reports of cardiac arrest were also examined
..
.. and patients who were resuscitated from cardiac arrest were included in
.. this analysis if the cardiac arrest was adjudicated as being non-fatal.
..
..
..
.. Statistical analysis
.. Baseline characteristics were compared for patients experiencing any
.. component of the composite outcome of any serious ventricular arrhyth..
.. mia, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or sudden death and patients who did
.. not. Categorical variables are reported as whole numbers with percen..
.. tages. Continuous variables are reported by their mean value with stand.. ard deviations or median value plus interquartile ranges depending on a
.. respective normal or skewed distribution. The effect of dapagliflozin
..
.. compared with placebo was examined in a time-to-first event analysis
.. using Cox proportional hazards regression models. The primary models
..
.. included factors for randomized treatment group assignment and history
.. of heart failure hospitalization and the randomization stratification vari.. able of diabetes status. In addition, we examined the effect of dapagliflo..
.. zin, compared with placebo, on the narrower composite of VT, VF, or
.. torsade de pointes (i.e. excluding the MedDRA preferred terms 'ventricu..
.. lar tachyarrhythmia' and 'ventricular arrhythmia'). In sensitivity analyses,
.. we excluded non-sustained VT from both the primary composite out.. come and the narrower composite. Event rates per 100 person-years
..
.. were calculated and are presented with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
.. The cumulative incidences of outcomes are presented graphically using
..
.. the Kaplan-Meier method. The effect of randomized treatment was
.. examined in Cox proportional hazards regression models, and the inter.. action with randomized therapy tested in several subgroups: patients
..
.. with an ischaemic or non-ischaemic aetiology for heart failure, patients
.. with or without an implanted defibrillating device [ICD or cardiac
..
.. resynchronization therapy with a defibrillator (CRT-D)] at baseline,
.. patients treated with or not treated with a mineralocorticoid receptor
.. antagonist (MRA), patients with or without diabetes, patients with or
..
.. without a history of ventricular arrhythmia, patients with a diagnosis of
.. heart failure within 1 year or for >1 year before randomization, and
..
.. patients who were in NYHA class II or III/IV. Baseline LVEF, NT-proBNP,
.. and systolic blood pressure subgroups were analysed both as a categoric.. al variable (divided at the median) and a continuous variable (using frac..
.. tional polynomial models). These variables were chosen because:
.. (i) patients with an ischaemic aetiology are at greater risk of sudden death
.. than those with a non-ischaemic aetiology and there seems to be an inter..
. action between aetiology and the effectiveness of an ICD. (ii) We wanted

Men and women aged >_18 years with heart failure were eligible if they
were in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II-IV, had
a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <_40%, and were optimally
treated with pharmacological and device therapy for HFrEF. Participants
were also required to have an elevated N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic
peptide (NT-proBNP) concentration. Key exclusion criteria included:
symptoms of hypotension or systolic blood pressure <95 mmHg, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (or rapidly
declining renal function), type 1 diabetes mellitus, and another condition
likely to prevent patient participation in the trial or greatly limit life expectancy. A full list of exclusion criteria is provided in the design paper.

A P-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical
analyses were performed using Stata 17 (Stata Corp., College Station,
TX, USA).

Results
At least one episode of a serious ventricular arrhythmia was reported
in 115 (2.4%) of the 4744 patients in DAPA-HF. The events reported
were VT in 87 patients (86 as a first event), VF in 16 patients (15 as a
first event), torsade de pointes in 2 patients (2 as a first event), a 'ventricular tachyarrhythmia' in 1 patient (1 as a first event), and a 'ventricular arrhythmia' in 13 patients (11 as a first event). Among
patients experiencing VT, 7 patients reported to have a 'non-sustained VT' event (6 as a first event) and 4 reported a 'paroxysmal VT'
event (3 as a first event), identified by MedDRA low-level terms. Of
the 500 cardiovascular deaths, 206 (41%) were adjudicated as sudden
death. Overall, 23 patients (0.5%) had a documented cardiac arrest,
of whom 8 (35%) survived. A total of 315 patients (6.6%) experienced the composite of a serious ventricular arrhythmia (104 as the
first event in the composite), resuscitated cardiac arrest (8 as the first
event), or sudden death (203 as the first event). A total of 8 patients
had the same time to the occurrence of a serious ventricular arrhythmia and sudden death and were counted as sudden death in the analysis of the composite outcome. Similarly, one patient who had the
same time to the occurrence of a serious ventricular arrhythmia and
resuscitated cardiac arrest was counted as a resuscitated cardiac arrest in the analysis of the primary composite outcome.

Baseline characteristics
Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of patients who did and did
not experience the primary composite outcome in this analysis (serious ventricular arrhythmia, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or sudden
death). Compared to patients who did not experience the composite
outcome, patients who did were more likely to be male, have a history of ischaemic heart disease and ventricular arrhythmia, and had a
lower LVEF, higher NT-proBNP, longer duration of heart failure,
worse renal function, a broader QRS, and greater symptom burden
at baseline (as reflected by NYHA functional class and KCCQ Total
Symptom Score). More patients who experienced a composite event
were treated with an MRA and had an ICD at baseline. Background
treatment with beta-blockers was high in both groups, although
slightly fewer patients who experienced the composite outcome
were taking a beta-blocker at baseline. The baseline characteristics of
patients with any serious ventricular arrhythmia or sudden death,
separately, are shown in Supplementary material online, Appendix
Table S1.

Predictors of any serious ventricular
arrhythmia, resuscitated cardiac arrest,
or sudden death
Independent predictors of the composite outcome, ranked by v2
value, were log-transformed NT-proBNP, history of ventricular
arrhythmia, LVEF, systolic blood pressure, history of myocardial infarction, male sex, body mass index, serum sodium concentration,
non-white race, treatment with dapagliflozin, and CRT (Table 2).

to examine the effectiveness of dapagliflozin added to other treatments
reducing the risk of ventricular arrhythmias/sudden death. The only
pharmacological treatment subgroup reasonable to do this was MRA
therapy (70% yes/30% no); the other relevant therapies had too many
(>_94% on a renin-angiotensin system blocker and a beta-blocker) or too
few receiving the treatment [angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor
(ARNI) 11%]. (iii) The ICD/CRT-D subgroup was chosen for the same
reason as (ii) and we wondered if dapagliflozin might have more effect in
patients without an ICD/CRT-D. (iv) NYHA class, NT-proBNP, systolic
blood pressure, and time from diagnosis of heart failure were all chosen
as recognized markers of severity of heart failure; ICDs are not indicated
in patients with more severe heart failure symptoms because of the relatively higher competing risk of pump-failure death and we were interested to see whether dapagliflozin was less effective in reducing
ventricular arrhythmias/sudden death in patients with evidence of more
severe/advanced heart failure. (v) LVEF is a well-known predictor of sudden death and arrhythmias and the primary determinant of whether there
is an indication for an ICD. (vi) Patients with a previous ventricular arrhythmia were a subset at high risk of the events of interest. (vii) Diabetes
mellitus-this was included because HFrEF patients with diabetes have a
higher risk of sudden death than those without diabetes and ICDs seem
to be less effective in patients with diabetes. To account for the fact that
death precludes the future occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias, a proportional hazards competing-risk regression model was used as a sensitivity analysis.22 To examine the relative hazard of clinical outcomes before
or after the occurrence of any serious ventricular arrhythmia, Cox
proportional hazards regression models were performed with the occurrence of the serious ventricular arrhythmia outcome modelled as a timevarying covariate.23 A multivariable model was adjusted for factors
known to influence prognosis including beta-blocker use, angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker use, ARNI
use, MRA use, ischaemic aetiology, LVEF, presence of an ICD or a CRT
device, NYHA class, hypertension, diabetes, history of hospitalization for
heart failure, log-transformed NT-proBNP, and atrial fibrillation.
The association between relative change in NT-proBNP from baseline to 8 months (using log2-transformed values), adjusted for baseline
NT-proBNP, and the incidence of serious ventricular arrhythmia,
resuscitated cardiac arrest, or sudden death was examined using Cox
proportional hazards linear models. For this analysis, only events
occurring after 8 months were included. The association between
baseline LVEF and NT-proBNP as continuous variables and the primary composite outcome were examined in linear models and
reported graphically.
A backward stepwise logistic regression multivariable model was constructed with a P-value threshold of <0.1 to identify baseline variables
predicting the occurrence of the composite serious ventricular arrhythmia, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or sudden death. Variables included in
the model were: age, region, sex, QRS duration, eGFR, race, systolic
blood pressure, heart rate, body mass index, LVEF, log-transformed NTproBNP, serum potassium, serum sodium, NYHA functional class, ischaemic aetiology for heart failure, Kansas City Cardiomyopathy
Questionnaire (KCCQ) total symptom score, history of ventricular arrhythmia, hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, myocardial infarction, stroke, percutaneous coronary
intervention or coronary bypass grafting, ICD, CRT, and anaemia.
Randomized treatment and prior heart failure hospitalization were fixed
factors in the model. Odds ratios with 95% CIs are presented. The effect
of individual variables on the logistic regression model was examined and
a v2 value calculated using a post-estimation test. Randomization treatment and a history of heart failure hospitalization were forced into the
model.

Serious ventricular arrhythmia was defined as any serious adverse event report using the MedDRA preferred terms 'ventricular tachycardia', 'ventricular fibrillation', 'torsade
de pointes', 'ventricular tachyarrhythmia', and 'ventricular arrhythmia'. Premature ventricular ectopic beats were excluded.

When modelled continuously (using an NT-proBNP value of
1440 pg/mL, approximating to the median, as the referent value),
higher NT-proBNP was associated with a greater risk of a primary
composite event and baseline values below the median were associated with a lower risk. An inverse relationship was observed between
baseline LVEF, modelled continuously, and the primary composite
outcome (Supplementary material online, Appendix Figures S1 and
S2).

Effect of randomized treatment on the
incidence of any serious ventricular
arrhythmia, resuscitated cardiac arrest,

had a lower rate of the composite of any serious ventricular arrhythmia, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or sudden death, whichever
occurred first [hazard ratio (HR) 0.79 (95% CI 0.63-0.99), P = 0.037]
(Figure 1). We conducted a sensitivity analysis including only VT, VF,
and torsade de pointes as the ventricular arrhythmia component of
the composite (i.e. excluding events reported as 'ventricular tachyarrhythmia' and 'ventricular arrhythmia'). This analysis of VT, VF, torsade de pointes, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or sudden death also
occurred less frequently in patients treated with dapagliflozin compared to placebo [HR 0.77 (95% CI 0.62-0.97), P = 0.025]. The effect
of dapagliflozin compared to placebo on the incidence of any 'serious'
ventricular arrhythmia [HR 0.76 (95% CI 0.53-1.10)]; VT, VF, or torsade de pointes [HR 0.72 (95% CI 0.49-1.07)]; and sudden death [HR
0.81 (95% CI 0.62-1.07)] was consistent with the effect on the primary composite outcome. In further sensitivity analyses, we excluded
non-sustained VT from both the primary composite outcome and
the narrower composite of VT, VF, torsade de pointes, resuscitated

cardiac arrest, or sudden death; the findings of these analyses were
consistent with the analyses reported above (Table 3). Although
there were numerically more resuscitated cardiac arrests in the dapagliflozin group (5 vs. 3 in the placebo group), the overall number of
events was small. Analysis modelling all-cause mortality as a competing risk also gave similar results (Supplementary material online,
Appendix Table S2 and Figure S3) for the primary composite outcome,
the sensitivity analysis, and the analysis of the individual components
of these composites.

Effect of dapagliflozin on any serious
ventricular arrhythmia, resuscitated
cardiac arrest, or sudden death in key
subgroups
The effect of dapagliflozin on the composite outcome in key subgroups is shown in Table 4. While most showed no suggestion of heterogeneity of treatment effect, two are worthy of comment. Of the
1242 patients with a defibrillating device (ICD or CRT-D) implanted
at baseline, 102 (8.2%) experienced at least one ventricular arrhythmia. Among the 3502 participants without a defibrillating device, 213
(6.1%) experienced either a serious ventricular arrhythmia, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or sudden death. The HR for the effect of dapagliflozin, compared with placebo, on this composite outcome in
patients with an ICD/CRT-D was 0.99 (95% CI 0.67-1.45), compared
with 0.71 (95% CI 0.54-0.93) in those without such a device. Despite
the apparently smaller effect in patients with a defibrillating device,
the P-value for interaction was not significant (=0.174).
Of the 2372 patients with a baseline NT-proBNP at or below the
median, 121 (5.1%) experienced the primary composite event. A
total of 194 of 2370 (8.2%) patients with a baseline NT-proBNP
above the median experienced one of the composite events. The HR

for the effect of dapagliflozin, compared with placebo, on the composite outcome in patients with an NT-proBNP at or below the median was 0.58 (0.40-0.84) compared with 0.96 (0.72-1.27) in those
with an NT-proBNP above the median. The P-value for interaction
was 0.032 (Table 4). When the interaction was tested using NTproBNP modelled as a continuous variable, the P-value for interaction was 0.056.

Association between change in NTproBNP and occurrence of any serious
ventricular arrhythmia, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or sudden death
Change in NT-proBNP between baseline and 8 months was analysed
in 4222 patients (89.0%). An increase in NT-proBNP, adjusted for
baseline value, was associated with a higher risk of any serious ventricular arrhythmia, resuscitated cardiac arrest or sudden death [HR
per doubling of NT-proBNP, 1.55 (95% CI 1.33-1.81)], whereas a decrease in NT-proBNP was associated with a lower risk [HR per halving of NT-proBNP, 0.65 (95% CI 0.55-0.75)] (Supplementary
material online, Appendix Figure S4).

Association between a report of any
serious ventricular arrhythmia and
subsequent mortality
When the occurrence of a serious ventricular arrhythmia was modelled as a time-varying covariate, there was a strong association with
mortality. For a serious ventricular arrhythmia, the unadjusted HR for
subsequent death from any causes was 2.16 (95% CI 1.31-3.56)
(P = 0.002). The corresponding adjusted HR was 2.09 (95% CI 1.26-
3.45) (P = 0.004).

Discussion
The main finding of this analysis was that dapagliflozin reduced the
risk of the composite outcome of an investigator-reported serious
ventricular arrhythmia, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or sudden death
in patients with HFrEF (Graphical Abstract).
In DAPA-HF, ventricular arrhythmias were identified through adverse event reporting by investigators, rather than by systematic
monitoring. Although systematic approaches to arrhythmia detection
using techniques such as ambulatory monitoring identify ventricular
arrhythmias in most patients with HFrEF, arrhythmias reported spontaneously as SAEs are likely to be the most clinically important. Using
a similar analytical approach, we found an almost identical rate of 'serious' ventricular arrhythmias in PARADIGM-HF (unpublished data)
and the rates of appropriate ICD therapy reported in generally similar patient populations are broadly in keeping with the rates of 'serious' ventricular arrhythmias in DAPA-HF and PARADIGM-HF,
accounting for background therapy and other differences.24 The view
that the events reported are more clinically significant is supported
by the high subsequent mortality rate in patients with an SAE report
of this type in DAPA-HF. We found that an investigator-reported
ventricular arrhythmia, analysed as a time-varying covariate, was associated with a doubling of the risk of death and this elevated risk persisted after adjustment for other prognostic variables, including
NT-proBNP. The independent predictors of the primary endpoint
were NT-proBNP concentration, history of ventricular arrhythmia,
LVEF, history of myocardial infarction, body mass index, systolic
blood pressure, male sex, and serum sodium concentration, in keeping with prior reports.24,25
The risk of any ventricular arrhythmia, resuscitated cardiac arrest,
or sudden death was decreased by 21% when dapagliflozin was added
to other treatments previously shown to reduce ventricular

arrhythmias and sudden death, including beta-blockers, MRAs, and
sacubitril/valsartan.25-30 The findings in patients with and without a
defibrillating device (an ICD or CRT-D) were of particular interest.
Dapagliflozin appeared to substantially reduce the primary endpoint
in patients without a defibrillating device and to have little effect in
patients with such devices. However, the P-value for the interaction
between the effect of dapagliflozin and baseline device status was
non-significant and the device subgroup was of modest size and had
relatively few events. However, it is plausible that dapagliflozin might
be less likely to reduce sudden death in patients with an ICD/CRT-D
compared to those without such a device. The effect of dapagliflozin
on a ventricular arrhythmia or sudden death seemed to be more

consistent regarding aetiology (non-ischaemic vs. ischaemic) and
baseline MRA therapy (we did not perform a subgroup analysis for
renin-angiotensin system blockers or beta-blockers because >90% of
participants were receiving both of these therapies).
We do not know of any other reports of the effect of SGLT2
inhibitors on ventricular arrhythmias in this patient group, although
empagliflozin has been shown to reduce the incidence of VF related
to ischaemia/reperfusion in Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts.31
There are several potential mechanisms by which SGLT2 inhibitors
might reduce ventricular arrhythmias. First, favourable haemodynamic and remodelling actions may have an indirect effect as chamber
dilatation and cardiomyocyte stretch are associated with the occurrence of arrhythmias. In three randomized trials in patients with
HFrEF, empagliflozin reduced cardiac chamber size and SGLT2

inhibitors also reduce NT-proBNP levels, suggesting that they decrease wall stress, at least in part due to their diuretic action.11-15
Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that both LVEF and NTproBNP were independent predictors of the composite outcome
and increasing NT-proBNP over time was associated with a higher
risk of ventricular arrhythmias, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or sudden
death. That the separation of the Kaplan-Meier curves for this composite outcome was clearest after 9 months might be consistent with
a role for favourable cardiac remodelling in the benefit of dapagliflozin. However, the relationship with NT-proBNP is complex in that
while higher NT-proBNP levels do predict a greater risk of sudden
death, NT-proBNP is a relatively more powerful predictor of death
due to progressive pump failure.32 Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2
inhibitors may also have a favourable effect on the autonomic

nervous system. In the EMBODY trial,16 empagliflozin improved both
sympathetic and parasympathetic activities in patients with myocardial infarction and type 2 diabetes, a finding supported by a study with
dapagliflozin in a pig model of heart failure.33 Empagliflozin does not
prolong QT interval in healthy humans and attenuated sotalolinduced QTc prolongation in rats.34,35 Experimentally, SGLT2
inhibitors also inhibit the cardiac sodium channel current (late INa) in
cardiomyocytes from mice with heart failure and in cardiac Nav1.5
sodium channels containing the long QT syndrome 3 mutations.18
More controversially, SGLT2 inhibitors may inhibit the myocardial
sodium/hydrogen (Nath/Hth) exchanger-1 (NHE-1), although this has
not been confirmed by all investigators.36-39 Additional possibilities
include a favourable effect on myocardial metabolism and energetics
and a reduction in epicardial adipose tissue, which may be associated
with a greater risk of arrhythmias.40-42
Our study had several limitations. First, this analysis was not prespecified. As a result, our findings should be regarded as hypothesis
generating and require confirmation, although a recent meta-analysis
of 22 trials involving 52 115 patients with a variety of conditions
(including type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and heart failure)
found that the use of an SGLT2 inhibitor was associated with a lower
risk of VT reported as an adverse event (relative risk 0.73, 95% CI
0.53-0.99).43 Second, adverse event reporting likely underestimated
the true prevalence of ventricular arrhythmias. We did not have information on ICD discharges. We were unable to tell whether the
higher incidence of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with devices
reflected why the device was implanted (i.e. for primary prevention
in a high-risk patient or because of a prior arrhythmia) or because
these devices detect arrhythmias. Arrhythmias were not adjudicated
although a prior similar study showed a reduction in arrhythmias with
a beta-blocker, consistent with the effect found in studies using systematic monitoring.44 Although ventricular arrhythmias are clearly
linked with sudden death, not all sudden deaths are due to an arrhythmia (or any electrical disturbance), which is why the risk of sudden death is not eliminated by ICDs. Conversely, ventricular
arrhythmias are also predictive of non-sudden death as they are often
a marker of more advanced heart failure.
In summary, in this post hoc analysis, dapagliflozin, compared with
placebo, reduced the incidence of investigator-reported (but not
adjudicated) ventricular arrhythmias in patients with HFrEF, most of
whom were treated with a renin-angiotensin system blocker, betablocker, and an MRA as well.
