major bleeding or all-cause death (non-inferiority analysis with 2.5% absolute risk difference as margin), and the
rate of patients discharged home within 24 h after randomization (NCT02811237). From January 2017 through July
2019, 1975 patients were included. In the per-protocol population, the primary outcome occurred in 3.82% (34/
891) in the Hestia arm and 3.57% (32/896) in the sPESI arm (P = 0.004 for non-inferiority). In the intention-to-treat
population, 38.4% of the Hestia patients (378/984) were treated at home vs. 36.6% (361/986) of the sPESI patients
(P = 0.41 for superiority), with a 30-day composite outcome rate of 1.33% (5/375) and 1.11% (4/359), respectively.
No recurrent or fatal PE occurred in either home treatment arm.

Introduction

Methods
Trial design
HOME-PE study was an international randomized open-label non-inferiority trial, to compare a triaging strategy based on the Hestia rule with a
strategy based on the sPESI for home treatment of patients with acute
PE. The detailed trial protocol is available in the Supplementary material
online. The trial was conducted in 26 hospitals from France (n = 15),
Belgium (n = 5), the Netherlands (n = 5), and Switzerland (n = 1). Among
them, 18 (69%) were university hospitals and 8 (31%) general hospitals.
Prior to study initiation, 9 (35%) centres had a very-low level, 8 (31%) a
low level, 5 (19%) an intermediate level and 4 (15%) a high level of experience in home treatment of patients with PE according to local investigators. There was no difference between university hospitals and general
hospitals, 12/18 (67%) and 5/8 (62%) having a low or very-low level of

International guidelines suggest home treatment in patients with lowrisk acute pulmonary embolism (PE), when home circumstances are
adequate.1,2 However, current evidence is mainly based on cohort
studies using different sets of eligibility criteria.3,4 Therefore, controversy persists about the optimal triaging strategy and eligibility criteria
for home treatment.3
The approach proposed by the European Society of Cardiology firstly
refers to a 30-day all-cause mortality risk assessment using the
Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (PESI) or the simplified PESI
(sPESI)1,5,6 (Table 1). The Hestia rule, a checklist of medical and social criteria precluding home treatment, is proposed as an alternative1,7 (Table
2). Although the Hestia rule was not primarily designed as a risk assessment model, the rate of complications in patients treated at home on
the basis of a negative Hestia rule was low in prospective cohort studies,
the 3-month mortality rate ranging from 0.5% to 1%.7-9 Moreover, the
strategy based on the Hestia rule may lead to a higher proportion of PE
patients treated at home than the strategy based on the sPESI.10 Indeed,
around 50% of normotensive PE patients were discharged home within
24 h of diagnosis in studies applying the Hestia rule alone.7-9 Conversely,
in studies using the PESI or the sPESI, medical or social exclusion criteria
complemented the index, leading to a proportion of patients treated at
home of <30%.11,12 However, the two strategies had never been prospectively compared head-to-head.
The aim of the present trial was to compare the safety and effectiveness of the Hestia rule vs. the sPESI for triaging PE patients for
home treatment, in the way they are applied in routine practice, i.e.
with the possibility of the physician to overrule the triaging tool result
and to take into account the patient's opinion in a shared decisionmaking. Our research hypothesis was that the 30-day rate of complications of a triaging strategy based on the Hestia rule would be noninferior to a strategy based on the sPESI and that the Hestia strategy
would lead to a higher rate of patients treated at home than the sPESI
strategy.

The sPESI score is the sum of the assigned points for each criterion. If the sPESI
score is 0 points, i.e. the patient classified as low 30-day risk of death, patient
qualification is home treatment. If the sPESI score is >0, i.e. the patient classified
as high 30-day risk of death, patient qualification is in-hospital treatment.

international guidelines, the choice of which was left to the discretion of
the physician-in-charge.2,13 All patients were followed for 90 days. They
were contacted within 3 days following randomization and at 14 +/- 3,
30 +/- 5, and 90 +/- 15 days.

Outcomes
The primary outcome of the study was the composite rate of recurrent
venous thrombo-embolism (VTE), major bleeding or all-cause death
within 30 days after randomization. Recurrent VTE was defined as symptomatic, objectively confirmed DVT, non-fatal or fatal PE. Major bleeding
was defined according to the criteria proposed by the International
Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis.14 All clinical events were adjudicated by an independent event adjudication committee, whose members
were unaware of group assignments.
The first secondary outcome was home treatment, strictly defined as
patients discharged home within 24 h following randomization. The exact
times of discharge were extracted from the patients' administrative report
forms, independently of patient allocation and whether the patient qualified
for home treatment. The second secondary outcome was qualification for
home treatment according to the allocated rule, i.e. patients meeting no criteria of the Hestia rule, or patients with an sPESI of 0 points.
We further assessed and compared the rate of the 30-day composite
outcome in patients treated at home. Lastly, we determined and compared the applicability of both triaging tools defined as the proportion of
patients who left the hospital in the first 24 h after randomization among
those who qualified for home treatment.

Statistical analysis
The analyses were performed in compliance with the CONSORT statement. The analyses for the primary outcome and the two main secondary
outcomes followed a hierarchical approach in three steps. The 1st step
was a non-inferiority analysis of the primary outcome for the Hestia vs.
the sPESI strategy and was performed in the per-protocol population by
logistic regression adjusted for hospital organization regarding PE.15 The
2nd and 3rd steps were two-sided difference superiority analyses, with an
alpha level set at 5% and were performed in the randomized population
with application of the intention-to-treat principle, using the same model
as for the primary outcome.
Protocol deviations were defined as disregarding of an inclusion and/or
exclusion criterion and/or of the recommended delay for home discharge
(patients designated for home treatment but discharged home more than

Figure 2 Selection for home treatment. The selection for home treatment included three steps. Step 1: Qualification for home treatment according to the allocated triaging tool. Patients randomized to the Hestia arm qualified for home treatment if all answers were negative. Patients randomized to the sPESI arm qualified for home treatment if the sPESI was 0 points. Step 2: Designation for home treatment according to the physician-incharge. In both study arms, for designation for home treatment and as per-protocol, the physician-in-charge could overrule the qualification issued
from the allocated triaging tool in case of imperative medical or social reasons, or patient's refusal. The reasons are mentioned in the lateral boxes.
Step 3: Final management. Patients were considered to have been treated at home if they were actually discharged within 24 h following randomization, calculated from the patients' administrative report forms. Protocol deviations were defined as patients designated for home treatment who
were discharged after the 24-h limit, or vice versa, as patients designated for hospitalization who were discharged before the 24-h limit. DOAC, direct

Discussion
Principal findings
In the HOME-PE study, the Hestia rule strategy was non-inferior
to the sPESI strategy for triaging normotensive PE patients for
home treatment, with respect to the 30-day composite complication rate. Compared with the sPESI, the Hestia rule qualified
fewer patients as eligible for home treatment but its applicability
was higher, because fewer home treatment qualifications were
overruled by the physician-in-charge taking into account the
patient's preference. Despite differences in the characteristics of
patients treated at home, the proportion of patients discharged
home within the 24 h following inclusion, did not differ between
the two strategies. More than a third of PE patients were treated
at home using either the Hestia rule or the sPESI, with a low 30day rate of complications (Graphical abstract).

of recurrent VTE and all-cause death in the overall HOME-PE population were lower than reported in historical cohorts of normotensive
PE patients.16,17 Improvement of hospital adherence to evidencebased guidelines, e.g. the introduction of risk stratification-based initial
management and direct oral anticoagulants, may have contributed to a
clear decrease in PE mortality over time.20,21
Contrary to our hypotheses, a lower proportion of patients was
qualified for home treatment with the Hestia rule than with the sPESI
and a similar proportion of patients was actually treated at home.
The 39.4% rate of patients with a negative Hestia rule was lower in
our study than in Dutch hospitals, which first described and used the
Hestia rule (51-55%),7,8 but higher than in two other studies
(27%).19,22 Conversely, the 48% rate of patients with an sPESI of 0
points was higher than the 28% rate in two other recent studies.19,23
Possible reasons for these discrepancies are differences in hospital
settings and patient characteristics as well as the way the triaging
tools are used. Indeed, both tools include measurements of three
vital signs: systolic blood pressure, pulse rate, and oxygen saturation.
Vital signs are dynamic and the use of one or another measurement
in the triaging assessment may change the qualification. Moreover,
some criteria of the Hestia rule, such as 'high risk for bleeding' and
'medical or social reason for admission', leave some room for the
physician's interpretation.19
One important feature of our trial is its pragmatic design allowing
reliable assessment of the effectiveness of the two triaging tools as
they are applied in everyday clinical practice.24 Indeed, the physicianin-charge had the possibility to overrule the qualification issued by
the triaging tool and to take into account the patient's opinion in the
decision-making process. This overruling occurred in 28.5% of
patients with an sPESI of 0 points, vs. in 3.4% of patients with a negative Hestia rule. As a result, the applicability of the Hestia rule was
higher than that of the sPESI. This difference is likely related to the

divergent original purposes of the two triaging rules, i.e. to predict
30-day mortality for the sPESI6 and to identify conditions precluding
home treatment for the Hestia rule.7 The sPESI cannot be applied as
a standalone rule to decide on the feasibility of home treatment. It
requires an implicit assessment of medical or social conditions precluding home treatment. The addition of these implicit criteria to the
sPESI criteria could have resulted in a lower proportion of patients
sent home than when only the explicit Hestia criteria would have
been used. For instance, according to sPESI, patients older than
80 years or with cancer or cardiorespiratory disease are precluded
from home treatment. The proportion of these patients treated at
home was therefore higher in the Hestia arm than in the sPESI arm.
The same findings were observed in a retrospective assessment of
the Hestia study.18 However, despite these differences in patients'
characteristics, the rate of patients managed at home was not higher
with the Hestia strategy than with the sPESI strategy. This unexpected result emphasizes the relevance and importance of physicians' and
patients' related factors in the real-world applicability and effectiveness of the two triaging tools.
Importantly, the rate of adverse events in patients treated at home
in our study was low and similar between the two triaging strategies.
It compares well to that in recent studies on this topic, supporting
the external validity of our study.12,25,26 Notably, the most commonly
occurring complication was major uterine bleeding in women treated
with a direct oral anticoagulant.27
Nearly, a quarter of our patients had right ventricular dilatation as
assessed by echocardiography or computed tomography pulmonary
angiography. How the presence of right ventricular dilatation should
influence the decision to treat normotensive PE patients at home is
an ongoing debate.28 The HOME-PE study was not designed to solve
this issue and assessment of right ventricular function was not compulsory. However, none of the 90 patients, who had right ventricular

dilatation at presentation and were treated at home, returned to the
hospital because of haemodynamic deterioration or experienced a
PE recurrence or PE-related death. Similar results have been
reported in another study.29

Strengths and limitations of this study

Implications for policy and practice
Our findings add evidence to current guidelines supporting home
treatment with either the Hestia rule or the sPESI. The sPESI consists
of fewer and exclusively objective criteria but requires an additional
assessment of the suitability of home treatment. The Hestia rule
includes medical and social conditions that preclude home treatment.
Its applicability is better but certain criteria leave room for the physician's judgement. In our study, both strategies safely led to home
treatment in more than one-third of patients. Widespread implementation of either Hestia or sPESI triaging strategy could therefore result in considerable cost savings, as more than 90% of PE patients are
currently hospitalized in several European countries and in the
USA.30,31 One important feature is that all participating hospitals had
set up a specific patient pathway based on local experts, to organize
home treatment, with timely follow-up and clear instructions for discharged patients. This may have contributed to the low rate of complications. In our view, and in line with current guidelines1,2 and with
the organization in place in the countries that have a wide experience
in home treatment of PE patients,9,32,33 such an organization should
optimally be in place before home treatment is implemented.

HOME-PE is the largest trial of PE home treatment to date, providing
robust results with a narrow 95% CI on the rate of adverse events.
Several strengths reinforce the generalizability of its results. HOMEPE was performed in four European countries with different healthcare organization and in 26 hospitals with, for most of them, a very
low or low level of experience in home treatment of PE patients
prior to study initiation. Although we had a strict randomization process, the trial was designed and conducted in real-world clinical practice. Especially, the physician-in-charge had the possibility to overrule
the qualification issued from the triaging tool in each study arm and
could involve the patient's preference in the decision-making, as
would occur in daily practice.
Our study also has limitations. First, we chose a pragmatic trial design over an explanatory design, since the goal of HOME-PE was to
provide clinicians with robust evidence to safely triage PE patients for
home treatment directly transferable into their everyday clinical practice.24 Second, HOME-PE was not formally powered to compare the
rate of adverse events in the subgroups of patients treated at home,
but the very low rate of complications reinforces the validity of using
either triage tool. Third, participating hospitals had to set up a specific
patient pathway for home treatment that may be difficult to organize
in lack of local expert availability, especially in community hospitals.
Finally, as a double-blind study design was not feasible, physicians may
have incorporated some criteria of one rule when assessing patients
randomized to the other one. Nonetheless, the characteristics of
patients treated at home were different between the two study arms,
confirming that the physicians made different decisions in patients
assigned to the Hestia triaging strategy or to the sPESI triaging
strategy.
