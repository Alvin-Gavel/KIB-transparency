Aims

The morbidity and mortality rates of calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) remain high while treatment options are
limited. Here, we evaluated the role and therapeutic value of dual-specificity phosphatase 26 (DUSP26) in CAVD.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
Microarray profiling of human calcific aortic valves and normal controls demonstrated that DUSP26 was significantly up-regulated in calcific aortic valves. ApoE-/- mice fed a normal diet or a high cholesterol diet (HCD) were
and results

infected with adeno-associated virus serotype 2 carrying DUSP26 short-hairpin RNA to examine the effects of
DUSP26 silencing on aortic valve calcification. DUSP26 silencing ameliorated aortic valve calcification in HCDtreated ApoE-/- mice, as evidenced by reduced thickness and calcium deposition in the aortic valve leaflets,
improved echocardiographic parameters (decreased peak transvalvular jet velocity and mean transvalvular pressure
gradient, as well as increased aortic valve area), and decreased levels of osteogenic markers (Runx2, osterix, and
osteocalcin) in the aortic valves. These results were confirmed in osteogenic medium-induced human valvular interstitial cells. Immunoprecipitation, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, and functional assays revealed
that dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) interacted with DUSP26 to mediate the procalcific effects of DUSP26. High N6methyladenosine levels up-regulated DUSP26 in CAVD; in turn, DUSP26 activated DPP4 by antagonizing mouse
double minute 2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of DPP4, thereby promoting CAVD progression.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
DUSP26 promotes aortic valve calcification by inhibiting DPP4 degradation. Our findings identify a previously unrecognized mechanism of DPP4 up-regulation in CAVD, suggesting that DUSP26 silencing or inhibition is a viable
therapeutic strategy to impede CAVD progression.

Translational Perspective
Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is a prevalent disorder with high morbidity and mortality rates and limited treatment options.
Thus, there is an unmet medical need to identify novel therapeutic targets for CAVD. Our findings reveal a novel role of dual-specificity
phosphatase 26 (DUSP26) in CAVD, independent of its phosphatase function. DUSP26 up-regulation is mediated by N6-methyladenosine modification and promotes aortic valve calcification in vitro and in vivo. DUSP26 increases dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) protein stability by preventing mouse double minute 2-induced DPP4 ubiquitination and degradation. Hence, DUSP26 depletion may represent a
novel therapeutic strategy for CAVD.

Introduction
Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is burdened by high morbidity and mortality associated with aortic sclerosis and stenosis.1
Currently, there is no pharmacological treatment for CAVD;
interventions targeting CAVD risk factors, such as lipid-lowering
therapy, fail to suppress CAVD progression.2 Surgical and transcatheter aortic valve replacement remain the most effective treatment options; however, they often cause complications and

provide poor long-term outcomes. Therefore, research for identifying more suitable therapeutic options is ongoing. The phenotypic switching of human aortic valve interstitial cells (hVICs) to an
osteoblast-like phenotype is recognized as the fundamental hallmark of valvular calcification.3 Thus, effective strategies to prevent
the osteogenic differentiation of hVICs may provide novel therapeutic options for CAVD.

mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatases, are protein

High m6A levels up-regulated DUSP26 in CAVD; in turn, DUSP26 enhanced DPP4 expression by antagonizing MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of DPP4, thereby promoting CAVD progression.

DUSP26 induces aortic valve calcification

Methods
Detailed methods are described in the Supplementary material online.

Human studies and ethics
Human-calcified aortic valve leaflets were obtained from patients with
CAVD during aortic valve replacement. Control noncalcified aortic valves
were collected from the explanted hearts of patients who underwent
heart transplantation for dilated cardiomyopathy. Exclusion criteria
included bicuspid aortic valves (BAVs), valves with moderate-to-severe
aortic valve regurgitation, infective endocarditis, congenital valve disease,
and rheumatic aortic valvulopathy. The protocol for this study complied
with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Tongji Medical
College Institutional Review Board, Huazhong University of Science and
Technology. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients.

Animal studies and ethics
All animal experiments were approved by the Animal Care and Use
Committee of Tongji Medical College and complied with the European
Communities Council Directive 86/609/EEC and 2010/63/EU for the
protection of animals used for experimental purposes. Male ApoE-/C57BL/6 mice were used in this study as previously described.15 Adenoassociated virus subtype 2 carrying short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting
DUSP26 (AAV2-sh-DUSP26) and AAV2-scramble (AAV2-scr) was delivered into 4-week-old ApoE-/- mice through the tail vein 4 weeks prior to
diet treatment. ApoE-/- mice (8 weeks old) were randomly allocated into
the following four groups and observed for 24 weeks: mice fed a normal

.. diet (ND) and administered AAV2-sh-DUSP26 (n = 10); mice fed an ND
..
.. and administered AAV2-scr (n = 10); mice fed a 0.25% high cholesterol
.. diet (HCD; TD 88137, Harlan Teklad, Madison, WI, USA) and adminis..
.. tered AAV2-sh-DUSP26 (n = 10); and mice fed an HCD and adminis.. tered AAV2-scr (n = 10). HCD-fed animals were maintained on the diet
..
.. for 24 weeks to induce aortic valve calcification.15,19 Following final trans.. thoracic echocardiography and haemodynamic assessment, mice were
.. sacrificed, and aortic valves and blood were collected for histopathologic..
.. al examination.
..
..
..
.. Results
..
..
.. DUSP26 is up-regulated in human calcific
..
.. aortic valves due to m6A modification
.. To identify genes involved in CAVD, we analysed the gene expres..
.. sion profiles of three human CAVs and three normal aortic valves
..
.. (see Supplementary material online, Table S1 for the baseline charac.. teristics of patients). We identified 401 differentially expressed genes
..
.. in CAVs, with 215 up-regulated and 186 down-regulated genes (data.. set 1) (filtered by jfold change (FC)j >_ 2 and P < 0.05). The top 10 dif..
.. ferentially expressed genes were evaluated by hierarchical clustering
.. (Figure 1A and Supplementary material online, Table S2). To identify
..
.. genes with functional significance from the top 10 up-regulated genes,
.. we first verified their gene expression levels in 100 human aortic
..
.. valves (50 CAVs and 50 normal controls; see Supplementary material
..
.. online, Table S3 for patient characteristics and Supplementary mater.. ial online, Figure S1 for calcification staining). Eight out of 10 of these
..
.. genes were up-regulated in CAVs (Supplementary material online,
.. Figure S2A-J). Functional shRNA screening to identify calcification..
.. associated genes revealed that silencing of CBLN1, DUSP26, and
.. LRRTM1 down-regulated three osteogenic markers (Runx2, osterix,
..
.. and osteocalcin) in osteogenic medium-induced hVICs; DUSP26
.. silencing was the most prominent (Supplementary material online,
..
.. Figure S2K-M). Hence, we focused on DUSP26 in our subsequent
.. experiments. DUSP26 up-regulation in CAVs (Figure 1B) was con..
.. firmed by immunofluorescence staining (Figure 1C) and immunoblot..
.. ting (Figure 1D). Interestingly, the DUSP26 protein preferentially
.. accumulated on the aortic surface and not the ventricular surface of
..
.. the leaflets. This localization indicates a potential role for DUSP26 in
.. valvular calcification as calcification usually arises from the aortic side
..
.. of the valve leaflets.1
..
We have previously shown that methyltransferase-like 3
..
.. (METTL3)-mediated m6A modification accounts for the elevated ex.. pression of twist-related protein 1 (TWIST1) in CAVD.20 To assess
..
.. the relevance of m6A in DUSP26 up-regulation, we analysed
.. DUSP26 sequence and identified a consensus METTL3 motif
..
.. (AGACU) in the 30 -untranslated region (30 -UTR) of DUSP26 mRNA
..
.. adjacent to the stop codon (Figure 1E and F and Supplementary ma.. terial online, Figure S3). m6A dot blot analysis showed that the global
.. 6
.. m A level was increased in human CAVs (Supplementary material
.. online, Figure S4A). In addition, osteogenic stimulation increased the
..
.. global m6A level in primary hVICs, which was attenuated and aggra.. vated by METTL3 silencing and overexpression, respectively
..
.. (Figure 1G). Importantly, RNA immunoprecipitation following quanti.. tative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RIP-qRT-PCR) showed
..
. that METTL3 directly interacted with DUSP26 mRNA (Figure 1H)

tyrosine phosphatases that dephosphorylate threonine and tyrosine
residues.4 DUSPs have been implicated in atherosclerosis,5,6 which
has a similar aetiology to that of CAVD. Dual-specificity phosphatase
26 (DUSP26), a DUSP family member, regulates cell proliferation by
dephosphorylating fas-associated protein with death domain7 and
has been proposed as a transforming growth factor beta-activated
kinase 1 (TAK1)-targeted therapeutic option for nonalcoholic fatty
liver disease.8 Gomez-Banoy et al.9 reported that DUSP26 inhibition
alleviated type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, DUSP26 has been implicated
in p38 MAPK-dependent regulation of neonatal cardiomyocyte proliferation in the mouse heart.10 Nonetheless, the role of DUSP26 in
CAVD remains unknown.
Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4; also known as CD26) is a membrane-bound enzyme widely expressed in different organs.11 DPP4
has been proposed as a therapeutic target for cardiometabolic diseases, such as atherosclerosis,12 type 2 diabetes,13 and CAVD.14 We
have recently shown that DPP4 regulates osteogenic differentiation
in hVICs.15 Nevertheless, DPP4 has various biological functions, and
DPP4 inhibition may increase the risk of heart failure,16 bullous pemphigoid,17 and arthralgia.18 Therefore, a better understanding of the
role of DPP4 may lead to the development of effective therapies for
CAVD.
In this study, we conducted tissue microarrays and found that
DUSP26 was highly expressed in human calcific aortic valves (CAVs).
DUSP26 up-regulation was mediated by N6-methyladenosine (m6A)
modification in hVICs and was associated with CAVD progression
in vitro and in vivo. By binding to its C-terminal domain, DUSP26 inhibited mouse double minute 2 (MDM2)-induced DPP4 ubiquitination
and degradation in hVICs. Hence, DUSP26 depletion may represent
a novel therapeutic strategy for CAVD.

DUSP26 ablation ameliorates aortic
valve calcification in vivo
To investigate the role of DUSP26 in aortic valve calcification in vivo,
we silenced DUSP26 expression in ApoE-/- mice using AAV2-shDUSP26 (or AAV2-scr control) delivered via tail vein injection.23 The
efficiency of DUSP26 silencing in the aortic valves was validated
(Supplementary material online, Figure S5). After 24 weeks, the mice
in the HCD th AAV2-scr group showed significant increases in peak
transvalvular jet velocity (Figure 2A) and mean transvalvular pressure
gradient (Figure 2B) and a significant decrease in aortic valve area
(AVA; Figure 2C); DUSP26 knockdown partly restored these changes
(Figure 2A-C). However, there were no significant differences in left
ventricular/right ventricular diameters, left ventricular systolic/diastolic function, haemodynamic parameters, or arterial blood pressure
between the HCD groups (Supplementary Table 4). Left ventricular
global longitudinal strain (GLS) analysis showed that HCD slightly
decreased GLS; however, this change was not significant
(Supplementary Table 4). Insignificant trends towards higher GLS
were also observed in the HCDthAAV2-sh-DUSP26 group in comparison to the HCDthAAV2-scr group (Supplementary Table 4). We
also found no significant changes in mean pulmonary arterial pressure, right ventricle/(left ventricle th interventricular septum), crosssectional area of the right ventricle (Supplementary material online,
Figure S6A-C) and haemodynamic parameters (Supplementary
Table 5) between the four groups. These data suggest an insignificant
role for DUSP26 in pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular
morphology and function.

..
We then examined valve leaflet morphology, fibrosis, and calcifica..
.. tion in ApoE-/- mice. HCD promoted aortic valve calcification in
..
.. ApoE-/- mice as evidenced by increased aortic valve leaflet thickness
.. (Figure 2D) and collagen (Figure 2E) and calcium deposition (Figure 2F
..
.. and G). Strikingly, DUSP26 silencing partially normalized these
.. changes (Figure 2D-G) and reduced the levels of osteogenic markers
..
.. (Figure 2H). However, DUSP26 silencing failed to significantly modu..
.. late the levels of glucose, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein,
.. and triglycerides (Supplementary material online, Table 6). These
..
.. results suggest that DUSP26 silencing ameliorates aortic valve calcifi.. cation in ApoE-/- mice independently of metabolic regulation.

.. to DUSP26-mediated aortic valve calcification in ApoE-/- mice.
..
..
..
..
..
.. DUSP26 silencing ameliorates aortic

.. valve calcification in vitro
..
.. As the phenotypic transformation of hVICs into osteoblast-like cells
.. is a critical step in CAVD pathogenesis,15,19 we investigated whether
..
.. DUSP26 orchestrated hVIC osteogenic differentiation. We isolated
.. hVICs from human aortic valves from non-CAVD controls (see
..
.. Supplementary Table 7 for patient characteristics and Supplementary
..
.. material online, Figure S8 for the identification of primary hVICs).
.. Before osteogenic induction, the protein levels of osteogenic
..
.. markers and calcium deposition were undetectable in hVICs
.. (Supplementary material online, Figure S9). Thus, hVICs were main..
.. tained in a quiescent state before commencing the experiments, as
.. previously described.26 We exposed hVICs to osteogenic medium to
..
.. stimulate osteogenic differentiation;19 osteogenic induction was
..
.. accompanied by time-dependent increases in DUSP26 mRNA and
.. protein levels (Figure 3A and B), along with Runx2 up-regulation
..
.. (Figure 3B). Positive correlations between the mRNA levels of
.. DUSP26 and osteogenic markers were revealed (Runx2, r = 0.5236,
..
.. P = 0.0003; osterix, r = 0.6605, P = 0.0001; osteocalcin, r = 0.5397,
..
.. P = 0.0002; Supplementary material online, Figure S10).
..
Next, we investigated whether DUSP26 could reprogram hVICs

towards
an osteogenic phenotype. DUSP26 silencing negated the
..
.. osteogenic medium-induced increase in the levels of osteogenic
..
.. markers (Figure 3C), calcified nodule formation, and calcium depos.. ition (Figure 3D and Supplementary material online, Figure S11);
..
.. DUSP26 overexpression had the opposite effects (Figure 3E and F).
..
.. We also isolated hVICs from human aortic valve tissues from CAVD
.. patients (see Supplementary Table 7 for patient characteristics). We
..
.. compared the phenotype of hVICs from CAVD patients and non.. CAVD controls at baseline and found that only hVICs from CAVD
..
.. patients exhibited calcium deposition and expression of osteogenic

.. markers (Supplementary material online, Figure S12), indicating that
.. osteogenic changes in hVICs are characteristic features of CAVD
..
.. patients.14,27 Furthermore, the effects of DUSP26 manipulation in
.. hVICs from CAVD patients were similar to those in hVICs from non..
. CAVD controls (Figure 3).

and that METTL3 silencing significantly decreased m6A levels of
DUSP26 mRNA in hVICs (Supplementary material online, Figure
S4B). METTL3 silencing decreased while METTL3 overexpression
increased the luciferase activity of the wild-type DUSP26 30 -UTR reporter (Figure 1I and Supplementary material online, Figure S4C).
However, neither knockdown nor overexpression of METTL3
altered the luciferase activity of the mutated DUSP26 30 -UTR reporter (Figure 1I and Supplementary material online, Figure S4C). METTL3
depletion significantly reduced DUSP26 protein levels and its mRNA
half-life (Figure 1J and K). Conversely, METTL3 overexpression
increased DUSP26 protein levels and DUSP26 mRNA half-life (Figure
1L and M). These findings suggest that METTL3-mediated m6A modification accounts for the increased expression of DUSP26 in CAVD
by enhancing its mRNA stability.
METTL3 has been shown to promote the translation of its targets
in a YTH domain family 1 (YTHDF1)-mediated m6A-dependent manner.21,22 Therefore, we further explored the role of YTHDF1 in the
translation of m6A-methylated DUSP26 in hVICs. YTHDF1 depletion
reduced DUSP26 protein levels and DUSP26 mRNA half-life (Figure
1N and O), while YTHDF1 overexpression had the opposite effects
(Supplementary material online, Figure S4D and E). YTHDF1 directly
interacted with DUSP26 mRNA (Figure 1P); this interaction was
inhibited or strengthened by METTL3 silencing (Figure 1Q) or overexpression (Supplementary material online, Figure S4F), respectively.
Taken together, these data suggested that METTL3 facilitates the
translation of m6A-methylated DUSP26 mRNA in a YTHDF1-dependent manner.

DUSP26 interacts with DPP4 and
prevents its degradation in hVICs

DUSP26 inhibits MDM2-mediated DPP4
ubiquitination in hVICs
We identified a conserved MDM2-binding motif in DPP4 protein
(Figure 5A). To explore whether MDM2 functions as a novel E3 ligase
of DPP4, we conducted co-IP to assess the interaction between
DPP4 and MDM2. Ectopically expressed HA-DPP4 was coimmunoprecipitated by Myc-tagged MDM2 in hVICs (Figure 5B). The

interaction between endogenous DPP4 and MDM2 was confirmed
(Figure 5C). In addition, MDM2 silencing by two different shRNAs
increased the protein level but not the mRNA level of DPP4 in hVICs
(Figure 5D and Supplementary material online, Figure S15). Conversely,
MDM2 overexpression decreased the protein level of DPP4 in hVICs,
and this effect was inhibited by MG132 (Figure 5E). Furthermore,
MDM2 overexpression reduced the half-life of DPP4 (Figure 5F) and
increased DPP4 polyubiquitination in hVICs (Figure 5G). These data
suggest DPP4 as a bona fide substrate of MDM2.
To identify the region of DPP4 responsible for MDM2 binding, we
performed in vitro co-IP and found that the C-terminus of DPP4 interacted with MDM2 (Figure 5H). As the C-terminus of DPP4 interacted
also with DUSP26 (Figure 4H), we explored the ability of DUSP26 to
compete with MDM2 binding to DPP4 in hVICs. DUSP26 silencing in
hVICs augmented the interaction between MDM2 and DPP4
(Figure 5I). In contrast, DUSP26 overexpression blocked the binding
between MDM2 and DPP4 (Figure 5J). Moreover, DUSP26 knockdown decreased DPP4 protein levels; this effect was diminished upon
co-knockdown of DUSP26 and MDM2 in hVICs (Figure 5K). We also
found an inverse correlation between MDM2 and DUSP26 protein
levels (r = -0.5638, P = 0.0096; Supplementary material online, Figure
S14B). Likewise, a negative correlation was seen between MDM2 and
DPP4 protein levels in 20 human CAVs (r = -0.6569, P = 0.0017;
Supplementary material online, Figure S14C). These results suggest
that MDM2 functions as a novel E3 ligase of DPP4, and DUSP26 competes with MDM2 binding to the C-terminus of DPP4, increasing
DPP4 protein stability in hVICs.

DUSP26 exerts procalcific effects
through DPP4 up-regulation
Next, we performed a rescue experiment to confirm whether
DUSP26 functions through DPP4 up-regulation. The calcification alleviation effects of DUSP26 knockdown were reversed by DPP4 overexpression (Figure 6A and B). In contrast, the procalcific effects of
DUSP26 overexpression were prevented by DPP4 depletion (Figure
6C and D), indicating that DUSP26 promotes osteogenic differentiation by up-regulating DPP4 in hVICs.

DPP4 inhibition alleviates aortic valve
calcification in vivo
Sitagliptin, a selective DPP4 inhibitor, has been shown to reduce calcification in eNOS-/- mice.14 Here, we orally administered HCD-fed
ApoE-/- mice with vehicle or sitagliptin for 24 weeks. Sitagliptin ameliorated aortic valve calcification in HCD-fed ApoE-/- mice, as evidenced by improved echocardiographic parameters (decreased peak
transvalvular jet velocity and mean transvalvular pressure gradient
and increased AVA), reduced collagen and calcium deposition, and
decreased levels of osteogenic markers in the aortic valve leaflets
(Supplementary material online, Figure S16).

DUSP26 expression is associated with
CAVD severity
To assess the clinical relevance of our findings, we analysed the correlation between DUSP26 levels and markers of subclinical atherosclerosis and CAVD severity in 50 human CAVs (validation cohort).
The relationship between DUSP26 expression levels and CAVD

HVIC extracts were immunoprecipitated with immunoglobulin G
(IgG) or anti-DUSP26 antibody (Figure 4A) for mass spectrometry
analysis. We identified DPP4 as a potential binding partner of
DUSP26 in hVICs (Figure 4B). To verify this interaction, we co-transfected hVICs with HA-tagged DPP4 and Flag-tagged DUSP26
(Figure 4C). Coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) analysis showed that exogenously overexpressed Flag-DUSP26 could bind HA-DPP4 in
hVICs (Figure 4C). The interaction between endogenous DUSP26
and DPP4 was also verified in hVICs (Figure 4D). As DUSP26 acts as a
protein phosphatase,28 we explored whether its enzymatic activity
was required for its interaction with DPP4. Treatment with the
DUSP26 inhibitor F1063-096729 did not affect the interaction between DUSP26 and DPP4 in hVICs (Figure 4E). Similarly, the DUSP26
phosphatase-dead mutant (C152S) preserved its ability to bind DPP4
(Figure 4F). Thus, DUSP26 interacts with DPP4 independently of its
phosphatase activity. Furthermore, we constructed DPP4-N-terminal
(amino acids 1-324) and DPP4-C-terminal (amino acids 325-766)
plasmids to determine which region of DPP4 interacted with
DUSP26 (Figure 4G). DUSP26, full-length Flag-DPP4, N-terminal FlagDPP4, and C-terminal Flag-DPP4 were translated in vitro as previously
reported.30 IP analyses revealed that the C-terminus of DPP4 interacted with DUSP26 (Figure 4H), suggesting that DUSP26 interacts
with DPP4 by binding to the C-terminus of DPP4.
We also investigated the role of DUSP26 in DPP4 expression in
hVICs. Intriguingly, DUSP26 knockdown decreased the protein level
but not the mRNA level of DPP4 in hVICs (Figure 4I and
Supplementary material online, Figure S13A). Conversely, DUSP26
overexpression increased the DPP4 protein level but not the mRNA
level (Figure 4J and Supplementary material online, Figure S13B).
Overexpression of phosphatase-dead mutant (C152S) DUSP26 also
increased the protein level of DPP4 in hVICs (Supplementary material online, Figure S13C), suggesting that DUSP26 regulates DPP4 expression at the posttranslational level independent of its phosphatase
activity. Poly-ubiquitination is a posttranscriptional modification promoting protein degradation via the 26S proteasome.31 DUSP26
silencing-induced DPP4 down-regulation was attenuated by the 26S
proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Figure 4K). Moreover, DUSP26 knockdown shortened the half-life of DPP4 and increased the polyubiquitination of DPP4 in hVICs (Figure 4L and M). Likewise, DUSP26
overexpression failed to further increase DPP4 levels upon MG132
treatment (Supplementary material online, Figure S13D). Further
more, DUSP26 overexpression prolonged the half-life of DPP4 and
reduced the polyubiquitination of DPP4 in hVICs (Supplementary
material online, Figure S13E and F). DUSP26 levels were correlated
with DPP4 levels in human CAVD samples (r = 0.5096, P = 0.0217;
Supplementary material online, Figure S14A).

therefore, our results may only be applied to tricuspid CAVD.
Whether DUSP26 also plays a role in bicuspid CAVD requires further investigation. DUSP26 has been reported to act as a protein
phosphatase.28 In this study, we demonstrated a novel role of
DUSP26, independent of its phosphatase function, in which up-regulated DUSP26 displaces MDM2 from DPP4 in a manner similar to
deubiquitination.42 However, DUSP26 is not a known deubiquitinating enzyme. Thus, this novel function of DUSP26 may provide a new
direction for future studies. Moreover, we identified a positive correlation between DUSP26 levels and CAVD severity in CAVD patients;
however, the correlation between DUSP26 expression and atherosclerosis severity was not significant. These data may reflect the different pathogenesis between CAVD and atherosclerosis and the
specific role of DUSP26 in pro-calcification.
The key role of DPP4 as a crucial modulator in CAVD progression
has gained wide acceptance.14,15,43 However, the feasibility and safety
of DPP4 inhibitors for treating CAVD require validation in preclinical
and clinical studies. Indeed, saxagliptin, a DPP4 inhibitor, has been
proposed to contribute to a higher risk of hospitalization due to heart
failure.16,44 Vildagliptin and linagliptin are associated with an increased
risk of bullous pemphigoid.17 Importantly, the US Food and Drug
Administration has warned that DPP4 inhibitors, including sitagliptin,
saxagliptin, linagliptin, and alogliptin, may cause severe and persistent
arthralgia.18 Hence, we identified a new endogenous regulatory network independent of DPP4 inhibitors in CAVD in which DUSP26
positively regulated DPP4 by antagonizing the MDM2-mediated
DPP4 ubiquitination and degradation. Therefore, our findings provide
new mechanistic insights into how DPP4 modulates CAVD progression in an endogenous regulatory manner, which may circumvent the
potential adverse effects of DPP4 inhibitors.
Ubiquitination is a crucial posttranslational modification determining protein fate by tagging substrates for proteasomal degradation.45
E3 ubiquitin ligases, the key enzymes of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, play an important role in pathophysiological processes related
to cardiovascular diseases.46,47 We showed for the first time that
MDM2, a key E3 ubiquitin ligase, binds to DPP4, thereby directly catalyzing its ubiquitination and degradation in CAVD. Consistent with
these findings, MDM2 promotes the degradation of other proteins,
including histone deacetylase 1 protein,48 TP53,49 and angiotensinconverting enzyme 2.50 This is not surprising since ubiquitination is
ubiquitous, while E3 ubiquitin ligases are relatively limited. Thus,
whether MDM2 ubiquitinates other key regulatory proteins to regulate CAVD progression needs further exploration. Moreover, it has
been extensively reported that some substrates, such as Runx2,
could be degraded by multiple E3 ubiquitin ligases.51-53 Hence, further studies are required to investigate whether other E3 ubiquitin
ligases target DPP4 for ubiquitin-mediated degradation and hence
regulate CAVD progression.
This study has several limitations. First, our microarray-based approach might have introduced selection bias because the initial selection of the potential candidates involved in CAVD was based on a
relatively small sample size. Second, the cell-type transcriptome atlas
of human aortic valves reveals cell heterogeneity involved in
CAVD.54 Thus, the application of microarray analysis to study the
bulk transcriptome could mask the low-abundance changes at the
transcriptome level. Third, we did not take into account sex-based
differences. To fully address this issue, we should include both males

CAVD is a multifactorial disease with high spatiotemporal heterogeneity,32 and its pathogenesis involves genetic factors, lipoprotein deposition, inflammation, and osteogenic transition of cardiac valve
interstitial cells.33 Although a few risk factors have been identified,
the molecular mechanisms causing aortic valve calcification are
poorly understood. Currently, there are no effective interventions
that prevent CAVD progression.34 This is the first study to show that
DUSP26 promotes aortic valve calcification by up-regulating DPP4.
Specifically, we found that increased DUSP26 levels in human aortic
valves were associated with valve calcification. DUSP26 up-regulation
resulted from METTL3-mediated translation of m6A-methylated
DUSP26 mRNA in a YTHDF1-dependent manner. Notably, DUSP26
silencing reduced aortic valve calcification in vitro and in vivo. We also
identified MDM2 as an E3 ligase ubiquitylating DPP4, while DUSP26
competed with MDM2 for binding to the C-terminus of DPP4,
increasing DPP4 protein stability. Moreover, we found that DUSP26
exerted procalcific effects by up-regulating DPP4. These findings pinpoint a previously unidentified regulatory DUSP26-DPP4 axis contributing to CAVD.
Mounting evidence suggests that METTL3-mediated m6A modification plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases.35,36 Hence, we demonstrated that METTL3 facilitated the
translation of m6A-methylated DUSP26 mRNA through a YTHDF1dependent pathway, consistent with previous findings.22,37 We have
previously demonstrated that METTL3-mediated m6A modification
promotes CAVD progression by regulating TWIST1.20 In fact, m6A is
added to mRNA by a multisubunit writer complex containing
METTL3, METTL14, Wilms' tumour-1-associated protein, RNAbinding motif protein 15/15B, Cbl proto-oncogene-like protein 1,
and Zinc finger CCCH-type containing 13. There are many types of
m6A readers, such as YTHDF1-3, YTH domain-containing proteins,
eukaryotic initiation factor 3, and fragile X mental retardation protein.38 Thus, whether additional m6A writers and readers play distinct
roles in the regulation of DUSP26 expression requires further
investigation.
Increasing evidence suggests that DUSP26 regulates type 2 diabetes,9 nonalcoholic fatty liver disease,8 and chamber-specific growth
in the heart.10 However, its role in CAVD remained uncharacterized.
Here, we demonstrated for the first time that DUSP26 was highly
expressed in human CAVs and promoted aortic valve calcification
in vitro and in vivo. Patients with severe calcific aortic stenosis develop
left ventricular obstruction, which gradually progresses to cardiac
hypertrophy and heart failure.39 In our mouse model, we did not observe any significant changes in the size and function of the heart
chamber, possibly because of insufficient hemodynamic stress and
the short follow-up period. In a recent study, DUSP26 was found to
protect against pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy.40
This result calls for caution when evaluating the effects of DUSP26
silencing on CAVD-associated cardiac hypertrophy. In our in vivo
study, we observed variability between the animals and an overlap
between groups. This variability may have resulted from various confounding factors, such as interindividual variability for HCD consumption in inbred mice. The mechanisms underlying BAVs and tricuspid
aortic valves differ.41 We used only tricuspid aortic valves and an
HCD-fed ApoE-/- mice rather than BAVs and a BAV mouse model;

might have concealed the factors associated with the development of
aortic valve stenosis. There are also limitations of the HCD-fed
ApoE-/- mouse model in addition to the extreme hypercholesterolaemia that may not faithfully represent the full progression of human
CAVD. The long follow-up of these mice may increase the number
of confounding factors (such as sickness, ageing, and even death of
mice) affecting the outcome of the in vivo findings. At present, there
are several commonly used models with obvious advantages; these
include NOS3-/-/Notch1th/-,55 USP9Xfl/Y/Creth,56 and klotho-deficient
mice.57 Further research is required to determine whether DUSP26
inhibition can ameliorate aortic valve calcification in these animal
models. In addition, we did not conduct in vivo studies using DUSP26
gene-modified mice. Although AAV2-mediated gene silencing is effective for conducting loss-of-function studies, data obtained using
DUSP26-knockout mice or a murine model harbouring a cell-type
specific deletion of DUSP26 in valve interstitial cells would be more
persuasive. Finally, the follow-up duration in our study was relatively
short and was insufficient to demonstrate the persistent effect originating from DUSP26 silencing on aortic valve calcification. A longer
follow-up study would exclude the events of aortic valve restenosis
and verify the long-term effects of DUSP26 silencing on cardiac
remodelling.
In conclusion, we showed that DUSP26 was significantly upregulated in CAVD due to enhanced METTL3-mediated translation of m6A-methylated DUSP26 mRNA in a YTHDF1-dependent
manner. DUSP26 depletion reduced aortic valve calcification both
in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, DUSP26 promoted the osteogenic differentiation of hVICs in aortic valve calcification by stabilizing DPP4. While MDM2 acted as a novel E3 ligase of DPP4,
DUSP26 competed with MDM2 for binding to the C-terminus of
DPP4 to increase its protein stability in hVICs (Graphical Abstract).
Therefore, our study provides novel insights into the molecular
mechanism regulating DPP4 in the pathogenesis of CAVD and
highlights the potential translation of DUSP26-targeted treatment
for CAVD in clinical settings.
