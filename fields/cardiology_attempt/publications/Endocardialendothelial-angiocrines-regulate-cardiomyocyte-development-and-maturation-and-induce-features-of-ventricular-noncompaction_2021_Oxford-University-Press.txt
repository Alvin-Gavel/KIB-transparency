Aims

Non-compaction cardiomyopathy is a devastating genetic disease caused by insufficient consolidation of ventricular
wall muscle that can result in inadequate cardiac performance. Despite being the third most common cardiomyopathy, the mechanisms underlying the disease, including the cell types involved, are poorly understood. We
have previously shown that endothelial cell-specific deletion of the chromatin remodeller gene Ino80 results in
defective coronary vessel development that leads to ventricular non-compaction in embryonic mouse hearts. We
aimed to identify candidate angiocrines expressed by endocardial and endothelial cells (ECs) in wildtype and LVNC
conditions in Tie2Cre;Ino80fl/fl transgenic embryonic mouse hearts, and test the effect of these candidates on cardiomyocyte proliferation and maturation.

results
We observed a pathological endocardial cell population in the non-compacted hearts and identified multiple dysre-

gulated angiocrine factors that dramatically affected cardiomyocyte behaviour. We identified Col15a1 as a coronary
vessel-secreted angiocrine factor, downregulated by Ino80-deficiency, that functioned to promote cardiomyocyte
proliferation. Furthermore, mutant endocardial and endothelial cells up-regulated expression of secreted factors,
such as Tgfbi, Igfbp3, Isg15, and Adm, which decreased cardiomyocyte proliferation and increased maturation.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusions
These findings support a model where coronary endothelial cells normally promote myocardial compaction

through secreted factors, but that endocardial and endothelial cells can secrete factors that contribute to non-compaction under pathological conditions.

Introduction
Left ventricular non-compaction (LVNC) is a rare but potentially
devastating disease, in which cardiac systolic function is compromised
due to incomplete compaction of the ventricular wall.1 Left ventricular non-compaction represents the third most prevalent form of congenital cardiomyopathy in the USA, manifesting in a myriad of
cardiovascular complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and
thromboembolism.2 Like many congenital cardiomyopathies, the
genetic basis of LVNC is highly complex and remains elusive.
Genome-wide association studies have identified common gene
mutations and molecular pathways related to sarcomere and sarcolemma function (e.g. MYH7, MYBPC3, TPM1, and TNNT2) in LVNC
patients,3,4 though such identified mutations are also found in dilated
or hypertrophic cardiomyopathies and are not unique to LVNC.
Due to the limited understanding of the precise aetiology of the disease, there currently exists no therapeutic solutions that reverse the
ventricular non-compaction phenotype.2,5 Animal models of ventricular non-compaction to date have suggested that the pathology arises
during embryonic development due to insufficient proliferation and
premature maturation of cardiomyocytes from dysregulation of developmental signalling pathways such as transforming growth factorbeta (TGF-b) and Notch signalling.1,6 Interestingly, a number of recent
studies have found that the LVNC phenotype not only manifests in
the myocardium but it is also highly correlated with improper

endocardial function and/or development of the coronary endothelium.7-10 For instance, endocardial/endothelial-specific deletion of
Fkbp1a leads to myocardial non-compaction via up-regulation of
endocardial Notch1 signalling, underlining the role of myocardium-toendocardium paracrine signalling in controlling ventricular wall formation.8 Additionally, dysregulation of Notch signalling in endocardial
cells (ECs)9,11 or presence of a single-nucleotide variant in MKL2 in
vascular cells were shown to generate or contribute to LVNC, respectively.10,12 These observations suggest the possibility that LVNC
can arise from defects in cardiac endocardium and endothelium.
We previously reported that endothelial-specific deletion of the
chromatin remodeller Ino80 also results in an LVNC phenotype,
where impaired coronary vessel angiogenesis coincided with
non-compaction of the ventricular wall.7 In contrast, myocardial development and compaction were unaffected when Ino80 was deleted
specifically in cardiomyocytes or in epicardial-derived stromal cells. In
the Tie2Cre;Ino80fl/fl embryonic hearts exhibiting an LVNC phenotype, we observed that coronary vessel sprouting was compromised,
which was coincident with increased E2F-mediated gene transcription and proliferation in endocardial and ECs.7 We consequently hypothesize that when coronary angiogenesis cannot occur properly, it
cannot provide paracrine or angiocrine factors that promote myocardial compaction whereas the remaining endocardium secretes factors that stimulate maturation and inhibit cardiomyocyte
proliferation, leading to non-compaction of the myocardial wall.

LVNC phenotype

Human heart

4266
Here, we use single-cell RNA-sequencing in Tie2Cre;Ino80fl/fl and
wild-type counterpart embryonic hearts to identify candidate angiocrines expressed by endocardial and ECs during normal development
and in LVNC conditions. We also assess the modulatory role of the
identified secreted factors on cardiomyocyte proliferation and maturation in mouse heart development and in human-induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cardiomyocyte culture (Graphical
abstract).

Mouse lines
The laboratory animal care programme at Stanford University is accredited by the Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of
Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC Int'l). Experiments
were conducted accordingly with NIH and Stanford University policies
governing animal use and welfare. The mouse strains used in this study
were: wild-type (CD1 and FVB, Charles River Laboratories), Tie2Cre
(The Jackson Laboratories Stock number 004128), B6.CgTg(Tekcre)12Flv/J, Nfatc1Cre, and Ino80flox. For experiments, hemizygous Cre
Ino80flox/th male mice were crossed with Ino80fl/fl females. Transgenic
mice were on mixed backgrounds and ages (embryonic and adult) are
indicated with each experiment. Both male and female embryos were
included in analyses as we did not genotype for gender. When using the
AplnCreER to excise the Vegfr2 and Ino80, tamoxifen (4-OHT, H6278
Sigma) was dissolved in corn oil at a concentration of 20 mg/mL and
injected into pregnant females by oral gavage at E12.5 and E13.5.

Embryonic heart explant culture
Whole ventricles were dissected from E12.5 mouse embryos. Samples
were rinsed with cold Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) to remove blood
cells and placed in 1:200 Matrigel (BD Biosciences) with EGM-2 MV
media (Lonza, CC-4147, Basel, Switzerland) in 24-well plates (Costar,
3524) or cell culture inserts (MilliporeSigma, PI8P01250, Burlington, MA,
USA). Explants were cultured in 5% O2, 5% CO2 at 37 C for 36 h before
samples were fixed with 4% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS for 15 min.
After fixation, explants were washed three times with 0.5% PBT (PBS th
0.5% Tween 20) and immunofluorescence staining was performed directly within the 24-well culture plates. Explants were incubated with primary
antibodies in 0.5% PBT overnight at 4 C. Explants were washed with
0.5% PBT six times for 6 h and then incubated with corresponding secondary antibodies in 0.5% PBT overnight at 4 C. The day after, explants
were washed three times and nuclei were counter-stained with 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). After three washes in PBS, explants were
imaged using an inverted Zeiss LSM-700 confocal microscope. Captured
images were digitally processed using ImageJ (NIH) and Photoshop
(Adobe Systems, Mountain View, CA, USA). Small-molecule inhibition
was performed by the addition of 20 mM axitinib (Selleckchem, s1005,
Houston, TX, USA) dissolved in Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) directly to
culture media after 1-day culture. An equal concentration of DMSO was
added to the control media.

Human-induced pluripotent stem
cell-derived cardiomyocyte culture
Human iPSCs from an LVNC patient and a healthy member were
obtained from the Stanford Cardiovascular Institute iPSC Biobank.
Induced pluripotent stem cells were cultured in E8 media (Gibco) for
maintenance of pluripotency state. At 95% confluency, iPSCs were subjected to chemically defined cardiomyocyte differentiation protocol as

previously described.6 In brief, iPSCs were treated with 6 mM CHIR99021
(Selleckchem) in RPMIthB27 without insulin (Gibco) from Day 0 to 2.
Media was changed to RPMIthB27 without insulin from Day 2 to 3, then
the cells were treated with 5 mM IWR (Selleckchem) in RPMIthB27 without insulin from Day 3 to 5. Media was then changed to RPMIthB27 without insulin from Day 5 to 7. Robust beating of cardiomyocytes was
observed starting at Day 8 of differentiation. From Day 7 and forward,
iPSC-CMs were cultured in RPMIthB27 with insulin. Glucose starvation
from Day 11 to 13 was used to eliminate non-cardiomyocyte cells. At
Day 15, iPSC-CMs were transferred to Matrigel-coated chamber slides
or 24-well plates at a sparse cell density and cultured at 5% O2, 5% CO2
at 37 C for 2 days. Preparation for immunostaining was performed as
described above.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using Prism (GraphPad). Data are
represented as mean +/- SD. For animal knockout studies, no statistical
methods were used to predetermine sample size; sample size was determined based on mouse genetics. Crosses were performed until a minimum of 3-10 experimental animals (i.e. mutants) from multiple litters
were obtained. No randomization or blinding was performed for mouse
crosses, but all quantifications were counted by a researcher blinded to
genotype or treatment. Litter mate controls were always used for analysing experimental animals. Unpaired t-test (two-tailed) was performed to
assess statistical significance between two sample groups. A P < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant. Data from all experiments were
included in the analyses presented. No experiments were omitted based
on experimental outcomes, except for technical failures. Technical failures were rare, but always involved defective immunostaining, i.e. a complete absence of signal, and was due to expiring reagents. Power
calculations for each experiment were performed to ensure that the
numbers used have the power of 80% or greater to detect significant effect sizes (a = 0.05). When experiments did not reach this threshold,
experiments were repeated to include the appropriate n.

Results
Altered endocardial and cardiomyocyte
transcriptomes in Ino80 mutant hearts
with left ventricular non-compaction
To begin understanding how defective endothelial/endocardial cells
may be involved in non-compaction of neighbouring myocardium, we
performed scRNA-seq on dissected ventricles from Tie2Cre;Ino80fl/th
and Tie2Cre;Ino80fl/fl hearts, the latter of which exhibits ventricular
non-compaction phenotype (Figure 1A). We collected individual ventricular cells from embryonic day E15.5 hearts and performed droplet-based scRNA-seq using 10 Genomics Chromium platform. 518
Tie2Cre;Ino80fl/th and 576 Tie2Cre;Ino80fl/fl heart cells were used for
downstream analysis (Supplementary material online, Figure S1).
Unsupervised graph-based clustering identified nine expected cell
populations (Figure 1B, Supplementary material online, Figure S2),
which were annotated based on expression of known markers and
included endocardial cells (Npr3th), coronary vessel ECs (Cldn5th,
Fabp4th), smooth muscle cells/pericytes (Pdgfrbth), epicardium
(Apelath), three fibroblast clusters (Tcf21th, Col1a1th, Vcanth), and
two ventricular cardiomyocyte clusters (Tnni1th, Ttnth). All aforementioned cell types were observed in ventricular tissue of both genotypes (Figure 1C).

We next sub-clustered the endocardial and coronary endothelial populations to specifically investigate the differences between
control and Ino80 mutant vascular cells. Sub-clustering identified
four clusters within this population-three were comprised of
endocardial cells and one contained coronary endothelium (Figure
1D). One of the three endocardial clusters (Endo 3) contained
only Ino80-deficient cells and no control cells (Figure 1D, lower

high expression of proliferation genes, such as Top2a and Cdk1,
which are very low in normal endocardium at this stage of development (Figure 1E and F, Supplementary material online, Table S1).
Consistent with previous analyses from E12.5,7 in vivo EdU-labelling and tissue sectioning revealed that these ectopically cycling
endocardial cells primarily localized to non-compacted

myocardium at E15.5 (Figure 1G and H). Thus, this mouse model of
ventricular non-compaction is coincident with the emergence of
mutant-specific proliferative endocardial cells embedded within
non-compacted myocardium.
Since the phenotype following endothelial/endocardial Ino80 deletion is manifested in the myocardium, we next sub-clustered
cardiomyocytes to observe transcriptional changes associated with
non-compaction. Following sub-clustering, we observed three prominent cardiomyocyte subtypes, all of which contained cells from control and mutant hearts (Figure 2A). We first expected that the
different clusters would represent compact and trabecular myocardium. However, known compact and trabecular marker genes did

not distinguish the clusters. Instead, gene expression patterns indicated they were separated by maturity level and cell cycle.
Specifically, cardiomyocyte cluster 1 (CM1) was defined by mature
myocardial markers such as Ttn,13 Myh7,14 and mt-Co1,15 and CM2
was defined by higher expression of markers found in immature myocardium in other studies such as Tnni116 (Figure 2B and C). CM3 was
composed of cycling cells that also had lower expression of many of
the CM2 genes (Figure 2B and C).
Genes that were differentially expressed between CMs from control and Ino80-deficient hearts were calculated (all CMs from each
genotype were combined to increase statistical power). Thirty-nine
genes were down-regulated in Ino80-deficient hearts and 13 were

up-regulated (Figure 2D). Gene set enrichment analysis to probe hallmark gene sets identified glycolysis, hypoxia, and fatty acid metabolism as being increased in mutants and gene classified as involved in
development of skeletal muscle (myogenesis) to be down
(Supplementary material online, Table S2). Specific genes in this pathway are highlighted in Figure 2D and E. Of the differentially expressed
genes, Nppa was validated using in situ hybridization (Figure 2F).
Although one limitation of these data is the low number of cells, we
concluded that gene expression analysis indicates that cardiomyocyte
metabolic state and development is dysregulated.

Left ventricular non-compactionassociated genes are expressed in
multiple cardiac cell types
Our observations of Tie2Cre;Ino80fl/fl embryonic hearts indicate that
primary defects in vascular cells can cause ventricular non-compaction
in mice. To ascertain whether this is also possible in humans, we
assessed in E15.5 mouse ventricles the expression of genes whose variants have been found in LVNC patients. We found that approximately
one-third of the human LVNC-associated genes were expressed in
embryonic mouse cardiomyocytes (Figure 3A). Interestingly, about half
were specific to the more immature cluster, CM1, while the others

were more prominently expressed in the more mature cluster, CM2.
Another third was not highly expressed in cardiomyocytes, but instead
found in various stromal cell types, including endocardial cells, coronary vessel ECs, mural cells, and fibroblasts (Figure 3A).
To investigate the relevance of these findings to human development, we analysed single-cell RNA-sequencing of a 22-week-old
human foetal heart tissue. Expression patterns of LVNC genes in
foetal human cardiac cells were similar to those observed in mice
(Figure 3A and B). Furthermore, analysis of an independently generated adult human heart scRNA-seq dataset17 revealed that the
same set of LVNC-associated genes to be expressed in both cardiomyocytes and stromal cells (Figure 3C). A number of LVNC-associated genes expressed in foetal hearts, particularly those specific
to cardiomyocytes, maintained their expression in the adult heart
(Figure 3C). Finally, we investigated whether the genes associated
with LVNC have significant expression level differences in Ino80
mutant mice. Among these, seven genes were differentially
expressed in at least one cell type in our model of LVNC (Figure
3D). These data indicate the possibility that LVNC-associated
genes are derived from cells other than cardiomyocytes in humans
and that they may be important for cardiac homeostasis and function in the adult.

Endocardial/endothelial angiocrines regulate cardiomyocyte development

Col15a1 is expressed in coronary ECs
and stimulates cardiomyocyte
proliferation

Defective endocardium expresses
secreted factors that inhibit
cardiomyocyte proliferation and
stimulate maturation
As we found a mutant-specific endocardial cell cluster within the
non-compacted myocardium, we hypothesized that these cells may

secrete factors that affect neighbouring cardiomyocytes during compaction. We identified Tgfbi, Igfbp3, Isg15, and Adm (Figure 5A,
Supplementary material online, Figure S4 and Table S3) to be significantly up-regulated in Ino80 mutant endocardial and ECs, which encode secreted proteins. The increase in expression of these genes
was not specific to the Endo 3 cluster, but also occurred in other
endocardial clusters and coronary endothelium (Figure 5A), and, in
the case of Igfbp3, the epicardium (Supplementary material online,
Figure S4). We were particularly intrigued by the gene Tgfbi, or TGF-b
induced, as we have previously shown that human LVNC iPSC-CMs
exhibit dysregulated TGF-b signalling.6
We next validated the up-regulation of the four genes using in
situ hybridization. Tgfbi localization in Tie2Cre;Ino80fl/th and
Tie2Cre;Ino80fl/fl hearts at E15.5 revealed that, while its expression
was similar in the lung, mutant endocardial cells within non-compacted myocardium (i.e. Nppath) had increased mRNA levels (Figure
5B). Tie2Cre;Ino80fl/th and Tie2Cre;Ino80fl/fl hearts both express Tgfbi at
E12.5 when the ventricular wall is mostly trabeculae, with qualitatively greater expression in mutants (Figure 5C). As the majority of the
endocardial cells in the Tie2Cre;Ino80fl/th hearts down-regulated Tgfbi
by E13.5, the mutant endocardial cells maintained the high expression
of Tgfbi (Figure 5C). A time course of another gene increased in mutant endocardium, Igfbp3, showed the different pattern that there is
little endocardial expression in either genotype at E12.5, but its expression increased in mutants at later time points (Figure 5D). We
also confirmed that the expression of Isg15 and Adm was increased in
mutant ventricles (Supplementary material online, Figure S5). Thus,
these genes constitute a list of secreted factors whose expression is
positively correlated with ventricular non-compaction in mice.
We next aimed to address whether these gene expression
changes were a direct consequence of Ino80 deletion or perhaps a
tissue level response to impaired coronary angiogenesis and/or ventricular non-compaction (e.g. hypoxia). We cross-referenced the
scRNA-seq gene list with bulk RNA-seq data from cultured cells and
earlier staged Tie2Cre;Ino80fl/fl hearts (E13.5 and E14.5) that are not
yet as severely impacted.7 This included bulk RNA-seq performed on
cultured human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs) that were transfected
with either control or Ino80-specific siRNA and whole E13.5 and
E14.5 mutant hearts.7 Tgfbi and Isg15 were increased in both Ino80
knockdown human umbilical vein ECs and mutant hearts. However,
Igfbp3 and Adm were not changed or decreased in both experiments
(Figure 6A). These observations support the idea that Isg15 and Tgfbi
might be directly regulated by Ino80 while Igfbp3 and Adm up-regulation could be a consequence of hypoxia, which is consistent with
their known function of being hypoxia-inducible genes.21-23
We next tested the hypothesis that the secreted factors up-regulated in Ino80-deficient endocardial and coronary ECs inhibit compaction using both mouse and human cardiomyocytes. As above, we
utilized ex vivo assays of cardiomyocyte behaviour. In addition to
decreased cardiomyocyte proliferation,7 non-compaction is associated with decreased cardiomyocyte packing (Supplementary material
online, Figure S6) and premature sarcomere maturation as indicated
by increased striation development.7,24,25 For the mouse ex vivo and
human in vitro cardiomyocyte experiments, two general treatments
were given, either one of the identified factors individually (Tgfbi,
Igfbp3, Isg15, or Adm) or a cocktail of all factors together (4 factors
or '4F').

Our previous study showed that ECs stimulate cardiomyocyte proliferation, a behaviour critical for ventricular compaction, independent of
blood flow, and in an Ino80-dependent manner.7 We hypothesized
that this activity was mediated through a factor specifically secreted by
coronary ECs that was decreased in Ino80 mutants.7 We therefore
analysed our scRNA-seq data to first identify genes for secreted proteins (defined by Uniprot) that were expressed in coronary ECs and
not in the endocardium, which resulted in 15 potential candidates. In
particular, we found Col15a1 to be significantly down-regulated in
Ino80-deficient coronary ECs (Supplementary material online, Table
S3). Col15a1 was normally expressed in coronary ECs, smooth muscle
cells, and fibroblasts in mouse hearts and in coronary ECs and fibroblasts in human hearts (Figure 4A), but it was only significantly
decreased in Ino80-deficient coronary ECs (Figure 4A-C) as validated
by in situ hybridization on E15.5 hearts (Figure 4D). These data indicate
that endothelial deletion of Ino80 impairs expression of Col15a1 in coronary vessels, which may play a role in ventricular non-compaction.
We next assessed the effect of recombinant Col15a1 on cardiomyocyte proliferation by culturing explanted mouse embryonic heart
tissue. Explanted E12.5 mouse heart ventricles were cultured on a
dish for 1 day, then treated with recombinant proteins or a vehicle
control for 36 h prior to fixation and immunostaining7 (Figure 4E).
Proliferation was assessed by either phospho-H3 or EdU immuno
staining, and cardiomyocyte nuclei were identified by nuclear localization of Prox17,18 (Supplementary material online, Figure S3).
Exogenous treatment of Col15a1 increased proliferation of wild-type
mouse cardiomyocytes within explant cultures observed from phospho-H3 localization (Figure 4F) and EdU incorporation (Figure 4G),
which reached proliferative levels similar to that induced by Nrg119
(Figure 4F). Col15a1 also partially rescued the reduced proliferative
rate we previously found to be characteristic of ventricles from
Tie2Cre;Ino80fl/fl mice (Figure 4H) and heart explants exposed to the
vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibitor
s1005, which inhibits coronary EC growth7 (Figure 4I).
Previously, we have shown that iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes
(iPSC-CMs) from LVNC patients exhibit reduced proliferative
capacity.6,20 To determine whether Col15a1 also stimulates cardiomyocyte proliferation in human cardiomyocytes, we treated
LVNC iPSC-CMs with exogenous Col15a1 and observed Col15a1
increased proliferation of LVNC iPSC-CMs to levels more similar
to that of iPSC-CMs from a healthy family member (Figure 4J).
Taken together, our data suggest coronary vessel-derived Col15a1
promotes myocardial proliferation, and that its decrease in Ino80deficient embryonic hearts could contribute to the non-compaction phenotype.

To investigate the exogenous effects of the four factors on cardiomyocyte proliferation, ex vivo mouse embryonic heart tissue cultures
were prepared and analysed as described above (Figure 4E).
Phospho-H3 immunostaining showed that Tgfbi and Isg15 decreased
cardiomyocyte proliferation (Figure 6B). EdU assays showed that cardiomyocyte proliferation was significantly decreased with application
of 4F or each factor individually (Figure 6C). When the iPSC-CMs
were treated with 4F secreted factor cocktail or individually with
each one of the four factors on Day 15 of differentiation, we similarly
observed a decrease in the proliferation of the cells (Figure 6D).

Structural changes associated with non-compaction were also
investigated. It was noted that cardiomyocytes from explants
treated with 4F or individual factors were less densely packed
than controls (Figure 6E). The average distance between nuclei has
been previously used to measure cell packing,26,27 and this analysis
revealed an increase in nuclear distance and decrease in cell packing in non-compacted myocardium in vivo (Supplementary material
online, Figure S6). Using this metric to quantify explant cultures,
we observed the same phenomenon upon application of either 4F
or individual factors-they increased nuclei distance and a

seq with bulk RNA-seq datasets from human umbilical vein ECs treated with Ino80 siRNA and whole hearts from earlier time points (E13.5 and

decreased cell packing (Figure 6E-G). Therefore, these secreted
factors induce a 'spreading' of myocardium similar to that seen in
non-compacted hearts.
Another structural change we found to be characteristic of noncompacted myocardium was premature cardiomyocyte maturation.
Specifically, cardiomyocytes from Ino80 mutant hearts exhibited
more organized sarcomeres than controls at inappropriately early
developmental stages.7 Immunofluorescence for the sarcomeric

protein myomesin on 4F-treated and control iPSC-CMs showed that
both 4F and Tgfbi transformed the cells from circular with punctate
myomesin to elongated with more aligned sarcomeres, which is a
hallmark of maturation (Figure 6H). Thus, secreted factors whose expression was increased in Ino80-deficient endocardial and ECs suppress cardiomyocyte proliferation, a hallmark feature of ventricular
non-compaction. Another feature of cardiomyocyte maturation is a
change in electrophysiological properties. Action potential (AP)

recordings performed by patch-clamp showed that 4F treatment
increased the maximum upstroke velocity and the AP amplitude
compared with the non-treated cells (Figure 6I-K). Moreover, the
resting membrane potential of treated cells shifted from -60 to
-70 mV, a consequence of increased current through IK1 channels.28
These changes to AP and resting membrane potential indicate an enhancement of electrophysiological maturity. Taken together, these
data show that, in culture, endocardial-derived factors overexpressed
in Ino80-mutant ECs can drive the structural phenotypes seen in noncompacted hearts.

General inhibition of coronary
angiogenesis recapitulates noncompaction
Our observation that coronary vessels express a gene for a secreted
factor that stimulates cardiomyocyte proliferation suggests that general coronary angiogenesis could lead to non-compaction, irrespective of Ino80. To test this possibility, we specifically inhibited coronary
angiogenesis using a different genetic model and analysed ventricular
wall development. AplnCreER was used to delete VEGFR2 at E12.5
and E13.5 and analysis performed at E16.5 (Figure 7A). AplnCreER is
specific to coronary ECs in the developing heart29 and VEGFR2 is
required for general EC growth, allowing us to specifically inhibit coronary angiogenesis without affecting the endocardium.
Quantification of trabecular and compact myocardial width in these
animals at E16.5 revealed a defect in compact expansion at the expense of over-developed trabeculae (Figure 7B and C). This is a hallmark of the non-compaction phenotype, and, therefore, we

Discussion
Here, we used a mouse model with endothelial genetic insufficiency
(EC-specific Ino80 deletion) to study the potential role of vascularderived factors in normal and pathological heart wall growth. We
performed scRNA-seq of Ino80 mutant hearts to investigate the cell
state changes that accompany LVNC and to precisely characterize
cell-type-specific changes in gene expression. This analysis revealed a
new endocardial cell state specific to Ino80 mutant hearts that was
characterized by an increase in proliferation genes, which localized to

non-compacted myocardium. We also used the scRNA-seq data, as
well as additional human datasets, to investigate which cells express
genes associated with human LVNC. The results showed that
LVNC-associated genes are expressed in both cardiomyocytes and
the other stromal cell types within the heart. Thus, scRNA-seq analysis revealed that perturbations in endocardial and ECs accompany
ventricular non-compaction in mice and suggested potential sites of
origins for the human disease.32
Using scRNA-seq to identify gene expression differences within
specific cell types, we identified five candidate secreted factors that
endocardial or coronary ECs might use to influence cardiomyocyte
behaviour. Among these was Col15a1, which was expressed by coronary vessel ECs and was decreased in Ino80 mutants, suggesting it
might function to support cardiomyocyte proliferation. In murine explant cultures, recombinant Col15a1 stimulated cardiomyocyte

possibility that an initial hypoxic state might start a pathologic feedback loop that exacerbates non-compaction.
In summary, we identified a novel set of endothelial- and endocardial-expressed secreted during cardiac development that simultaneously modulates cardiomyocyte proliferation and
maturation, two key cellular processes critical for ventricular
compaction. These findings shed light into an unprecedented aetiology of LVNC, whereby dysregulation of paracrine signalling of
non-cardiomyocyte cell types can lead to reduced cardiomyocyte
proliferation and myocardial non-compaction. Consequently, further elucidation of these phenomena will be necessary to develop
effective patient-specific therapeutics to combat the complex
pathological nature of LVNC.

proliferation. Application of Col15a1 to explant cultures that mimic
LVNC-Ino80 deficient or treated with VEGFR2 inhibitor-rescued
proliferation defects. It also rescued the poor proliferative response
of iPSC-CMs derived from a patient with LVNC. Little is known
about the molecular function of Col15a1, but it is mostly found in the
basement membrane of capillary ECs and smooth muscle cells.33-35
Adult Col15a1 constitutive knockout mice are viable, but exhibit progressive evidence of muscular disease, including cardiac function deficiencies and cardiomyocyte structural defects.36,37 Col15a1 has also
been shown to bind to fibronectin and laminin to influence cell adhesion,38 and thus these two cell types may be working together to produce an extracellular matrix environment that promotes
cardiomyocyte proliferation and, as a result, support compaction.
Future experiments will delve into precisely how Col15a1 stimulates
cardiomyocyte proliferation.
Comparing differential expression also identified several genes
highly up-regulated in Ino80-deficient endocardial cells and coronary
ECs. This caused us to consider the hypothesis of a disease-promoting function. This is a reasonable role for the endocardium since it
was overrepresented in Ino80 mutants where it lined non-compacted myocardium. Indeed, even in normal hearts, endocardial cells
are associated with non-proliferative trabecular myocardium. The
proteins encoded by the up-regulated genes-Tgfbi, Igfbp3, Isg15,
and Adm-reduced proliferation of mouse and human cardiomyocytes and induced phenotypic changes, such as elongated morphology with increased sarcomere formation and physiological
maturation, consistent with it facilitating the onset of the LVNC
phenotype.
These four factors carry out a variety of functions. TGFBI is a
secreted protein that has been reported to bind to a variety of extracellular matrix molecules and interacts with integrins through its
C-terminal RGD domain.39-41 Integrins are highly expressed in cardiomyocytes,42,43 and are known to be involved in sarcomere assembly
and maturation.44 IGFBP3 can bind and inhibit the function of insulinlike growth factors (IGFs),45 which stimulate cardiomyocyte proliferation.46 IGFBP3 has also been shown to bind the cell surface receptor
LRP147 and be internalized and perform various intercellular functions.48 Ubiquitin-like protein ISG15 is known to be strongly induced
by type I interferons and can covalently conjugate itself to potentially
hundreds of targets to regulate their function.49-51 Finally, ADM is a
peptide hormone that is secreted by endothelial and vascular smooth
muscle cells and has been reported to have protective effects in
many pathological conditions, including cardiac hypertrophy, myocardial infarction, and atherosclerosis.52,53 It has been reported to directly bind cardiomyocytes through its receptors e.g. CRLR and
RAMPs, although the downstream consequences of signalling have
yet to be investigated.54,55 It will thus be necessary to explore their
precise role in regulating cardiomyocyte behaviour in compacting
mouse hearts and in the human iPSC-CMs.
Consistent with the hypoxic hallmark in cardiomyocytes from
Ino80 mutant hearts, two of the genes up-regulated in Ino80 mutant
endocardium and/or endothelium (Igfbp3 and Adm) are known to be
hypoxia-inducible and their change was not seen in non-hypoxic
Ino80 knockdown cell culture experiments or in bulk RNA-seq from
stages that should be prior to onset of hypoxia. Their hypoxia inducibility along with their effects on cardiomyocytes suggests the

Translational Perspective
Left ventricular non-compaction (LVNC) is a disease characterized by the inability of the myocardium to compact, severely affecting
heart function and leading to mortality. The aetiology is poorly understood, but knowledge regarding the pathophysiology could lead to
novel therapeutic interventions. Evidence suggests that defects in vascular endothelium/endocardium can contribute to LVNC development. Using a mouse model, we identify proteins expressed in vascular cells that induce cardiomyocyte responses that cause non-compaction. We also identify a protein expressed in normal endothelial cells that has the opposite effect. These studies can inspire
development of clinical strategies aimed at understanding and treating non-compaction cardiomyopathy.
