Aims

Patients are restricted from driving following implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implantation or shock.
We sought to investigate how many patients are aware of, and adhere to, the driving restrictions, and what proportion experience an ICD shock or other cardiac symptoms while driving.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
We performed a nationwide survey of all living Danish residents 18 years or older who received a first-time ICD
and results
between 2013 and 2016 (n = 3913) and linked their responses with nationwide registers. Of 2741 respondents

(47% primary prevention, 83% male, median age 67 years), 2513 (92%) held a valid driver's license at ICD implantation, 175 (7%) of whom had a license for professional driving. Many drivers were unaware of driving restrictions:
primary prevention 58%; secondary prevention 36%; post-appropriate shock 28%; professional drivers 55%. Almost
all (94%) resumed non-professional driving after ICD implantation, more than one-third during the restricted
period; 35% resumed professional driving. During a median follow-up of 2.3 years, 5 (0.2%) reported receiving an
ICD shock while driving, one of which resulted in a traffic accident. The estimated risk of harm was 0.0002% per
person-year.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
In this nationwide study, many ICD patients were unaware of driving restrictions, and more than one third
resumed driving during a driving restriction period. However, the rate of reported ICD shocks while driving was
very low.

Introduction
Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) significantly reduce the
risk of sudden cardiac death, both in survivors of malignant ventricular arrhythmias (secondary prevention) and in patients at increased
risk of sudden cardiac arrest (primary prevention).1-3
Concern about the risk of sudden incapacitation while driving led
to driving restrictions in patients following ICD implantation or ICD
therapy. Current guidelines from the European Society of Cardiology
(ESC) recommend a 3-month restriction following secondary prevention ICD implantation or appropriate ICD shock, and a 1-month
restriction following primary prevention ICD implantation.4
American Heart Association guidelines are more restrictive, recommending a 6-month driving ban following ICD implantation for secondary prevention or appropriate ICD therapy.5 Both groups
recommend permanent restriction of professional driving and driving
of vehicles above 3500 kg.4,5
Driving is considered a basic necessity by many people, and inability to drive may severely limit individuals and adversely affect their
quality of life.6 Whether driving restrictions for contemporary ICD
patients are needed to ensure safety has been much discussed.7,8
Recent advances in device programming, pharmacological management, and catheter ablation for ventricular tachycardia underline the
need for updated data to guide policy about driving for ICD
patients.9-12
Although implantation rates are increasing worldwide,13 there are
few data describing driving behaviour of unselected contemporary

Questionnaire development and distribution
Development of the questionnaire has been described elsewhere.21
Briefly, we constructed the questionnaire based on a systematic review
of the literature and findings of semi-structured focus group interviews
(n = 10). Overall, pre-testing by cognitive interviewing (n = 28), pilot testing (n = 50), and test-retesting (n = 25) demonstrated good content validity, feasible data collection methods, a robust response rate, and
good reliability of the questionnaire items.21 We applied branching methods to guide the individual respondents through the questionnaire.
Consequently, the denominator for the different questionnaire items
may vary.
ICD recipients who reported not holding a valid driver's licence at
time of ICD implantation were excluded from further questions. In line
with European and Danish guidelines, we defined private driving as driving
of regular cars, motorcycles or tractors, and large vehicle and professional driving as driving of vehicles >3500 kg or any driving for professional
purposes, including passenger transportation.4,22
We mailed study invitations on May 16, 2017 urging participants to
complete an anonymous, web-based questionnaire using a patient-specific code (they could request a paper version). After 3 weeks, we mailed
non-responders a reminder along with a paper version of the questionnaire (Supplementary material online). All paper-based responses were
entered into the web-based questionnaire software (SurveyXact,
Ramboll A/S23) by double manual entry.

Data sources
We identified patients and retrieved data from the Danish Pacemaker
and ICD register24 on indication for implantation (primary or secondary
prevention), New York Heart Association functional class, and left ventricular ejection fraction. We identified comorbidities and hospital contacts following motor vehicle accidents from discharge diagnosis codes
registered in the Danish National Patient Register25-27 and pharmacotherapy through Anatomic Therapeutical Chemical codes in the Danish
Register for Medicinal Product Statistics.28 We utilized the Danish
Register of Causes of Death to identify ICD recipients who had died due
to a motor vehicle accident prior to questionnaire distribution29
(Supplementary material online, Table S1).
We retrieved each patient's updated address, vital status, sex, date of
birth, and emigration history from the Danish Civil Registration System
and obtained data on educational attainment and personal income from
Statistics Denmark. Lastly, we used the patient's residence municipality
code to characterize the degree of urbanization, according to Eurostat
classifications.30

..
.. Statistical analyses
.. The questionnaire response rate was calculated using the American
..
.. Association for Public Opinion Research's Response Rate Calculator, ver.. sion 9.31 We defined all returned questionnaires, partial or complete, as
..
.. responders and performed all analyses on an available case basis without
.. imputation for item non-response. We did not apply any weighting meth..
.. ods to adjust for non-response bias. Thus, estimates of population param.. eters are not reported.
..
We compared continuous variables using Wilcoxon rank-sum test
..
.. and dichotomous variables using chi-square or Fisher's exact test, as ap.. propriate. We assessed statistical significance as a two-sided P-value of
..
.. <0.05.
..
Non-adherence to driving restrictions was defined as resumption of
..
.. driving within the guideline-recommended restricted periods and we
.. applied multivariable logistic regression models to estimate the odds
..
.. ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for risk factors associ.. ated with non-adherence (Supplementary material online). We estimated
..
.. the incidence rates and their 95% CIs of cardiac symptoms while driving
.. per 10 000 person-hour spent driving from reported driving habits
..
.. (Supplementary material online).
..
Based on patient-reported data on ICD shocks while driving, we calcu..
lated
a modified risk of harm (RH), as has been done previously.32 The
..
.. RH formula, developed by the Canadian Cardiology Society in 199233
.. and adopted by guidelines worldwide,4,20,34 attempts to quantify the risk
..
.. of death or injury to other road users posed by a patient with heart dis.. ease as:
..
..
RH = TD  SCI  V  Ac. Here, TD represents proportion of time
.. spent driving (normally set at 0.04/1 h per day for private drivers, and
..
.. 0.25/6 h per day for professional drivers); SCI is the time-dependent risk
.. of sudden cardiac incapacitation, for ICD patients equalling the risk of
..
.. ICD shock multiplied by the probability that an ICD shock will lead to
.. syncope (the latter typically set to 0.14 or 0.3235,36); V is the risk depend..
.. ing on type of vehicle (0.28 for standard passenger cars or 1.0 for com.. mercial heavy trucks); and Ac is the probability that an event while driving
..
.. will result in death or injury to others (normally set at 0.02 per event).33,37
.. We defined TD  SCI as the percent of respondents reporting ICD
.. shock while driving per patient-year  the estimated risk of syncope with
..
.. ICD shock (0.32). In additional scenario analyses, we assumed the rate of
.. ICD shocks while driving was 2, 5 and 20 higher than reported by the
..
.. respondents to account for potential underreporting.
..
We performed statistical analyses using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute
..
.. Inc., Cary, NC, USA) and R (version 3.5, R Foundation for Statistical
.. Computing).
..
..
.. Ethical considerations
..
.. The study complies with the Declaration of Helsinki and was reported to
.. the regional Ethical Committee which concluded no ethical approval was
..
.. needed (reference number H-17002489). However, the study was regis.. tered and approved by the data responsible institute (Capital Region of
..
.. Denmark, P-2019-051). Approval to obtain current addresses on the
.. study participants was granted by the Danish Health Data Authority
..
.. (FSEID-2420). Participants were informed that responding to the
.. questionnaire was considered providing informed consent. Neither ques.. tionnaire nor cover letter included specific information about the guide..
.. line-recommended driving restrictions. Danish data protection legislation
.. prohibits detailed reporting of register-based observations with counts
..
. <3, but not from data solely generated from questionnaire responses.

trial are also included in our cohort.18 Secondary prevention ICD recipients were cardiac arrest survivors or patients with documented hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.19
Danish recommendations restricted ICD patients from private driving
(motorcycle, car, and tractor; Group 1 license) for 1 week or 1 month following primary prevention ICD implantation, depending on whether
home monitoring was established. After secondary prevention ICD implantation or delivery of an appropriate ICD shock, patients were
restricted from driving for 3 months. In contrast to ESC guidelines,4 there
were no restrictions following appropriate anti-tachycardia pacing therapy. Professional driving and driving of vehicles >3500 kg (Group 2 license) was permanently restricted.20 Danish ICD recipients keep their
license card, and the police is not routinely informed about driving
restrictions for medical reasons.

were predominantly male (83%) and had a median age of 67 [interquartile range (IQR): 59-73] years (Table 1).
Compared with responders, the 1130 non-responders were significantly younger, more likely to be female, primary prevention ICD
recipients, have more comorbidities, receive less guideline-recommended pharmacotherapy, and have a lower socioeconomic status.
Non-responders and responders had similar rates of motor vehicle
accidents requiring medical evaluation following ICD implantation
(0.6% vs. 0.3%, P = 0.135) (Supplementary material online, Table S3).
None of these accidents occurred within 6 months following ICD
implantation.
Almost all patients (n = 2513, 92%) held a valid driver's license at
ICD implantation, 175 (7%) of whom were also using a license for
professional driving or driving of large vehicles within the 6 months
prior to ICD implantation (Table 2).

Information on driving restrictions
Among those with a valid private driver's license (n = 2513), 58%
(n = 652) of primary prevention and 36% (n = 474) of secondary prevention patients reported that they were unaware of driving restrictions following ICD implantation (Table 3). Of the 54% (n = 1339),
who reported being informed of any restrictions, 54% (n = 717)
reported being informed of the guideline-recommended restricted
periods following ICD implantation. Fewer primary prevention
patients (29%) than secondary prevention patients (67%) recalled
being informed about the correct restrictions. Only 45% (n = 79) of
active professional drivers reported having been informed about specific restrictions for professional or large vehicle driving. Following
appropriate ICD shock (n = 131), 72% (n = 94) reported they had
been informed about driving restrictions (Table 3). Recall of receipt
of information was slightly better in responders with more recent
ICD implantations (Supplementary material online, Figure S2).

..
.. Resumption of driving
.. Following ICD implantation, 2344 (94%) patients resumed driving,
..
.. with no significant difference between primary and secondary pre.. vention patients (P = 0.14) (Supplementary material online, Table S4).
..
.. The median time to resumption of driving following implantation was
.. 8 days (IQR: 3-21) for primary prevention patients and 90 days (IQR:
..
.. 21-90) for secondary prevention patients. Of the 131 patients who
.. had experienced an appropriate ICD shock, 120 also provided infor..
.. mation about driving resumption and 94% of them resumed driving
..
.. following the shock at a median time of 90 days (IQR: 30-90)
.. (Figure 1). Lastly, 35% (n = 62) of the active professional drivers had
..
.. resumed professional or large vehicle driving with a median time to
.. resumption of 29 days (IQR: 10-90): 66% of these reported they
..
.. were truck, bus, or taxi drivers.
..
..
.. Non-adherence
.. 2290 ICD recipients reported when they had resumed private driving
..
.. following ICD implantation or appropriate ICD shock. Among these,
.. 34% of primary prevention patients, 43% of secondary prevention
..
.. patients, and 30% of those who experienced an appropriate ICD
.. shock had resumed driving during the recommended restricted peri..
.. ods (Figure 1). The proportion of patients driving within the restricted
..
.. periods was significantly higher among those unaware of driving
.. restrictions, as compared with patients who reported being informed
..
.. (P < 0.001). However, for secondary prevention patients and after
.. appropriate shock, resumption of driving within the restricted period
..
.. was almost equally distributed between patients who were informed
.. and those who were not (Figure 2).

In a multivariable logistic regression model, significant predictors of

3.58) and age >60 years (OR: 0.44, 95% CI: 0.27-0.72) were significant predictors (Supplementary material online, Figure S4).

Cardiac symptoms while driving
During a median period of 2.3 years (IQR: 1.3-3.4), 316 (13%)
reported experiencing an ICD shock (primary prevention: 9%; secondary prevention: 16%, P = 0.023), the majority reporting the shock
was appropriate (primary prevention: 38%; secondary prevention:
46%). Inappropriate shocks constituted 13% and 22% of shocks for
primary and secondary prevention patients, respectively. The remaining shocks were reported as of unknown aetiology.
Only 5 (0.2%) of the patients who had resumed driving after
ICD implantation reported receiving an ICD shock while driving,
and another 5 (0.2%) patients reported syncope (unrelated to
ICD shock therapy) while driving (Supplementary material online,
Table S5). This corresponded to a risk of 0.10% per patient-year.

driving resulted in a motor vehicle accident. Calculating a theoretical RH, the risk to other road users posed by the ICD
patients in our cohort would be: 0.01  0.32 (TD  SCI: percent experiencing ICD shock while driving per patient-year and
the risk of syncope in relation with ICD shock)  0.28 (V: private vehicle)  0.02 (Ac: incapacitation causing injuring accident)
= 0.0002% per person-year. Assuming the responders' rate of
ICD shocks while driving was 20 times higher than reported by
the patients over the same follow-up time resulted in an RH of
0.003% (Supplementary material online, Table S6).
All patients experiencing an ICD shock while driving were male
with a median age of 64 years and none were professional drivers.
Three of five patients had adhered to driving guidelines. We are unaware whether the remaining two ICD shocks occurred within a
restricted period.
Dizziness, palpitations, and chest pain while driving were more
common events (Supplementary material online, Table S5), but none
resulted in a motor vehicle accident.

Discussion

.. for study participation had died due to a motor vehicle accident prior

..
Few prior studies have investigated the risk of ICD discharge and
..
.. arrhythmic symptoms while driving.14-16,46 In a survey sub-study
..
.. from the AVID (Antiarrhythmics vs. Implantable Defibrillators) trial,
.. 8% of the 295 ICD recipients reported receiving an ICD shock while
..
.. driving.16 However, the AVID trial included survivors of ventricular
.. arrhythmias between 1993 and 1997, prior to advances in medical
..
.. treatment and device programming. Likewise in a secondary preven.. tion ICD population, 7 of 1106 (0.6%) patients from the TOVA
..
.. (Triggers of Ventricular Arrhythmia) trial experienced an ICD shock
.. while driving over a median follow-up time of 562 days, and only one
..
.. ICD shock resulted in an accident.46 Lastly, in a more recent, but
.. smaller study of 241 ICD patients, 8 patients (3.3%) received an ICD
..
.. shock while driving, corresponding to an annual risk of shock while
.. driving of 1.5%.15 However, their shock rate was twice as high as in
..
.. our cohort and half of shocks were inappropriate.
..
Using our data to calculate a potential RH, we estimated the risk of
..
.. serious injury or death to other road users would be 0.0002% per
.. person-year, lower than the typically accepted threshold of 0.005%.4
..
.. There are several caveats in the RH formula, most importantly that
..
.. the assumptions are based on historical data.8,33 Moreover, the
.. patients in our cohort might have driven less than the 7 hours per
..
.. week used in the RH formula or been reluctant to answer truthfully.
.. Still, when assuming the rate of ICD shocks while driving was 20
..
.. times higher than reported, the RH remained below 0.005%. Lastly,
.. those refraining from driving might be more likely to have experi..
.. enced symptoms of possible arrhythmia.
..
Nevertheless, the rates of ICD shock and syncope while driving in
..
.. our cohort are the lowest reported yet, despite more than one third
.. of patients recommencing driving within guideline-recommended
..
.. restricted periods. While this study does not provide sufficient evi.. dence to rescind current driving restrictions for ICD patients, we be..
.. lieve our data suggest the potential risk to other road users posed by
.. contemporary ICD patients appears to be quite low.
..
..
.. Strengths and limitations
..
.. The major strengths of our study include its nationwide scope, real.. life setting, the large size of the cohort, its linkage with administrative
..
.. registers, and the high response rate to the survey. The study has the
.. inherent limitations of all survey research.47 By only including patients
..
.. who were alive at time of questionnaire distribution, we have inevit..
.. ably introduced a survivor and healthy participant bias. Similarly, we
.. found the non-responders did in fact differ significantly from the res..

.. Patients who had ignored driving restrictions or experienced ICD

.. shock while driving, may have been less likely to respond. Also, the
.. risk that some patients may have answered untruthfully remains.
..
Recall bias is also a significant concern, especially because of our

.. relatively long follow-up of up to 4.5 years, high median age of res..

This nationwide survey study of >2700 contemporary ICD patients
demonstrates that many ICD patients were unaware of recommended driving restrictions following implantation and appropriate
ICD shock. Furthermore, up to 43% of private drivers and 35% of
professional and large vehicle drivers had resumed driving during
restricted periods. Nevertheless, only 5 (0.2%) individuals reported
receiving an ICD shock while driving (Graphical Abstract).
Our results are consistent with previous studies of selected
patients showing that physician-recommended driving restrictions
are often not given or not recalled by patients,14,15,38 that almost all
patients resume driving following ICD implantation,15,16 and that
many patients resume driving before restricted periods have
ended.14-16,38 Secondary prevention patients, subject to a 3-month
restricted period following ICD implantation, were more likely to resume driving prematurely than primary prevention patients only subject to a 1-week restriction. There is considerable heterogeneity in
driving restrictions worldwide,39 and adherence might be poorer in
countries recommending a driving ban of 6 months or more following
ICD implantation or ICD therapy.
Not surprisingly, we found that patients who said they were not
informed about driving restrictions were less likely to follow them.
Recall and comprehension of discharge instructions can be problematic, especially in older patients, and our results are within the ranges
following other medical admissions.40-42 Clearly, a stronger focus on
communicating driving restrictions to patients is warranted, which
might improve adherence.21 Discharge discussions should include
patients' next of kin and simple communication tools, for example
'teach-back methods', could prove helpful.40,43 Information should be
given in writing, and special patient discharge programs could also be
valuable.40,44
However, almost half of secondary prevention and appropriate
shock patients who resumed driving too early reported they had in
fact been informed about driving restrictions. That many consider
driving to be almost a basic human right, and that driving restrictions
can significantly interfere with everyday life and undermine the
patient's self-image, could explain why many patients ignore physician's advice.45
It was alarming that 55% of ICD patients who were driving large
vehicles or driving professionally reported they had not been
informed about the stricter limitations on their driving and 35% had
resumed driving professionally. Both American and European guidelines agree that professional driving should be permanently banned
due to the number of hours spent behind the wheel and the potential
greater impact caused by larger vehicles.4,5 Based on our results, special focus on identifying professional drivers seems reasonable.
Our study subjects reported a very low rate of ICD shocks while
driving: only 0.2% reported receipt of an ICD shock while driving during a median of 2.3 years of follow-up, corresponding to 0.05 events
per 10,000 person-hours spent driving. This rate is uncertain, since
approximately 10% of eligible patients had died or emigrated before
questionnaire distribution, and 29% never responded. However, in
analysis of nationwide hospital encounters, non-responders and responders had similar rates of motor vehicle accidents requiring medical evaluation, suggesting that the estimate is not biased by survey
non-response. Also, less than three ICD recipients otherwise eligible

nor do we have information about device programming.
Furthermore, the questionnaire did not include questions regarding
motor vehicle accidents in general, so we cannot report what proportion of accidents were due to ICD therapy. Lastly, although our
results on recall of restrictions and the adherence to them were
comparable to published data from other societies, cross-country
generalization can be problematic due to differences in health care
systems, driving culture, and legislation.

In this large nationwide survey study, up to 58% of ICD patients were
unaware of the driving restrictions, and more than one-third, including professional drivers, resumed driving within the restricted periods. Despite a high proportion of patients resuming driving
prematurely, only 0.2% of respondents reported receipt of ICD
shock while driving. This corresponded to an estimated RH of
0.0002% per person-year, suggesting a low RH to other road users
posed by ICD patients.
