Aims

The aim of this study was to generate a biomarker-driven prognostic tool for patients with chronic HFrEF.
Circulating levels of N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T
(hs-cTnT) each have a marked positive relationship with adverse outcomes in heart failure with reduced ejection
fraction (HFrEF). A risk model incorporating biomarkers and clinical variables has not been validated in contemporary heart failure (HF) trials.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
In EMPEROR-Reduced, 33 candidate variables were pre-selected. Multivariable Cox regression models were developed using stepwise selection for: (i) the primary composite outcome of HF hospitalization or cardiovascular death,
and results
(ii) all-cause death, and (iii) cardiovascular mortality. A total of 3730 patients were followed up for a median of
16 months, 823 (22%) patients had a primary outcome and 515 (14%) patients died, of whom 389 (10%) died from
a cardiovascular cause. NT-proBNP and hs-cTnT were the dominant predictors of the primary outcome, and in
addition, a shorter time since last HF hospitalization, longer time since HF diagnosis, lower systolic blood pressure,
New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV, higher heart rate and peripheral oedema were key predictors
(eight variables in total, all P < 0.001). The primary outcome risk score discriminated well (c-statistic = 0.73), with
patients in the top 10th of risk having an event rate >9 times higher than those in the bottom 10th. Empagliflozin
benefitted patients across risk levels for the primary outcome. NT-proBNP and hs-cTnT were also the dominant
predictors of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, followed by NYHA Class III or IV and ischaemic aetiology
(four variables in total, all P < 0.001). The mortality risk model presented good event discrimination for all-cause
and cardiovascular mortality (c-statistic = 0.69 for both). These simple models were externally validated in the
BIOSTAT-CHF study, achieving similar c-statistics.

Conclusions

S.J. Pocock et al.

The combination of NT-proBNP and hs-cTnT with a small number of readily available clinical variables provides
prognostic assessment for patients with HFrEF. This predictive tool kit can be easily implemented for routine clinical use.

Introduction
Patients with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction
(HFrEF) have a variable prognosis that may depend on patients' characteristics, healthcare and social determinants, and treatments that
modify the course of the disease.1
Prognostic models have been developed to capture the overall
risk of each individual patient, thus allowing a better allocation of
resources, therapies, and care organization strategies (e.g. nurse-led
programmes or telemonitoring).2 A multitude of prognostic models
has been developed in recent years. For example, the Seattle Heart
Failure Model3 and the Meta-Analysis Global Group in Chronic
Heart Failure (MAGGIC) score4 are tools that can be used to predict
heart failure (HF) and survival outcomes in a clinical setting.
However, these prognostic models were developed before the

implementation of recent therapies that impact HFrEF outcomes
[e.g. angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor and sodium-glucose
cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i)], and they do not incorporate
biomarkers with strong prognostic value, e.g. N-terminal pro B-type
natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT). More recent prognostic models have included natriuretic peptides but not hs-cTnT (e.g. the PREDICT-HF5 and
BIOSTAT-CHF6), despite the importance of both biomarkers in predicting events,7 and they were developed before the advent of
SGLT2i. Moreover, these models include a large number of clinical
and laboratory variables as well as treatments, which necessarily limit
their clinical implementation. For example, the PREDICT-HF score
includes 30 variables for the prediction of all-cause mortality.5

Reduced) trial, which assessed NT-proBNP and hs-cTnT in a contemporary setting, we developed simple and ready to implement
biomarker-driven models for predicting the individual patient incidence of the composite of HF hospitalization or cardiovascular death,
all-cause mortality, and cardiovascular mortality. These models can
be incorporated into a biomarker-driven toolkit to facilitate appropriate individual patient management.

Study design
EMPEROR-Reduced: derivation cohort
The design and primary results of the EMPEROR-Reduced trial
(NCT03057977) have been previously reported.8,9 In brief, 3730 patients
with chronic HF and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 40% or
less were randomized to receive placebo (n = 1867) or empagliflozin
10 mg daily (n = 1863). To prioritize the recruitment of higher-risk
patients, either a hospitalization within 12 months of study enrolment or
a meaningfully elevated NT-proBNP was required for study inclusion.
The NT-proBNP inclusion criteria were >_600, 1000, and 2500 pg/mL in
patients with LVEF <_30%, 31-35%, and 36-40%, respectively, and these
thresholds were doubled in patients with atrial fibrillation. There was no
eligibility criterion related to hs-cTnT.
The primary endpoint of EMPEROR-Reduced was time-to-first event
in a composite of HF hospitalization or cardiovascular death. The mode
of death and hospitalizations for HF were independently adjudicated by a
blinded committee based on pre-specified criteria. The median follow-up
time was 16 months.
Blood was collected for the measurement of NT-proBNP (expressed
in pg/mL) and hs-cTnT (expressed in ng/L) (Roche Diagnostics, RischRotkreuz, Switzerland) at baseline and measured in a central laboratory
(using a Roche ElecsysV cobas analyzer). The institutional review board of
each study site approved all study procedures and all patients provided
informed consent.
R

BIOSTAT-CHF: validation cohort
From 2010 to 2012, BIOSTAT-CHF enrolled 2516 patients with worsening HF on lower than guideline-recommended doses of HF medication to
investigate the factors influencing the up-titration of HF therapies. The
design and first results of the study have been published.10 Briefly, patients
were aged >_18 years with signs and symptoms of worsening HF managed
either in an outpatient setting or in an inpatient setting. The diagnosis of
HF was confirmed either by an LVEF <_40%, or B-type natriuretic peptide
or NT-proBNP plasma levels >400 and/or >2000 pg/mL, respectively
(without an entry cut-off point for hs-cTnT) and by treatment with oral
or intravenous furosemide >_40 mg/day or equivalent. Patients were
treatment naive or were receiving <50% of target doses of angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers and betablockers. During a median follow-up of 21 months, hospitalizations for
HF were identified by each treating physician, and cardiovascular mortality was centrally adjudicated by Dr Adriaan A. Voors.
Baseline blood measurements of NT-proBNP (expressed in pg/mL)
and hs-cTnT (expressed in ng/L) (Roche Diagnostics) were measured in a
central laboratory using a Roche ElecsysV cobas analyzer. Ethics board
approval was obtained, and all participants signed written informed consent before entering the study.

categories of approximately equal size. For NT-proBNP, we
observed a strong monotonic risk gradient, with those in the top fifth
(>_4097 pg/mL) having a HR of 3.52 (95% CI 2.69-4.59) as compared
to those in the bottom fifth (<_970 pg/mL). For hs-cTnT, the risk gradient was slightly less marked, with the corresponding top fifth vs.
bottom fifth (>_37.7 vs. <13.7 ng/L) having a HR of 2.54 (95% CI 1.94-
3.32). The inverse association of SBP with risk is far less marked:
when comparing the bottom fifth vs. top fifth (<107 vs.
>_136 mmHg), the HR was 1.66 (95% CI 1.33-2.06), but its contribution remained significant (P < 0.0001). The risk gradient was also less
marked for heart rate, when comparing the bottom fifth vs. top fifth
(<61 vs. >_80 b.p.m.) with a HR of 1.42 (95% CI 1.13-1.77).
The goodness of fit and strength of prediction for this
model-based on eight baseline predictors plus randomized
treatment-are displayed in Figure 2A. A risk score (based on
the coefficients in Table 1) has its distribution divided into 10
equal-sized groups. In each decile, there is good agreement between the observed and predicted patient risk, both expressed
as the percentage having a primary event at 2 years. Comparing
top and bottom deciles of risk, the observed event rates are
71.8% and 8.5%, respectively.
The strength of prediction for the primary outcome is captured by
the c-statistic of 0.729 (95% CI 0.711-0.746). We considered the option of extending the model to include other predictors that each
achieved P-value <0.01 rather than the more stringent P-value
<0.001; this would have added neutrophils, bilirubin, and potassium.
The addition of these variables would have greatly increased the

complexity of the model, without meaningful gain in terms of
strength of prediction (c-statistic = 0.733). Of note, a more complex
model (the PREDICT-HF risk score) included >20 baseline variables,5
but when applied to the EMPEROR-Reduced database, the
PREDICT-HF score strength for prediction of the primary outcome
was lower (c-statistic = 0.704).
To evaluate the effect of empagliflozin at different levels of patient
risk, we calculated a risk score using coefficients for the eight significant predictors in Table 1 (excluding the coefficient for randomized
treatment), and we stratified patients into equal-sized thirds of risk,
each containing over 1200 patients per risk tertile. Figure 3A shows
the HR and 95% CIs for the primary outcome by tertiles of risk. All
three showed a statistically significant relative reduction in risk of the
primary outcome with empagliflozin, with a more marked relative reduction in low-risk patients (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.40-0.89) and less
marked relative reduction in high-risk patients (HR 0.83, 95% CI
0.69-0.99) (P for trend = 0.09). Figure 3B shows the absolute differences in risk for the same tertiles, expressed as the treatment difference
in primary event rate per 100 patient-years. On an absolute scale, the
reverse trend for the magnitude of the effect of empagliflozin was apparent (compared with the trend for relative risk reduction): rate difference -3.1 vs. -7.3 per 100 patient-years in low- and high-risk
patients, respectively (P for trend = 0.26). Kaplan-Meier plots of the
primary outcome over 24 months by risk tertiles and by treatment
group demonstrated that empagliflozin reduced the cumulative incidence of a primary event at all levels of patient risk (Supplementary
material online, Figure S3).

Novel biomarker-driven prognostic models

All-cause and cardiovascular mortality
Death from any cause occurred in 515 (14%) of the 3730
patients: 249 in the empagliflozin group and 266 in the placebo
group, with a HR of 0.92 (95% CI 0.77-1.10). A new risk model
for mortality using the same set of candidate predictors yielded
only four variables that achieved the inclusion criterion of Pvalue <0.001 (Table 2). NT-proBNP and hs-cTnT remained the
most dominant risk factors for mortality, followed by NYHA
functional Class III or IV and ischaemic (vs. non-ischaemic) HF.
The consequent c-statistic = 0.687 (95% CI 0.661-0.713) and
Figure 2B showed the model goodness-of-fit and strength of prediction. Figure 4 depicts how NT-proBNP and hs-cTnT are independently associated with mortality.
A cardiovascular cause accounted for 76% of all deaths (n = 389):
187 in empagliflozin and 202 in placebo, with a HR of 0.92 (95% CI
0.75-1.12). Applying the all-cause mortality risk model to cardiovascular mortality yielded a statistically identical discrimination (c-statistic = 0.688, 95% CI 0.658-0.716).
We also explored a new risk model for cardiovascular death, but
all gave results that were similar to the all-cause mortality model,
with NT-proBNP and hs-cTnT being the most powerful predictors,
followed by NYHA class and ischaemic aetiology. The c-statistic was

0.69 for both all-cause and cardiovascular mortality (Supplementary
material online, Table S2).
Biomarker combination for risk prediction
Given the dominant roles of NT-proBNP and hs-cTnT in influencing
patient risks of the primary outcome and all-cause death, we
explored how risk was affected by these biomarkers. In
Supplementary material online, Table S3 and Figure 5, we simultaneously stratified both NT-proBNP and hs-cTnT into equal-sized
thirds of their individual distribution and then showed how the event
rates of the primary outcome and all-cause death varied according to
these 9 patient groups. Patients with both the lowest NT-proBNP
and lowest hs-cTnT had an event rate of 5.1 per 100 patient-years
compared to 43.3 per 100 patient-years in those with both the highest NT-proBNP and the highest hs-cTnT, with a rate ratio of 8.5. For
all-cause death, a similar pattern emerged, with rate ratio for the two
extremes (highest-highest vs. lowest-lowest) of 6.2. The two biomarkers were positively correlated: patients with lowest-lowest and
highest-highest biomarker values occurred in 619 and 619 patients,
respectively, whereas highest-lowest and lowest-highest occurred in
only 249 and 219 patients, respectively. The Pearson correlation for
the values of log NT-proBNP and log hs-cTnT was r = 0.36.

BIOSTAT-CHF external validation
The models derived from EMPEROR-Reduced were applied to 1828
patients from BIOSTAT-CHF with an LVEF <_40% in whom both NTproBNP and hs-cTnT were available. In BIOSTAT-CHF, 599 (33%)
patients experienced the composite of HF hospitalization or cardiovascular death and 432 (24%) died, of whom 329 (76%) died from a
cardiovascular cause.
Application of the EMPEROR-Reduced risk score for all-cause
mortality to the same outcome in BIOSTAT-CHF achieved a c-statistic of 0.712. The EMPEROR-Reduced risk score for all-cause mortality applied to cardiovascular mortality in BIOSTAT-CHF achieved a
slightly better discrimination, with a c-statistic of 0.730.
The EMPEROR-Reduced model could not be used for validating
the composite of HF hospitalization or cardiovascular death in
BIOSTAT-CHF because time since HF diagnosis was not available in
BIOSTAT-CHF, and the time since most recent HF hospitalization
was recorded only as an event within the previous year (yes vs. no).
To accommodate these limitations, we re-computed a modified
EMPEROR-Reduced risk score to remove the time since HF diagnosis from the model and include prior HF hospitalization as a dichotomous variable based on whether the patient had or not been
hospitalized for HF within the previous year. The c-statistics of this
modified model were 0.710 in EMPEROR-Reduced and 0.691 in
BIOSTAT-CHF.
When we assessed the observed vs. predicted risk of the composite of HF hospitalization or cardiovascular death and of all-cause
death in the patients in BIOSTAT-CHF by fifths of their risk score distributions, there was a marked gradient in risk, but it was less steep
than predicted by the EMPEROR-Reduced models (Supplementary
material online, Figure S4).
The comparison of the baseline characteristics of the patients
enrolled in EMPEROR-Reduced and BIOSTAT-CHF is displayed in

overlapped, except that BIOSTAT-CHF patients were more symptomatic (proportion in NYHA Class III/IV: 60.5 vs. 24.9), had higher
heart rate (mean b.p.m.: 82 vs. 71), higher NT-proBNP levels (median

Discussion
The biomarker-driven models that we developed and validated
showed good performance for event prediction in patients with
HFrEF. Importantly, these models require only a handful of variables
and can be easily implemented in clinical practice.
Prediction models that incorporate NT-proBNP have been developed for patients with HFrEF.5 However, models that incorporate
both NT-proBNP and hs-cTnT have not been developed to date
among contemporary HFrEF trials. The use of both biomarkers for
event prediction was reported in patients with atrial fibrillation
enrolled in the Apixaban for the Prevention of Stroke in Subjects
With Atrial Fibrillation (ARISTOTLE) trial, where both NT-proBNP
and hs-cTnT were the variables with the strongest association with
cardiovascular death.11 Moreover, in a previous report from
BIOSTAT-CHF, both hs-cTnT and NT-proBNP identified patients at
the risk of cardiovascular death, whereas NT-proBNP (but not hscTnT) identified patients at the risk of death from non-cardiovascular
causes.12
NT-proBNP is the biomarker with the strongest prognostic value
in HF. Elevated levels of NT-proBNP reflect higher filling pressures
and adverse cardiac remodelling and are strongly associated with
severe symptoms and poor health status.13-16 Troponin is cardiacspecific and likely reflects the occurrence of ongoing loss of

recent data have linked hs-cTnT concentrations to cardiac remodelling, where the two biomarkers have a unique correlation, with NTproBNP change preceding that of hs-cTnT.18 This leads to the hypothesis that increased myocardial stress (reflected in NT-proBNP

lowest quintile for each biomarker identifies thresholds previously
identified for risk stratification and cardiac remodelling for both
NT-proBNP and hs-cTnT.18 Given the strong and independent

prognostic value of NT-proBNP and hs-cTnT when evaluated individually, a great potential exists in combining both for refining risk
prediction in HF.
In EMPEROR-Reduced, the utility of the biomarker combination
of NT-proBNP and hs-cTnT was demonstrated by comparing the
event rates of patients in the top third with those in the bottom third
of the distributions of both biomarkers. Those with the highest values
of both biomarkers had an 8.6-fold higher risk of a primary outcome
event and a 6.2-fold higher risk of death than those with the lowest

values of both biomarkers. In addition to elevated NT-proBNP and
hs-cTnT, a recent HF hospitalization, longer HF duration, lower SBP,
NYHA Class III or IV, and peripheral oedema were strongly associated with a subsequent occurrence of a primary outcome event.
These clinical history and physical examination variables have each
been previously shown to predict adverse outcomes in HF. Patients
with a recent HF hospitalization are at higher risk of being re-hospitalized, a risk that inversely related to the time interval since the previous hospitalization, i.e. the shorter the time interval the higher the HF

.. and parsimonious models strongly support the routine assessment of
.. hs-cTnT in the comprehensive assessment of patients with HFrEF.
..
One general problem is that prognostic models of any complexity
..
.. are still used only in a tiny minority of patients with HF. For example,
..
.. several prognostic models for mortality were evaluated in the
.. European Society of Cardiology HF Long-Term Registry, and the
..
.. authors concluded that the performance of prognostic scores is still
.. limited and that physicians are reluctant to use them in daily prac..
.. tice.27 Thus, the need for contemporary, more precise, and simpler
.. prognostic tools, as those here developed and validated.
..
..
.. Limitations
..
.. Some limitations should be highlighted. The primary outcome model
.. could not be fully validated because information about HF duration
..
.. was missing, and information regarding a prior HF hospitalization had
..
.. not been fully recorded in BIOSTAT-CHF. Moreover, in BIOSTAT.. CHF, the gradient in risk was less steep than predicted by the
..
.. EMPEROR-Reduced models, probably because the distribution of
.. log NT-proBNP and log hs-cTnT had a wider standard deviation in
..
.. BIOSTAT-CHF than in EMPEROR-Reduced (1.26 vs. 0.90 for log
.. NT-proBNP and 0.97 vs. 0.67 for log hs-cTnT). Consequently, Cox
..
.. models would be expected to yield smaller HRs per log unit biomark.. er increase when applied to BIOSTAT-CHF than when applied to the
..
.. EMPEROR-Reduced trial. Our risk models are deliberately parsimo.. nious to facilitate their practical use. However, other variables not
..
.. captured in EMPEROR-Reduced, such as frailty, social deprivation, or
.. dementia, could have important prognostic impact. EMPEROR..
.. Reduced had more exclusion criteria than BIOSTAT-CHF, but this
.. did not cause a major impact on the external validity of our models.
..
.. Still, prognostic models derived from a clinical trial database poten..
.. tially have limited generalizability. Thus, we encourage further valid.. ation of our risk models in other populations of HFrEF patients.
..
..
..
.. Conclusion
..
..
.. The combination of NT-proBNP and hs-cTnT with a few readily
..
.. available clinical variables provides a parsimonious prognostic assess.. ment for individual patients with HFrEF. A predictive tool kit based
..
.. on this novel model can be readily implemented for routine clinical

re-hospitalization risk.20 Patients with a long HF duration tend to be
older, present with greater severity of signs and symptoms and
comorbid conditions, independently of age.21 A lower blood pressure is associated with worse prognosis in patients with HFrEF, likely
because it reflects poorer cardiac function.22,23
Signs of congestion (e.g. peripheral oedema) reflect HF decompensation and are strongly associated with HF events.24
Finally, treatment with empagliflozin (rather than placebo) is a
strong primary outcome predictor and hence is included in our risk
score. For future clinical use, this should be presented as 'treatment
with an SGLT2i' since HFrEF trials showed similar benefits for both
empagliflozin and dapagliflozin.25 We have deliberately not included
other non-randomized treatments in our risk models since one cannot reliably distinguish between the actual treatment effect and the
selection process that led to the introduction of each treatment to
some patients and not to others. Thus, the application of our risk
model is best suited to patients receiving appropriate background
treatments for HFrEF, which include inhibitors of the reninangiotensin system and neprilysin, beta-blockers, mineralocorticoid
receptor antagonists, and, when indicated, cardiac devices.
Compared with the composite of HF hospitalization or cardiovascular death, an accurate prediction of all-cause mortality was
achieved with only four variables, i.e. NT-proBNP, hs-cTnT, NYHA
functional Class III or IV, and ischaemic aetiology. Patients with ischaemic heart disease have a higher risk of suffering further myocardial injurious events that accelerate the progression of cardiomyopathy.26
A prognostic model specific for cardiovascular mortality gave very
similar findings to that for all-cause mortality, with NT-proBNP and
hs-cTnT being (by far) the strongest predictors of cardiovascular
mortality, with the former making a slightly greater contribution.
The baseline risk of a patient influences their response to empagliflozin, but this should be assessed both in relative and absolute terms.
Patients in the bottom third of our novel risk score appear to experience a greater magnitude of benefit with empagliflozin on a relative
scale with a 41% primary outcome event rate reduction compared
with a 17% event rate reduction in the top third. However, an inverse
pattern is apparent on an absolute scale where patients in the top
third of the risk score experienced 2.5 times greater absolute event
rate decrease with empagliflozin, when compared with patients at
the bottom third of risk.
Importantly, these biomarker-driven models are simple to use because they rely only on a few readily available variables. Despite their
simplicity, these models perform at least as well, if not better, than far
more complex models with dozens of variables, many of which may
not be easily ascertained from patient records.5 In contrast, NTproBNP and hs-cTnT are available in most clinical settings, although
the former is measured more frequently than the latter in HF
patients. We compared our risk models with others available in the
literature. For the composite of HF hospitalization or cardiovascular
death, we applied the PREDICT-HF risk score (from the
PARADIGM-HF trial), which gave a c-statistic of 0.704. For mortality,
we applied the MAGGIC and the Seattle scores, which gave c-statistics of 0.641 and 0.629, respectively. Notably, when applied to
EMPEROR-Reduced, each of these risk scores performed worse
than the EMPEROR-Reduced scores and was vastly more complex
to compute than the EMPEROR-Reduced risk scores. Our powerful
