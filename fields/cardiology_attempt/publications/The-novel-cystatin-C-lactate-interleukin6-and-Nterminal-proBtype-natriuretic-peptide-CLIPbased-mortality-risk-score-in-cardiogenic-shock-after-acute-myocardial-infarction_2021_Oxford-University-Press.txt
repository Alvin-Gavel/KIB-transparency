Background

Cardiogenic shock (CS) complicating acute myocardial infarction (AMI) still reaches excessively high mortality rates.
This analysis is aimed to develop a new easily applicable biomarker-based risk score.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
A biomarker-based risk score for 30-day mortality was developed from 458 patients with CS complicating AMI
and results
included in the randomized CULPRIT-SHOCK trial. The selection of relevant predictors and the coefficient estima-

tion for the prognostic model were performed by a penalized multivariate logistic regression analysis. Validation
was performed internally, internally externally as well as externally in 163 patients with CS included in the randomized IABP-SHOCK II trial. Blood samples were obtained at randomization. The two trials are registered with
ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01927549 and NCT00491036), are closed to new participants, and follow-up is completed.
Out of 58 candidate variables, the four strongest predictors for 30-day mortality were included in the CLIP score
(cystatin C, lactate, interleukin-6, and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide). The score was well calibrated
and yielded high c-statistics of 0.82 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78-0.86] in internal validation, 0.82 (95% CI
0.75-0.89) in internal-external (temporal) validation, and 0.73 (95% CI 0.65-0.81) in external validation. Notably, it
outperformed the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II and IABP-SHOCK II risk score in prognostication (0.83 vs
0.62; P < 0.001 and 0.83 vs. 0.76; P = 0.03, respectively).

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusions
A biomarker-only score for 30-day mortality risk stratification in infarct-related CS was developed, extensively vali-

dated and calibrated in a prospective cohort of contemporary patients with CS after AMI. The CLIP score outperformed other clinical scores and may be useful as an early decision tool in CS.

Introduction
Cardiogenic shock (CS) is the leading cause of in-hospital death in
acute myocardial infarction (AMI).1 Although early revascularization
by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is considered standard
of care and mechanical circulatory support (MCS) has been used
more frequently in the last years, mortality rates still reach up to
50%.1 Due to the large heterogeneity of the CS population, the individual risk of mortality is highly variable. Currently, decisions around
management of patients presenting with CS involve mostly clinical
acumen, linked to clinical experience of multidisciplinary CS teams-
an approach which is supported to some degree by registry studies
showing improved outcomes.2 Estimation of the individual patient's
prognosis is crucial for further treatment decisions such as more aggressive interventions including MCS or also de-escalation because of
futility. In addition, better risk stratification of populations is required
to conduct clinical studies in CS to tailor more precisely targeted
treatment and to increase comparability of different studies.
Multiple risk scores exist to predict mortality in patients with CS.
However, there is need for multiple input variables including clinical,
angiographic, and biomarker parameters, which reduces their clinical
applicability.3-5 Although these scores can provide mortality risk
stratification, they failed so far to provide meaningful characterization
of CS severity in a way that can be easily communicated between

Based on these considerations, the aim of this analysis was to im..

CULPRIT-SHOCK biomarker substudy in comparison with patients without blood sampling for core laboratory analysis are shown in
Supplementary material online, Table S1. For external validation of the
prediction model, 163 patients from the randomized IABP-SHOCK II trial
with baseline blood samples were available. In this randomized trial, intraaortic balloon pump (IABP) support was compared with no IABP support
in patients with AMI-related CS. There were no significant differences between the two treatment groups with respect to short- and long-term
outcomes.7,8 In both trials, 30-day mortality was among the primary or
secondary outcomes.6,8

Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and heparinized blood as well as
serum were drawn in the catheterization laboratory according to a predefined standardized pre-analytical protocol for processing and storage
during the initial PCI and on the three following days. Samples were centrifuged at 2200 g within 60 min, aliquoted, stored, and shipped at -80 C
to the core laboratory at the University of Leipzig. For a detailed description of the biochemical methods, see Supplementary material online,
Table S2.
Blood sampling in the IABP-SHOCK II population has been reported
previously.9,10 Lactate values were centre-derived and obtained from the
case report form. Cystatin C, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide
(NT-proBNP) and interleukin-6 were analysed from serum and lithiumheparin plasma stored at -80 C in the core laboratory.

Statistical analyses, model development, and
validation
Model development
A detailed description of the statistical methods can be found in the
Supplemental material online. For model development, we considered 30
clinical characteristics as well as 28 blood biomarkers as candidate variables. Numeric variables were transformed by area sinus hyperbolicus to
achieve normal distribution. Due to the high total number of candidate
variables (n = 58), a penalized multivariable logistic regression technique,
Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), was chosen.
Compared with conventional stepwise multivariable regression modelling, this technique enables a more rigid variable selection and is less likely
to overestimate the predictive value.11 For the LASSO regression, the
shrinkage parameter lambda has to be defined. Lambda regulates the
strictness of the model: the higher the value of lambda, the less candidate
variables are included in the model, because more variables are 'penalized' (i.e. excluded). For our final model, lambda was set to yield at least
97% of the predictive power of a model including all 58 candidate variables. Out of all clinical and laboratory candidate variables, the LASSO regression identified those for the most parsimonious risk prediction model
with the highest prognostic performance. This resulted in a final model
with four predictive variables which is a linear function with the following
structure: linear predictor = n th coefficient 1 * variable 1 th coefficient 2
* variable 2 th coefficient 3 * variable 3 th coefficient 4 * variable 4. By
applying inverse logit function to this linear predictor, the score count is
obtained, which is the probability of 30-day mortality between 0 and 1
(multiplied by 100 as percentage). To calculate the relative contribution
to the total predictive performance for each of the four final variables,
the coefficients from the CLIP equation were divided by the respective
standard deviation. Missing values were completed by multiple
imputation.

Model validation, discrimination, and calibration
The model was internally validated using 200 bootstrap samples. For internal-external (temporal) validation the CULPRIT-SHOCK population

.. was non-randomly split by randomization date.12 The same model was
..
.. developed in the earlier two-thirds (n = 306) and validated in the latter
.. third of the population (n = 152). Finally, external validation was per..
.. formed in 163 patients from the IABP-SHOCK II biomarker substudy.7,8
.. A correction term was applied to adjust for the lower mortality of the
..
.. subset available from the IABP-SHOCK II trial (32.5% vs. 40.2% in the
.. whole IABP-SHOCK II biomarker substudy).13 The process of develop..
.. ment and validation of the predictive model is depicted in Figure 1.
..
Discrimination was assessed by the area under the curve (AUC) of re..
.. ceiver operating characteristic analysis (ROC, c-index or c-statistic).
.. Calibration was evaluated using the intercept and slope of the calibration
.. curve showing the relationship between the observed and predicted 30..
.. day mortality. Clinical usefulness was assessed with decision curve ana.. lysis. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to additionally visualize the mortal..
.. ity of the patients stratified by tertiles of predicted mortality. The CLIP
.. score was compared with the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS
..
.. II), the IABP-SHOCK II risk score,4 and the SHOCK trial score14 in terms
.. of discrimination (AUC) by DeLong's method.
..
A multivariable logistic regression was used to study the association of
..
.. 53 clinical and laboratory variables with 30-day mortality adjusted for age,
..
.. renal function, diabetes, sex, body mass index, and revascularization strat.. egy (Supplementary material online, Table S3).
..
..

.. Continuous variables were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test
..
.. and categorical variables were compared using Pearson's v2 test. Baseline
.. characteristics were analysed with SPSSV Statistics 20 (IBM, Armonk, NY,
..
.. USA). All other calculations were performed using R, version 3.4.1. The

Model development and internal
validation
By applying the procedure specified before, the regularization parameter lambda was set to 0.12. Hence, the penalized multivariable logistic regression technique revealed four blood biomarkers, namely
cystatin C, lactate, NT-proBNP, and interleukin-6 to predict 30-day
mortality (Figure 2A and B). The 30-day mortality risk of patients in CS
complicating AMI can be directly calculated from serum blood concentrations of these four biomarkers, with the equation of the CLIP
score (Figure 2C). The relative contribution of each parameter to the
prediction of mortality is depicted in Figure 3.
The internal validation with 200 bootstrap samples of the
CULPRIT-SHOCK cohort (n = 458) revealed a c-index of 0.82 (95%
CI 0.78-0.86). The calibration plot and the decision curve analysis in
the whole CULPRIT-SHOCK population are presented in
Supplementary material online, Figures S1 and S2.

Internal-external (temporal) validation
The same predictive model based on the four blood-based parameters was developed for internal-external (temporal) validation in the
earlier two-thirds of the CULPRIT-SHOCK population (n = 306). In
the later third of the CULPRIT-SHOCK population, it yielded a c-

.. statistics of 0.82 (95% CI 0.75-0.89). The Kaplan-Meier estimated cu..
.. mulative event rate by tertiles of predicted risk is depicted in Figure 4.

.. to decision curve analysis in the internal-external (temporal) valid.. ation cohort can be found in the Supplementary material online. The

.. model was well calibrated and showed large positive net benefit
..

IABP-SHOCK II risk score did not improve the c-statistic compared
with the CLIP score alone [0.81 (95% CI 0.74-0.88) vs. 0.83 (95% CI
0.76-0.90); P = 0.32]. The receiver operator characteristics are
depicted in Figure 5.

Discussion
The major findings of the current analysis are as follows: (i) a novel
blood biomarker-based risk prediction model with the acronym CLIP
score (Cystatin C, Lactate, Interleukin-6, NT-proBNP) was developed, predicting the probability of 30-day mortality of patients with
CS complicating AMI; (ii) the score was extensively validated, and (iii)
outperformed the SAPS II and the IABP-SHOCK II risk score in
prognostication.
In CS, early risk prediction is crucial for the decision-making
regarding further treatment strategies such as the initiation of MCS
or withdrawal of treatment due to futility. Furthermore, correct risk
stratification may be helpful for the design of future clinical studies to
provide more individualized and tailored treatment and to increase
comparability between different trial populations. The mortality risk
scores for CS introduced earlier, share limitations such as small sample size, being developed in the pre-PCI era and/or a lack of strong
validation.14,16-18 In the recent past, two mortality prediction models
developed from large clinical trials/studies have been published.
Harjola et al.3 derived a scoring system from the CardShock study,
which is not specifically related to AMI as aetiology of CS. Our group
introduced a mortality risk score in CS complicated by AMI from the
IABP-SHOCK II trial.4 The CardShock score has been validated in the
IABP-SHOCK II cohort and vice versa. However, both scores include
parameters concerning the patients' past medical history (IABPSHOCK II risk score: history of stroke; CardShock risk score: previous AMI or coronary artery bypass graft surgery). Because of the
emergency setting in which the patients are admitted and due to the
fact that many patients with CS present with impaired mental status
or mechanically ventilated, information on previous diseases is often
lacking. Furthermore, the CardShock risk score includes the clinical

finding of confusion as well as left ventricular ejection fraction; the
IABP-SHOCK II score includes TIMI flow post-PCI. All of these are to
a certain extent subjective variables, limiting the objectivity of these
scores. More recently, the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography
and Interventions (SCAI) classification of CS based on expert consensus has been introduced and validated in two CS cohorts.5,19,20
However, validation depended on subjective clustering of groups as
many variables in the SCAI classification are often not routinely
assessed.5,20 Taken together all previously introduced scores have
multiple limitations and are also based in part on subjective
parameters.
Studies assessing the prognostic value of different non-subjective
biomarkers in CS have been conducted in a single-centre subset of
patients from the IABP-SHOCK II trial9,10,21 as well as in the
CardShock population.22 Rueda et al.23 more recently presented a
proteomic approach for mortality risk estimation in CS from the
CardShock population. Although the study may provide pathophysiologic insights into CS, it has several limitations, such as small sample
size and lack of internal-external and external validation. In addition,
the score is not broadly clinically applicable due to the lack of availability of automated measurement of the four selected non-routine
proteins.
To the best of our knowledge, the CLIP score is the first in CS to
systematically evaluate objective, routinely available as well as novel
biomarkers of mortality prediction in AMI (e.g. copeptin24) and in CS
(e.g. angiopoietin-2,10 growth differentiation factor-15,21 and soluble
ST222). The major strength of the CLIP score is that it includes only
four routinely available biomarkers, which outperformed clinical
parameters as well as novel biomarkers. All of the four biomarkers
are already established on commercial 24/7 laboratory analysers and
should be accessible in dedicated shock centres within a short turnaround time. The availability of in vitro diagnostic-approved commercial test kits and external proficiency testing programmes for the four
biomarkers makes a lab-independent, standardized measurement,
and calculation of the CLIP score feasible. There is no need for considering clinical, PCI-related or anamnestic features and no manual

The dashed line marks the finally selected lambda value of 0.12, with the resulting area under the curve of 0.79, and the coefficients of the four
selected parameters lactate, interleukin-6, N-terminal-pro B-type natriuretic peptide, and cystatin C. Including more variables by selecting a lower
value of lambda (leading to a 'left shift' of the dashed black line) would not substantially improve the model performance (i.e. a relevant increase in
area under the curve). (C) The CLIP score (i.e. the estimated mortality risk) is the inverse logit function of a linear predictor including the areasinus

scoring must be conducted, leading to a high objectivity of the score
(Graphical abstract).
The four biomarkers are all involved in the complex pathophysiology of CS. As previously reported, lactate as a determinant of global tissue hypoxaemia was the strongest predictor. The second
relevant prognosticator, NT-proBNP, has been widely implemented
as a marker of cardiac wall stress in congestive heart failure.25 Its
prognostic relevance in CS has been shown in smaller studies before.22 In addition, it is pathophysiologically plausible that a stronger
degree of heart failure is associated with higher mortality. Thirdly, the
proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 was a significant determinant

of prognosis. This is in line with previous findings showing that systemic inflammation plays a key role in the pathophysiology of CS.26
The fourth contributing factor in the predictive model is cystatin C.
Parameters of renal function have been previously described to have
prognostic relevance in CS and are included in the IABP-SHOCK II
and in the CardShock risk score.3,4 Contrary to our results, creatinine
was superior over cystatin C for mortality prediction in the IABPSHOCK II biomarker population.9 However, our results are in
line with previous findings from large studies showing the prognostic
superiority of cystatin C over creatinine in a general population
meta-analysis and in patients presenting with acute coronary

CLIP score to mortality prediction. The coefficients from the model
equation are divided by the standard deviation of their respective
biomarkers. Thus, the contribution of each biomarker can be comparatively evaluated independently of its variance. As an example,
one standard deviation change in the blood level of lactate affects
the prediction twice more than one standard deviation change in
the interleukin-6 blood level. NT-proBNP, N-terminal pro-B-type

syndromes.27,28 Cystatin C may have a higher diagnostic accuracy
than creatinine because it is less affected by muscle mass.
Furthermore, cystatin C may be involved in inflammatory responses,
e.g. by altering the response of macrophages to interferon-gamma.29
This might partly explain its strong predictive power in the setting of
CS.
The CLIP score might also be helpful for clinical decision-making
regarding the selection of management strategies (e.g. whether or
not to initiate MCS or to withdraw therapy due to futility). However,
calculation of a score cannot be the only variable determining such
far-reaching decisions, which must take into account many other

Conclusion
The new CLIP predictive model in patients with CS complicating
AMI, including only four well established blood-based biomarkers
(cystatin C, lactate, interleukin-6, and NT-proBNP) can be rapidly
and automatically calculated and is therefore easy to implement in
clinical practice. It may serve as a tool for risk stratification of CS
patients and may thus be helpful for clinical decision-making and for
the design of future clinical trials.
