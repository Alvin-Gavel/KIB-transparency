Aims

Patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) frequently have difficult-to-control hypertension.
We examined the effect of neprilysin inhibition on 'apparent resistant hypertension' in patients with HFpEF in the
PARAGON-HF trial, which compared the effect of sacubitril-valsartan with valsartan.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
In this post hoc analysis, patients were categorized according to systolic blood pressure at the end of the valand results
sartan run-in (n = 4795). 'Apparent resistant hypertension' was defined as systolic blood pressure >_140 mmHg
(>_135 mmHg if diabetes) despite treatment with valsartan, a calcium channel blocker, and a diuretic. 'Apparent
mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA)-resistant' hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure
>_140 mmHg (>_135 mmHg if diabetes) despite the above treatments and an MRA. The primary outcome in the
PARAGON-HF trial was a composite of total hospitalizations for heart failure and death from cardiovascular
causes. We examined clinical endpoints and the safety of sacubitril-valsartan according to the hypertension
category. We also examined reductions in blood pressure from the end of valsartan run-in to Weeks 4 and 16
after randomization. Overall, 731 patients (15.2%) had apparent resistant hypertension and 135 (2.8%) had apparent MRA-resistant hypertension. The rate of the primary outcome was higher in patients with apparent resistant hypertension [17.3; 95% confidence interval (CI) 15.6-19.1 per 100 person-years] compared to those
with a controlled systolic blood pressure (13.4; 12.7-14.3 per 100 person-years), with an adjusted rate ratio

of 1.28 (95% CI 1.05-1.57). The reduction in systolic blood pressure at Weeks 4 and 16, respectively, was
greater with sacubitril-valsartan vs. valsartan in patients with apparent resistant hypertension [-4.8 (-7.0 to
-2.5) and 3.9 (-6.6 to -1.3) mmHg] and apparent MRA-resistant hypertension [-8.8 (-14.0 to -3.5) and -6.3
(-12.5 to -0.1) mmHg]. The proportion of patients with apparent resistant hypertension achieving a controlled
systolic blood pressure by Week 16 was 47.9% in the sacubitril-valsartan group and 34.3% in the valsartan
group [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.78, 95% CI 1.30-2.43]. In patients with apparent MRA-resistant hypertension, the respective proportions were 43.6% vs. 28.4% (adjusted OR 2.63, 95% CI 1.18-5.89).

Graphical Abstract

Almost one in six patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction had apparent resistant hypertension in PARAGON-HF and this was associated
with worse clinical outcomes; neprilysin inhibition reduced systolic blood pressure significantly in these patients.

access to patient-level data and supporting clinical documents from eligible studies. These requests are reviewed and approved by an independent review panel, based on scientific merit. All data provided are
anonymized to respect the privacy of patients who have participated in
the trial in line with applicable laws and regulations. The criteria and process for obtaining trial data are described at www.clinicalstudydatare
quest.com (last accessed 24 July 2021).

Study patients
The trial eligibility criteria included New York Heart Association
(NYHA) functional Class II-IV, a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)
of 45% or higher, an elevated natriuretic peptide concentration (with the
level varying according to whether or not there had been a recent hospitalization for heart failure and the presence or absence of atrial fibrillation
or flutter), evidence of structural heart disease, and treatment with a diuretic. Exclusion criteria included systolic blood pressure >180 mmHg; in
addition, patients with a systolic blood pressure >150-180 mmHg were
excluded unless receiving at least three antihypertensive drugs. Other exclusion criteria at screening included systolic blood pressure
<110 mmHg, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <30 mL/min/
1.73 m2, and serum potassium >5.2 mmol/L.

Study treatment
Patients entered two sequential single-blind run-in periods, first receiving
valsartan 80 mg twice daily (i.e. half the target dose for heart failure and
half the maximum recommended dose for hypertension) for 1-2 weeks
and then sacubitril-valsartan 49/51 mg twice daily for 2-4 weeks. Patients
had to be free of symptoms of hypotension and have a systolic blood
pressure of at least 100 mmHg to progress through each step of the runin and to randomization. Participants were then randomized 1:1 to treatment with either sacubitril-valsartan (target dose 97/103 mg twice daily)
or valsartan (target dose 160 mg twice daily). Valsartan 103 mg in sacubitril-valsartan gives plasma exposure equivalent to 160 mg of the standard
valsartan formulation (and 51 mg the same as 80 mg).

Blood pressure measurement
Investigators were asked to measure blood pressure in the sitting position after 5 min of rest using an automated, validated device (e.g.
OMRON) or a standard sphygmomanometer with an appropriately sized
cuff on the non-dominant arm. Investigators were also asked to ensure
patients had not taken caffeine or smoked within the 30 min preceding
the blood pressure measurement and that the measurement was made in
a quiet room, with the patient comfortably seated, back resting against
their chair.

Trial outcomes
The median follow-up duration in the PARAGON-HF trial was
35 months [interquartile range (IQR) 30-41]. The primary outcome was
a composite of first and recurrent hospitalizations for heart failure and
death from cardiovascular causes. Secondary outcomes included in this
study were the time to the first occurrence of a decline in renal function
(defined as a reduction of 50% of more in eGFR, development of endstage renal disease or death due to renal failure) and time to death from
any cause. We also examined the prespecified exploratory composite of
cardiovascular death, total non-fatal heart failure hospitalizations, total
non-fatal strokes and total non-fatal myocardial infarctions. Safety outcomes analysed were hypotension (systolic blood pressure
<100 mmHg), elevation of serum creatinine, and elevation of serum potassium. Because sacubitril-valsartan did not reduce the risk of the primary outcome in the trial overall, the effect of randomized therapy on
clinical outcomes was not analysed in the hypertension subgroups.

have hypertension that is difficult to control, despite use of multiple
antihypertensive agents. Indeed, it appears that 'resistant hypertension' is as common in patients with HFpEF as in individuals with
hypertension more generally, with 10-20% of patients affected.6,7
Resistant hypertension is formally defined as blood pressure persistently above target, despite the use of three antihypertensive agents
of different classes, including an angiotensin-converting enzyme
(ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), a calcium
channel blocker, and a diuretic, although there is some variation between USA and European guidelines.8,9
Neprilysin inhibition offers an additional approach to reducing
blood pressure. Indeed, the first clinical trial using the combined
angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor, sacubitril-valsartan, was
conducted in patients with uncomplicated mild-to-moderate hypertension.10 Sacubitril-valsartan 194/206 mg (LCZ696 200 mg) once
daily was compared with valsartan 320 mg once daily (the doses
selected gave equivalent plasma exposure of valsartan, due to greater
bioavailability with the combination drug). After 8 weeks of treatment, sitting systolic pressure was reduced by 6.01 [95% confidence
interval (CI) -9.01 to -3.02] mmHg with sacubitril-valsartan, compared with valsartan (P < 0.0001). Sacubitril-valsartan was subsequently developed as a treatment for heart failure using a twice
rather than once daily dosing regimen. In the first study of this agent
in patients with HFpEF, sacubitril-valsartan 97/103 mg twice daily was
compared to valsartan 160 mg twice daily in a phase 2 randomized
trial of 266 patients.11 Although change in blood pressure was not
the primary endpoint, this trial showed that, after 12 weeks of treatment, sacubitril-valsartan reduced systolic pressure by 6.4 mmHg,
compared with valsartan (P = 0.001). The same treatment regimens
were then compared in a phase 3 morbidity/mortality trial in patients
with HFpEF, the Prospective Comparison of ARNI With ARB Global
Outcomes in Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction trial
(PARAGON-HF).12 Although not a hypertension trial, >95% of
patients in PARAGON-HF had a history of hypertension and, overall,
sacubitril-valsartan reduced systolic pressure by 5.2 (4.4-6.0) mmHg
compared with valsartan after 4 weeks.13 However, the effect of
sacubitril-valsartan in resistant hypertension is of special interest,
given the difficulty of controlling blood pressure in these patients and
the need for new treatments.14
The large PARAGON-HF dataset allowed post hoc exploration of
the prevalence of 'apparent resistant hypertension', the association
between 'apparent resistant hypertension' and outcomes in HFpEF,
and the effect of neprilysin inhibition on blood pressure in these
patients. We studied blood pressure control in individuals receiving
all three recommended classes of antihypertensive therapy. We also
examined a further group of patients with 'apparent mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA)-resistant hypertension' receiving, in
addition, an MRA, which has recently become the preferred fourthline agent as a result of the PATHWAY-2 trial.15

A total of 4796 patients were randomized in the PARAGON-HF trial.
Inclusion, definitions, and outcomes analysed in this study are summarized
in Supplementary material online, Figure SI. In this study, the primary definition of 'apparent resistant hypertension' was a systolic blood pressure
>_140 mmHg (>_135 mmHg in those with diabetes) at the end of the valsartan run-in, despite concomitant treatment with a calcium channel
blocker and diuretic (thiazide or thiazide-like, loop, or potassium-sparing
other than an MRA), as well as valsartan.12,16,17 Concomitant medications
were at the start of the run-in period, i.e. prior to the visit at which the patient was defined as having resistant hypertension. An alternative definition was also used in supplementary analyses: systolic blood pressure
>_130 mmHg at the end of valsartan run-in despite concomitant treatment with a calcium channel blocker and diuretic, as well as valsartan,
reflecting the American Heart Association recommendations.8 Finally, we
also examined patients with more refractory, 'apparent MRA-resistant'
hypertension, defined as: systolic blood pressure >_140 mmHg
(>_135 mmHg in those with diabetes) at the end of valsartan run-in, despite concomitant treatment with a calcium channel blocker, diuretic and
an MRA, as well as valsartan (i.e. at least four classes of blood pressurelowering therapy, including an MRA). Other patients were considered to
have non-resistant hypertension if systolic blood pressure remained
above the respective thresholds, but the definition of apparent resistant
hypertension was not fulfilled (i.e. patients were not on the specified
blood pressure-lowering drug combination) and considered to have a
'controlled blood pressure' if systolic blood pressure was below the respective thresholds at the end of the valsartan run-in (irrespective of concomitant medications and accepting that many of these patients had
effectively treated hypertension). Baseline characteristics were compared
using t-tests, ANOVA, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, and v2 tests where appropriate. Reduction in systolic blood pressure from the end of the valsartan run-in to Weeks 4 and 16 after randomization, on sacubitril-
valsartan vs. valsartan, was analysed using a mixed model for repeated
measures (including all values up to Week 16, including baseline value and
interaction of treatment and visit with a random intercept and slope per
patient), and the between treatment group differences at Week 16 following randomization were presented as least square means difference
and 95% CI. In the event of death prior to Week 16, blood pressure
measurements were included up until the time at which the death
occurred and were recorded as missing thereafter. The proportion of
patients with controlled systolic blood pressure at 16 weeks, defined as
reduction in systolic blood pressure to below 140 mmHg in patients without diabetes and to below 135 mmHg in patients with diabetes (and as a
reduction in systolic blood pressure to below 130 mmHg using the alternative definition of apparent resistant hypertension), was examined and
the odds of a reduction were estimated using logistic regression. The primary composite outcome and one of its components, total heart failure
hospitalizations, were examined using a semiparametric proportional
rates method.18 Cardiovascular death, all-cause death, and the renal outcome were examined using Cox proportional hazards regression.
Cumulative first events were displayed using Kaplan-Meier curves. The
Nelson-Aalen non-parametric estimator for cumulative hazard rate function, which accounts for patients who are censored due to competing
events (i.e. cardiovascular death), was used to display the hazard of recurrent events. The proportional hazards assumptions were checked and
met for all models. All models examining the primary and secondary trial
outcomes included randomized treatment and were stratified by region.
The multivariable models for the primary and secondary trial outcomes
also included sex, age, heart rate, body mass index, N-terminal pro-Btype natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) (log), NYHA class, LVEF, eGFR,
prior hospitalization for heart failure, myocardial infarction, diabetes,

Patients with apparent MRA-resistant hypertension were younger,
had a higher body mass index, lower natriuretic peptide level, and
more often had a diabetes than patients with a controlled blood pressure (Supplementary material online, Table SII). Patients with apparent MRA-resistant hypertension were more often treated with a
diuretic, calcium channel blocker and alpha-blocker than those with a
controlled blood pressure.

The rate of the primary composite outcome was higher in
patients with apparent resistant hypertension (17.3; 95% CI 15.6-
19.1 per 100 person-years) compared to those with a controlled
blood pressure (13.4; 12.7-14.3 per 100 person-years), with
an adjusted rate ratio of 1.28 (95% CI 1.05-1.57) (Table 2 and
Figure 1). The greater risk of the primary composite outcome in

Table 2

patients with apparent resistant hypertension was driven by a
higher rate of heart failure hospitalization whereas the risk of
death from cardiovascular causes (and from any cause) was not
different between these groups.
The rate of the prespecified exploratory composite outcome of
cardiovascular death, total heart failure hospitalizations, total strokes,
and total myocardial infarctions was also higher in patients with
apparent resistant hypertension (20.8; 95% CI 19.0-22.8 per 100
person-years) compared to those with a controlled blood pressure
(16.3; 95% CI 15.4-17.2 per 100 person-years), with an adjusted rate
ratio of 1.30 (95% CI 1.08-1.55).
The risk of the composite renal outcome was significantly higher in
patients with apparent resistant hypertension (1.2; 95% CI 0.8-1.7
per 100 person-years) compared to those with a controlled blood
pressure (0.6; 95% CI 0.4-0.8 per 100 person-years), with an adjusted
rate ratio of 1.72 (95% CI 1.04-2.86).

The rate of all the outcomes of interest was similar in patients

A broadly similar pattern was seen using the alternative definition
of apparent resistant hypertension (Supplementary material online,

precluded formal analysis of outcomes (Supplementary material
online, Table SIV and Figure SIII).

the valsartan 80 mg b.i.d. run-in period (Table 3 and Figure 2).
As a result, systolic blood pressure was reduced more by sacubitril-
valsartan (97/103 mg b.i.d.) than by valsartan (160 mg b.i.d.) at both 4
and 16 weeks after randomization, compared to the end of valsartan
run-in, in patients with apparent resistant hypertension (Table 3 and
Figure 2), with differences between the treatment groups of -4.8 (-7.0

In patients with apparent MRA-resistant hypertension, the
absolute reduction in systolic blood pressure was also larger with
sacubitril-valsartan, compared with valsartan: -8.8 (-14.0 to -3.5)
mmHg and -6.3 (-12.5 to -0.1) mmHg at Weeks 4 and 16, respectively (Table 3 and Figure 2).

(47.9%) than in those assigned to valsartan (34.3%), with an adjusted
odds ratio (OR) of 1.78 (95% CI 1.30-2.43) (Table 3).

with apparent MRA-resistant hypertension (43.6% vs. 28.4%), with
an adjusted OR of 2.63 (95% CI 1.18-5.89).

Safety and tolerability of sacubitril-
valsartan in patients with resistant
hypertension
Hypotension was more common with sacubitril-valsartan than with
valsartan, although the excess in patients with apparent resistant
hypertension was small (Table 4). Conversely, elevation of serum creatinine and potassium was less common with sacubitril-valsartan
than with valsartan, in patients with apparent resistant hypertension.
The pattern of adverse events was broadly similar using the alternative definition of apparent resistant hypertension and in those with
apparent MRA-resistant hypertension (Supplementary material online, Tables SV and SVI).

Discussion
As defined in this study, 'apparent resistant hypertension' was common in patients with HFpEF, affecting 15% of all individuals at the end
of the valsartan run-in period in PARAGON-HF (and 37% of those
whose systolic blood pressure remained elevated at that time point).

Patients with 'apparent resistant hypertension', as defined in this
study, had a greater risk of the primary composite of hospitalization
for heart failure and cardiovascular death and the prespecified exploratory composite of hospitalization for heart failure, myocardial
infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death. When added to an ARB
(valsartan), a calcium channel blocker, and a diuretic (and even to
these three agents plus an MRA), neprilysin inhibition lowered systolic blood pressure significantly and increased the proportion of
patients with controlled hypertension (Graphical abstract). Given the
overall safety profile of sacubitril-valsartan, compared with valsartan,
and better renal function, switching from an ACE inhibitor or ARB to
sacubitril-valsartan may offer an effective and safe approach to controlling resistant hypertension in patients with HFpEF. This possibility
merits further investigation in prospective hypertension trial with a
more rigorous definition of resistant hypertension.
Although HFpEF is widely recognized as a hypertensive phenotype,
little is known about the prevalence of hypertension in HFpEF and
how best to lower blood pressure in patients with this syndrome.1-5
In a pooled analysis (n = 8466) of the three largest morbidity/mortality trials in HFpEF before PARAGON-HF, 46% of participants had a
systolic blood pressure >_140 mmHg (or >_135 mmHg in individuals
with diabetes) and 70% a systolic blood pressure >_130 mmHg, indicating that hypertension remains a highly prevalent and sub-optimally
treated problem in these patients.19 In terms of therapy, diuretics
are often needed to control sodium and water retention in HFpEF,
making them a first-line treatment for comorbid hypertension. While
ARBs did not improve HFpEF outcomes in two large randomized

antihypertensive action of neprilysin inhibition on top of an MRA
could be of considerable clinical importance, if confirmed. This
benefit is likely to reflect the complementary and additive mechanisms of action of the two drugs, with spironolactone treating sodium and water retention and neprilysin inhibition augmenting
natriuretic and other vasodilator peptides (e.g. adrenomedullin),
as well as possibly reducing sympathetic activation.29 The elevation in natriuretic peptides may be particularly relevant in this patient subgroup who had the lowest baseline levels of these
peptides, probably reflecting the high prevalence of obesity in
these patients.30-32 In addition to more effective blood pressure
lowering, sacubitril-valsartan reduces arterial stiffness and left
ventricular mass more than an ARB, other actions likely to be
valuable in patients with HFpEF.33,34
Importantly, the renal safety profile of sacubitril-valsartan in this
study was favourable, irrespective of the definition of resistant hypertension used. In fact, elevation of serum creatinine and potassium
generally occurred less frequently in patients with apparent resistant
hypertension taking sacubitril-valsartan than it did in those taking valsartan. This is particularly important in patients taking both an ARB
and MRA, where the risk of decline in renal function and/or hyperkalaemia is accentuated.35,36
Examining clinical outcomes, it was of interest that patents with
'non-resistant' hypertension were at lower risk than patients with 'apparent resistant hypertension', despite a similar baseline systolic
blood pressure and, in fact, had a risk similar to patients with a controlled blood pressure. The greater risk of the primary composite
outcome seen for patients with 'apparent resistant hypertension' was
driven predominantly by heart failure hospitalization, consistent with
heart failure being a blood pressure sensitive endpoint in hypertension trials. We do not know what the explanation for this is, although
our data suggest several possibilities. The prevalence of obesity was
higher in the 'apparent resistant hypertension' group, compared with
both the 'non-resistant' hypertension and controlled blood pressure
groups (who had a similar prevalence of obesity) and more obese
HFpEF patients have higher heart failure hospitalization rates.37
Baseline use of an MRA was lowest in patients with apparent resistant
hypertension and highest in those with a controlled blood pressure
group, and MRA therapy may reduce the risk of heart failure hospitalization in HFpEF.23 Conversely, the use of alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists was much higher among patients with apparent resistant
hypertension than in the other groups, and alpha-blockers increase
the risk of heart failure hospitalization in patients with hypertension.25
It is possible that there were other differences between these groups
for which we did not have data. For example, patients with apparent
resistant hypertension may have had a longer history of disease, a longer time sub-optimally treated in the early course of their disease, unidentified end-organ damage, or differences in diurnal blood pressure
profile.
Two additional observations are worthy of comment, although are
not based on randomized comparisons. First, the decline in systolic
blood pressure after switching from valsartan 80 mg b.i.d. to sacubitril-valsartan 49/51 mg b.i.d. (i.e. from the first to the second consecutive run-in period) seemed to be larger than the blood pressure
difference between valsartan 80 and 160 mg b.i.d. However, systolic
pressure did appear to decrease with 160 mg b.i.d. of valsartan compared to 80 mg b.i.d. of valsartan.

controlled morbidity/mortality trials,20,21 these studies did not raise
safety concerns and ARBs are, therefore, another useful antihypertensive therapy in HFpEF. The same is true of spironolactone.22
Thereafter, evidence is lacking. There is no large randomized
placebo-controlled experience with beta-blockers, with only 314
patients with an LVEF >_50% enrolled in the landmark trials, and a recent analysis of non-randomized beta-blocker use in TOPCAT
showed that this treatment was associated with a higher risk of heart
failure hospitalization in patients with an LVEF >_50%.23,24
Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers cause peripheral oedema
and heart failure to develop significantly more often in hypertensive
patients treated with alpha-adrenoceptor blockers than with other
blood pressure-lowering drugs.25 Indeed, in the setting of increased
pulmonary blood flow, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers can
cause pulmonary oedema as a result of pre-capillary vasodilation in
the pulmonary circulation, and it is of interest that the two blood
pressure groups with the highest rates of use of calcium channel
blockers (controlled blood pressure and apparent resistant hypertension) had the highest rates of heart failure hospitalization in the
present study.26 The possibility that neprilysin inhibition might be an
effective, as well as safe, blood pressure-reducing therapy in HFpEF
suggests that this approach may be a valuable addition to the antihypertensive options available for these patients (and consistent with
early studies of sacubitril and sacubitril-valsartan in patients with uncomplicated hypertension, including elderly individuals who comprise
the majority of people with HFpEF).10,13,27,28
However, the focus of the current report is 'apparent resistant
hypertension', and neprilysin inhibition also reduced blood pressure
in patients remaining hypertensive despite treatment with the recommended combination of an ARB, a calcium channel blocker, and a diuretic; indeed, 77% of these patients were also treated with a betablocker and 13% with an alpha-blocker. Spironolactone has also been
shown to reduce blood pressure in HFpEF patients with resistant
hypertension. Specifically, in TOPCAT, 403 HFpEF patients (23%)
enrolled in the Americas had 'resistant hypertension', defined as a
systolic blood pressure between 140 and 160 mmHg, despite treatment with three or more antihypertensive medications.6 After
4 months, systolic blood pressure was reduced by 5.53 (standard
error 1.95) mmHg with spironolactone compared with placebo, in
keeping with the superior blood pressure reduction exhibited with
spironolactone, compared with other treatments, in patients with resistant hypertension in the PATHWAY-2 trial.15 In TOPCAT, spironolactone also increased the proportion of patients achieving blood
pressure control significantly (OR 1.77, 95% CI 1.16-2.69).6 In our
analysis of the 731 patients in PARAGON-HF qualifying because of a
similar blood pressure threshold, neprilysin inhibition reduced systolic blood pressure by 3.9 (-6.6 to -1.3) mmHg at 4 months. Neprilysin
inhibition also increased the proportion of patients with a controlled
blood pressure significantly (OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.30-2.43). More importantly, neprilysin inhibition also reduced systolic blood pressure
[by 6.3 (-12.5 to -0.1) mmHg] in the 135 patients treated with an
MRA in addition to an ARB, a calcium channel blocker, and a diuretic
(i.e. with at least four drugs), resulting in a more than doubling of the
proportion of patients attaining blood pressure control with neprilysin inhibition (OR 2.63, 95% CI 1.18-5.89). Given the superior efficacy of spironolactone as a treatment for resistant hypertension, and
the high risk faced by these patients, we believe that this incremental

This study had some limitations. Certain patients were excluded
from PARAGON-HF including those with a systolic blood pressure
>180 mmHg and an eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2. Similarly, patients
with a systolic blood pressure of >150 and <180 mmHg were only
eligible for enrolment if receiving at least three antihypertensive
agents, which may have increased the proportion of patients who fulfilled the definition of apparent resistant hypertension in this study.
Blood pressure measured at trial follow-up visits was not standardized and repeated in the same way as in dedicated hypertension trials and we did not perform ambulatory blood pressure monitoring
or out-of-office measurements, which would be required to confirm
true resistant hypertension. We did not have information on treatment adherence or time between administration of antihypertensive
medication and measurements of blood pressure, but drug adherence in patients with heart failure has previously been found to be
much better than in people with hypertension.38-40 Because of the
way we measured blood pressure, because we did not know the
doses of all classes of blood pressure-lowering drugs or whether
these were at maximally tolerated doses, and because we could not
confirm adherence, we could not exclude pseudo-resistance; therefore, the term 'apparent resistant hypertension' was used to describe
this group, although the proportion of patients in this category was
consistent with other studies of patients classified as having resistant
hypertension. Also, as our trial had sequential run-in periods, the
patients randomized to valsartan 160 mg b.i.d. had just discontinued
sacubitril-valsartan 49/51 mg b.i.d. As the effect of sacubitril-valsartan
was borderline statistical significance in the overall trial, we did not
have the power to examine the effect of sacubitril-valsartan in each
hypertension subgroup.
In summary, we have examined the efficacy and safety of sacubitril-valsartan in treating apparent resistant hypertension in patients
with HFpEF, when compared with valsartan alone. Our findings suggest that sacubitril-valsartan is effective in reducing blood pressure
not only in patients with apparent resistant hypertension but also in
those who have more refractory, or apparent MRA-resistant hypertension, with an elevated systolic blood pressure despite treatment
with at least four antihypertensive drug classes, including an MRA.
