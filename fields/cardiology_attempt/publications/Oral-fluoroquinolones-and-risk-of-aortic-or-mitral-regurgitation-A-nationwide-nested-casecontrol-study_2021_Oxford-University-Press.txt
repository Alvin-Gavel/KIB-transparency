Aims

Reports have suggested an increased risk of aortic and mitral regurgitation associated with oral fluoroquinolones
(FQs) resulting in a safety warning published by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). However, these findings
have not yet been replicated.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods and
Using Danish administrative registers, we conducted a nested case-control study in a nationwide cohort of individuresults
als between 2005 and 2018. Cases were defined as the first occurrence of aortic or mitral regurgitation. Exposure
of interest was the use of oral FQs. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were obtained by
fitting time-dependent Cox regression models, with penicillin V as comparator, to assess the association between
FQ use and incident valvular regurgitation. We identified 38 370 cases of valvular regurgitation with 1 115 100
matched controls. FQ exposure was not significantly associated with increased rates of aortic or mitral regurgitation (HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.95-1.09) compared with penicillin V users. Investigating the cumulative defined daily doses
(cDDD) of FQs yielded similar results with no significant association between increasing FQ use and valvular regurgitation (e.g. HR 1.08, 95% CI 0.95-1.23 for cDDD >10 compared with cDDD 1-5). These results were consistent
across several analyses including a cohort of patients with hypertension and using a case definition based on valvular surgical interventions.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusions
In a nationwide nested case-control study, FQs were not significantly associated with increased rates of valvular regurgitation. Our findings do not support a possible causal connection between FQ exposure and incident valvular
regurgitation.

Introduction
Fluoroquinolones (FQs) are a class of widely used antimicrobial
agents with broad-spectrum activity against both gram-negative and
gram-positive bacteria.1,2 While being generally well-tolerated, the
use of FQs is associated with adverse reactions related to several
organ systems.3 FQs are among the most commonly prescribed antibiotics worldwide, thus potential adverse effects are of significant
public health importance.4
Studies have indicated that FQs cause degradation of collagen and
extracellular matrix potentially increasing the risk of tendinopathy, aortic aneurysms, and aortic dissections.5-8 Furthermore, it has been suggested that FQ-induced collagen degradation could potentially affect
the valves of the heart leading to valvular regurgitation.9 A recent study
substantiated this claim with the finding of an increased risk of aortic
and mitral valve regurgitation in patients treated with FQs.10
Consequently, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) published a
safety concern against the use of FQs, especially in patient populations
considered at high risk of regurgitant valvular heart disease (e.g. patients
with hypertension or connective tissue disorders).11 However, the data
underlying the EMA warning were based on one experimental study
and one observational study and have yet to be reproduced.
Accordingly, using nationwide Danish administrative registers, we
sought to investigate if the use of FQs was associated with increased

..
.. rates of incident aortic or mitral regurgitation in a nationwide cohort
.. of adults as well as in a high-risk population of patients with
..
.. hypertension.

Background, study design, methods, and main results of the present study investigating oral fluoroquionolones and risk of aortic or mitral regurgitation.

Fluoroquinolones and the risk of valve regurgitation

Study population, design, and case definition

Exposure and variables of interest
The primary exposure of interest was prescriptions of oral FQs (ciprofloxacin or moxifloxacin) defined as any filled prescription within 1 year
prior to the date of interest (date of aortic or mitral regurgitation for
cases or corresponding date for controls). The included drugs were the
formulations of FQs available for oral treatment in the study period in
Denmark. Supplementary definitions of FQ exposure were defined as
any filled prescription within 30 and 90 days prior to the date of interest
to assess any short-term association between FQ use and valvular regurgitation. For the analysis of surgical interventions, we used time windows
of 1 and 3 years prior to the case date for defining exposure. To help interpretation, we reported proportions of patients in the cohorts redeeming at least 1, 2, 3, or 4 FQ prescriptions within 5 years from inclusion.
To estimate a potential dose-response relationship, we calculated the
cumulative defined daily doses (cDDD) of FQs based on all filled FQ prescriptions within 3 years prior to the date of interest, as we would expect
any association between FQ and valvular degradation to become stronger with increased exposure to FQ. The DDD is the assumed daily dose
of a drug as defined by the World Health Organization.19 Thus, the

.. cDDD of FQs was the sum of all consumed daily doses within 3 years
..
.. prior to the date of interest. The DDD for ciprofloxacin is 1 g and the
.. DDD for moxifloxacin is 0.4 g. The cDDD of FQ was divided into the fol..
.. lowing categories: cDDD 1-5, cDDD 6-10, and cDDD >10 based on
.. the cDDD distributions.
..
To minimize the risk of protopathic bias, we used an active compara..
.. tor design in which the non-exposed included in the analyses had to be
.. exposed to a comparable class of antibiotic drugs.20,21 Since valvular heart
..
.. disease often presents with dyspnoea as the primary symptom, reverse
.. causality could be feared as FQs could be prescribed for suspected pneu..
.. monia in patients with yet undiagnosed valvular regurgitation.
.. Accordingly, the non-exposed individuals included in the main analysis
.. had to be exposed to penicillin V, which is the first-line treatment for
..
.. community-acquired pneumonia in Denmark.22,23
..
Comorbidities were defined as any primary or secondary diagnosis
..
.. registered in a period of 5 years prior to the date of interest. We included
.. the following comorbidities: ischaemic heart disease, congestive heart fail..
.. ure, atrial fibrillation, prior ischaemic stroke or transient cerebral ischae.. mia, chronic kidney disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
.. (COPD) (Supplementary material online, Table S1).
..
..
Concomitant pharmacotherapy was defined as filled prescriptions for
.. drugs of interest in a period of 180 days prior to the date of interest.
..
.. Pharmacotherapy deemed relevant to the current study was treatment
.. with beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, renin-angiotensin system
.. inhibitors, anticoagulants, antiplatelet drugs, statins, loop diuretics, and
..
.. non-loop diuretics.
..
Diabetes mellitus was defined as filled prescriptions for glucose-lower..
.. ing drugs (Supplementary material online, Table S1).
..
..
.. Statistical methodology
.. The study population in question was described as cases and controls
..
.. using descriptive statistics with continuous variables summarized by
.. medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) and categorical variables by
.. counts and percentages. Moreover, the cohorts (the overall population
..
.. nest and the hypertension nest) were described and characterized at
.. baseline.
..
..
The nested case-control design was applied to estimate the association
.. between FQ exposure and the rates of incident valvular regurgitation
..
.. using a time-dependent Cox proportional hazards regression model.
.. Using conditional logistic regression software, the model was fitted to the
.. nested case-control data providing hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confi..
.. dence intervals (95% CI).24,25
..
Furthermore, we performed an analysis investigating a potential dose-
..
.. response relationship, using cDDD quantiles of FQs as the exposure of
.. interest using the group with the shortest FQ exposure (1-5 cDDD) as a
..
.. reference, thus comparing patients with prolonged FQ exposure with
.. patients having a more limited exposure to FQs.
..
In order to characterize overall FQ use during the study period,
..
.. redemptions of FQ prescriptions were analysed as a recurrent event
.. using appropriate methods to handle the loss of follow-up (i.e. censoring)
..
.. and the competing risk of death.26
..
All models were adjusted for pre-specified confounders (ischaemic
..
.. heart disease, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, COPD, diabetes mellitus, and
.. chronic kidney disease. Additionally, the hypertension cohort was
.. adjusted for age).
..
..
To avoid collider bias, the potential confounders were only included in
.. the adjusted model if occurring in the time period 5 years prior to the
..
.. earliest date of possible exposure (1 year prior to case/control date for
.. the main analysis and 90 days prior to case/control date in the 90-day ex.. posure analysis, etc.).27 Pertaining to the nested case-control design, the
..
. reported HRs should be interpreted as the estimates of a Cox model

The main analyses of the study were conducted as nationwide nested
case-control studies in the period between 2005 and 2018.18 Individuals
were excluded at baseline if they had prior registrations of regurgitant
valvular disease (diagnoses or procedural codes as elaborated later),
prosthetic heart valves, known connective tissue disorders (Marfan syndrome, rheumatic fever, rheumatoid arthritis, and Bechterew's disease),
or previous infective endocarditis. Eligible individuals between 30 and
100 years of age were included between 2005 and 2018.
We pre-planned several complementary analyses to ensure the robustness of estimates considering the definition and timing of outcomes and
selected subpopulations included in the EMA warning. Firstly, cases were
defined as the first event of a diagnostic code of either aortic or mitral regurgitation during the study period in order to employ a sensitive case definition (i.e. to capture as many cases as possible). Secondly, in order to only
capture patients with clinically significant valvular regurgitation, we performed an analysis restricting cases as being the first registered event of surgical interventions pertaining to aortic or mitral regurgitation. Lastly, we
performed the first analysis, defining valvular regurgitation using diagnostic
codes, in a cohort of patients diagnosed with arterial hypertension (i.e.
patients considered at high risk of valvular regurgitation according to the
EMA warning). As such, in this cohort, eligible patients were identified on
the date of their first registered diagnosis of arterial hypertension and
included in the cohort 3 years following hypertension diagnosis (baseline) as
FQ exposure was defined up to a period of 3 years prior as explained later.
For all three analyses, controls were sampled from the described
cohorts and matched to the cases in a 30:1 ratio on sex, age, and year of
the index date. However, in the hypertension cohort, we matched on age
groups. Individuals in the cohorts were continuously censored during follow-up if they were diagnosed with any of the competing events of infective endocarditis or connective tissue disorders. Further, in the analysis
with a case definition of surgery, patients were censored if they were
diagnosed with aortic stenosis to avoid capturing aortic valve replacement due to aortic stenosis as a case. Thus, the control group consisted
of patients being alive, residing in Denmark, with native heart valves (without aortic stenosis in the secondary analysis), without a history of the outcome in question (diagnosis or surgery pertaining to valvular
regurgitation, respectively), infective endocarditis, or connective tissue
disorders at corresponding case date.

fitted with time-varying covariates using the entire sampling population as
a cohort with both patient characteristics for adjustments as well as FQ
exposure updated continuously.24,25 The level of statistical significance
was set at 5%. Analyses were conducted in R (version 3.6.1).28

Supplementary analyses
Instead of using penicillin V as the active comparator drug, supplementary
analyses were performed using macrolides and amoxicillin separately as
reference. These drugs were chosen as they were deemed comparable
due to somewhat similar clinical indications in a Danish context. However,
as previously stated, penicillin V is the first-line treatment for suspected
pneumonia in patients without severe COPD. As such, amoxicillin use in
Denmark is somewhat limited and this group of patients is likely more

Results
Main cohort
A total of 4 416 252 individuals were eligible for inclusion in the cohort (Figure 1). The median age was 46 years (IQR 32-61) and there
was a small majority of males (51%). Prevalent comorbidities were ischaemic heart disease (3%), diabetes (3%), and atrial fibrillation (1%)
(Supplementary material online, Table S2). Within 5 years of inclusion, 6.2% of patients had redeemed at least one prescription of FQ
and just below 1% had redeemed at least three (Supplementary
material online, Figure S1).
Using diagnostic codes, we identified a total of 38 370 cases of aortic or mitral valve regurgitation and 1 115 100 control subjects
matched on age group, sex, and calendar year. Of these cases, 18 906
(49.3%) were based on a diagnosis pertaining to the aortic valve, 17
503 (45.6%) to the mitral valve, and 1961 (5.1%) had regurgitant disease of both valves.
The median age of the matched cases and controls was 70 years
(IQR 61-78) with a slight overweight of females (51%).
Cardiovascular comorbidities were much more prevalent among
cases than controls regarding ischaemic heart disease (18% vs. 6%),
atrial fibrillation (17% vs. 5%), and heart failure (10% vs. 2%) (Table 1).
Regarding surgery, we identified 4008 cases of surgical interventions due to aortic or mitral valve regurgitation with 120 240
matched controls. The median age was 66 years (IQR 57-73) with
more males (68%). The cases generally had much more cardiovascular comorbidity than their matched controls (Table 2).

Rates of diagnoses of valvular
regurgitation
Treatment with FQs within 1 year prior to the date of interest conferred no increase in the rates of aortic or mitral valve regurgitation
compared with patients exposed to penicillin V (HR 1.02, 95% CI
0.95-1.09) (Figure 2A).
When examining more recent exposure to FQs (30 and 90 days),
we found similar results with no indications of increased rates of
valvular regurgitation (30 days: HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.67-1.24 and
90 days: HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.81-1.06).

Rates of surgery due to valvular
regurgitation
Restricting our case definition to only included cases of regurgitation
undergoing surgery did not change our conclusions. As such, FQs did
not lead to increased rates of surgeries due to aortic or mitral valve
regurgitation compared with penicillin V (Figure 2B).

Dose-response association of
fluoroquinolone exposure
We observed no dose-response relationship between the cumulative exposure to FQs and the rates of valvular regurgitation. As such,
having a cDDD of 6-10, and a cDDD >10 conferred comparable
rates of valvular regurgitation to patients with a cDDD of 1-5 [HR
1.06 (95% CI 0.95-1.19) and HR 1.08 (95% CI 0.95-1.23)] (Figure 3A).
Using a case definition based on surgical interventions due to valvular
regurgitation showed similar results (Figure 3B).

Controls were matched on sex, age, and year of the index date.

Hypertension cohort
We included a supplementary cohort comprising 448 274 patients
diagnosed with arterial hypertension. Eligible patients had a median
age of 69 years (IQR 59-78), a slight majority of females (54%), and a
general high prevalence of cardiovascular comorbidities compared
with the main analysis cohort (Supplementary material online, Table
S3). Further, FQ use was much more common in the hypertension
cohort (Supplementary material online, Figure S1).
Similarly, in patients with hypertension, treatment with FQs was
not associated with an increase in the rates of aortic or mitral valve
regurgitation compared with patients exposed to penicillin V (HR
1.06, 95% CI 0.92-1.21). Moreover, we found no associations between FQ exposure and valvular regurgitation when investigating
more recent exposure windows (30 and 90 days) as well as a potential dose-response relationship (Figure 4).

Supplementary analyses
Performing the primary analyses of the study using different active
comparator drugs (macrolides and amoxicillin) did not alter our conclusions. As such, treatment with FQs did not confer increased rates
of aortic or mitral regurgitation compared with patients treated with
macrolides or amoxicillin (Supplementary material online, Figure S2).
Differences in rates of aortic or mitral regurgitation were found
according to age groups in the main cohort using diagnoses codes as
case definition. No differences in age groups were found when using
surgical intervention as a case definition in the hypertension cohort,
and no dose-response relationship was found (Supplementary

and history of cancer yielded results comparable to the main analysis
as well (Supplementary material online, Table S7).

Discussion
In this nationwide nested case-control study, there were several important findings: (i) in our data, FQ use was not associated with significantly
increased rates of aortic or mitral regurgitation in contrast with what
has been reported elsewhere; (ii) no dose-response relationship between the cDDD of FQs and the rates of aortic or mitral regurgitation
was found; and (iii) these results were consistent when restricting the
definition of valvular regurgitation to patients undergoing surgical interventions as well as in a cohort of patients with hypertension deemed at
high risk of valvular regurgitation (Graphical abstract).
Fluoroquinolones are a class of relatively commonly prescribed
antibiotics due to their broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity.1,4,22
Fluoroquinolones have been shown to up-regulate matrix metalloproteinases resulting in degradation of collagen fibrils, especially in
type I collagen, which is also the presumed mechanism behind the
increased risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture associated with
FQs.8,29,30 As type I and type III collagen comprise 80-90% of the collagen in the aorta, concerns regarding aortic aneurysms and aortic
dissections associated with FQ treatment have been raised in epidemiological studies.5-7,31 Similarly, collagen fibres consisting of predominantly type I collagen are a primary constituent of the native
valves of the heart and is the putative mechanistic link between FQ

Fluoroquinolones and the risk of valve regurgitation

exposure and valve regurgitation.32 In this context, a study hypothesized that the collagen degrading effects of FQs could affect the cerebral arteries but found no association between FQ exposure and
increased risks of intracranial aneurysm or dissection.33
A recent study based on a sample from a large health insurance
claims database from the USA reported increased risks of aortic and
mitral regurgitation in patients with a history of FQ use.10 The
authors reported rate ratios of valvular regurgitation ranging from 2.4
to 1.8, depending on the comparator drug. These data, along with
basic research indicating that FQ exposure causes impaired collagen1 expression in human aortic myofibroblasts, have led the EMA to
publish a direct communication to healthcare professionals warning
that FQs may cause damage to the heart valves leading to valvular regurgitation-especially in certain high-risk groups of patients.9,11
However, the definition of the study population as well as general
data quality and reliability of important study variables were somewhat unclear in the referenced study.10 Further, it is unclear if the
authors considered the indication of the active comparators as symptoms displayed by the diseases could lead to surveillance bias. Lastly,
differences in prescription patterns of antibiotics and the censoring of
patients at diagnosis of endocarditis done in our study may account
for the differences in the results.

Interestingly, in our study comprising both a nationwide cohort of
adults as well as a population of patients categorized as potentially
high-risk patients (i.e. patients with documented hypertension), we
were not able to reproduce this finding. We consistently found no association between FQ use and increased rates of incident aortic or
mitral regurgitation. To further strengthen this conclusion, we did
not find any dose-response relationship between increased cumulative exposure to FQs and aortic or mitral regurgitation. We believe
this is a strong argument against any clinically meaningful relationship
between FQs and valvular damage as we would expect that an
increased risk of valvular regurgitation would be accentuated with
prolonged FQ exposure.
Several case reports have suggested that, when present, the clinical
presentation of the collagen degrading properties of FQs could be
potentially acute with aortic valve prolapse or tendon rupture occurring within days of treatment initiation.34,35 However, changing the
definition of our exposure to a maximum of 30 days elapsed since the
latest filled FQ prescription and, as such, only capturing patients with
very recent FQ exposure did not alter our conclusions. Moreover,
from a clinical and mechanistic standpoint, such a noticeable relationship between FQ use and short-term risk of severe valvular regurgitation seems rather unlikely.

Strengths and limitations
The main limitations of our study are related to the observational nature of our study design and since our data are not randomized, causality cannot be directly inferred as residual confounding may
influence the study. However, this is a difficult research question to
answer in a randomized controlled trial stressing the need for observational data. Using large healthcare registers, the potential for misclassification bias must also be acknowledged as some of the
diagnostic and procedural codes used in the definition of covariates
have not been validated. However, the majority of codes used for
defining important study variables have undergone scrutiny for data
quality with high positive predictive values including the codes for
aortic and mitral regurgitation as well as valvular surgery.36-38 The
data used in the Danish National Prescription Register for defining
antibiotic exposure have, to the best of our knowledge, not been validated. However, the register is generally believed to be of high quality
and validation studies examining the quality of registered prescriptions for oral anticoagulants and strong analgesics reported a high degree of completeness of registration.15 Finally, using complete
nationwide databases in a setting with universal and equal access to
healthcare services, drastically decreases selection bias.

Conclusions
In this nationwide register-based nested case-control study, we did
not find evidence to support that treatment with FQs was associated
with significantly increased rates of aortic or mitral regurgitation. This
lack of a significant association was consistent across a subgroup of
high-risk patients with hypertension as well as when investigating a
potential dose-response effect. These data are conflicting with previous reports on the subject as well as a recent safety concern published by the EMA. Our findings do not support a possible causal
connection between FQ exposure and incident valvular regurgitation.
Therefore, further research is needed before conclusions can be
drawn regarding the safety of FQs pertaining to valvular
regurgitation.

The weak effect of age on rates of aortic or mitral regurgitation
was only found in the main analysis and no differences were observed
between FQ and penicillin V across age groups in the hypertension
cohort, surgical interventions, and no dose-response relationship
was found. Possible differences in patient characteristics according to
age group may explain this association rather than an effect of FQ
itself.
Conclusively, despite recent reports in the literature of increased
risks of valvular regurgitation associated with FQs, using a contemporary nationwide cohort of patients, we were not able to reproduce
this finding.
Our data are noteworthy, given that FQs should be used with caution for this specific reason according to the EMA, especially in highrisk groups such as patients with hypertension.11 These conflicting
data underline the need for further research before any conclusions
regarding the harm or safety of FQs pertaining to valvular regurgitation can be drawn.
