A 42-year-old woman was diagnosed
with granulomatosis with polyangiitis
(GPA) revealing positive cANCA and
proteinase- 3 antibodies. The computed
tomography of the thorax revealed a
persisting 7 cm large lesion in the right
upper lobe of the lung. A remissionmaintaining therapy with 500 mg rituximab every 6 months in combination
with low-dose prednisolone was performed. Two years later, recurrent palpitations, nausea, and fatigue occurred.
ECG showed a 3rd-degree AV block.
Laboratory results revealed elevated
heart enzymes (troponin I 2.6 mg/mL,
CK 534 U/L). CHD was ruled out.
Echocardiography did not show any relevant changes. A DDD pacemaker was
implanted without complications. A few
days after discharge, the patient presented with cardiogenic shock. On Day
3, the patient had to be resuscitated and
extracorporeal life support was performed. Echocardiography showed a severely reduced ejection fraction of both ventricles. Assuming a cardiac
manifestation of GPA, high-dose steroid administration and repeat administration of 650 mg rituximab were performed. Multi-organ failure with
severe coagulation disorder occurred. Meanwhile, endomyocardial biopsies (EMB) were performed revealing a fulminant lymphocytic myocarditis with extensive myocardial necrosis (see Panels A-D). RT-PCR revealed a high load of enteroviral RNA in the myocardium; sequencing of the
PCR product identified coxsackievirus B2 RNA. After interim clinical improvement, the patient died on the 11th day of immunosuppressive treatment. This case report stresses the relevance of EMB for the correct diagnosis of acute heart failure, thus avoiding the lethal immunosuppressive
therapy of enteroviral myocarditis by rituximab and steroids.
Fulminant lymphocytic myocarditis. (Panel A) Masson Trichrome and (Panel B) Giemsa staining reveal myocyte necrosis and inflammation
with mononuclear infiltrates. Immunohistochemical stainings demonstrate high amounts of (Panel C) CD3th T lymphocytes and (Panel D)
CD68th macrophages (400).
