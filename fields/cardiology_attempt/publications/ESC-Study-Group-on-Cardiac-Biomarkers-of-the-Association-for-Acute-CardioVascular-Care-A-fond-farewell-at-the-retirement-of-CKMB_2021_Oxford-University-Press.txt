Transitions in medicine often are difficult especially when they involve
diagnostic methods that are used widely. Clinicians may find some of
the new tools hard to understand especially when they are comfortable with the approaches in use. This may particularly be the case
with laboratory testing which often has far reaching consequences.
The graphic of the changes in the biomarkers used to diagnose acute
myocardial infarction (MI) over time is provided in Figure 1. The problems associated with incorporating new testing into clinical paradigms
may reflect in part the fact that important elements of the analytics of
laboratory testing are less emphasized during medical school and clinical training than they were in the past. In addition, there is a need for
closer communication between laboratory professional and diagnosticians so that the technical and analytical advances with the testing
and application of novel biomarkers are better appreciated.
The declining use of the muscle/brain (MB) isoenzyme of creatine
kinase (CK) is a good example. Initially, the use of CKMB was a major
advance in the ability to detect acute myocardial injury because it was
more sensitive and specific than other markers that had been applied
such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) serum glutamic oxaloacetic
transaminase (SGOT or AST 3) and total CK.1 Originally, it appeared
that CKMB activity might be highly specific for injury of myocytes in
the myocardium.1 This was a function of the way in which CKMB activity was measured because in essence detection depended on

CKMB being present as a high percentage of total CK activity.
Otherwise it might be missed (Appendix 1). This problem was appreciated by those in the laboratory but was only unmasked for clinicians
when CKMB mass concentration assays were developed, which
were more sensitive.2 It then became clear that increases in CKMB
values were common especially after non cardiac surgeries where
skeletal muscle was injured,1 trauma,1 exercise,1 or with renal failure.1 These increases were especially large when chronic skeletal
muscle disease was present because damage to skeletal muscle
results in a return to embryological patterns of isoforms and reexpression of the B chain of CK as part of the reparative process.3
Because myocardium has a higher proportion of CKMB than most
skeletal muscle,1 there were a variety of attempts to use the percentage of CKMB relative to the absolute amount of total CK to distinguish cardiac release from skeletal muscle release.1 This approach
worked reasonably well when only cardiac injury or only skeletal
muscle injury was present. However, when there was conjoint skeletal muscle and myocardial injury, the percentage of CKMB elevation
was lowered by the high levels of total CK and thus, the sensitivity of
CKMB was lost.3 This imperfection was clearly shown early on with
the use of cardiac troponin (cTn) assays.4 In addition, spurious
increases in CKMB values were detected in patients with renal failure,
haemolysis, hyperbilirubinemia,1 and in case of circulating

macrokinases, i.e. immunoglobulins linked to CK.1 In addition, there
could be cross reactivity with the tags used for detection in the mass
assays.1
Many clinicians were pleased with that state of the art. The fact
that there were elevations of CKMB not due to cardiac abnormalities
allowed them flexibility to determine which increases they would
view seriously and which ones they could reasonably ignore. In the
hands of good clinicians, this approach probably worked fairly well, although there likely were times when important diagnoses were
missed even by astute clinicians. But problems occurred when there
was conjoint skeletal muscle and cardiac injury became more common when CKMB was used to screen patients in the Emergency
Department (ED) and after surgical procedures. Finally, a time lag of
up to 4 h and sometimes even more from the onset of chest pain to
the detection of increasing concentrations of CK and CKMB in
plasma limited the possibility of a rapid diagnosis of acute myocardial
infarction (AMI).5 This has obviously be remedied with the use of
high-sensitivity cTn assays.6
The use of CKMB diagnostically has diminished as a result of these
problems and the development of cTn assays which are more sensitive and specific. Many now question whether there is still any role
for CKMB at all.7 Thus, in many places, the use of CKMB has been
obsoleted. However, some clinicians particularly invasive cardiologists remain faithful to CKMB because, it is less sensitive and fluctuates less despite its many analytical confounds. Although one can
have analytical problems with cTn, they are infrequent.7 In addition,
the release of cTn is highly specific and very sensitive for myocardial
injury/necrosis and thus cTn has become the biomarker of choice for
diagnosing and risk stratifying AMI.8 Moreover, increases in CKMB
not accompanied by increases in cTn values have been found not to
be associated with adverse prognostic affects.9 For that reason, the

use of CKMB has no role in this setting as stated in the most recent
ESC guidelines.7
Some clinicians might argue that there are other reasons where
the measurement of CKMB might be useful. The original European
Society of Cardiology/ American College of Cardiology (ESC/ACC)
redefinition of MI document that over time became the Universal
Definition of Myocardial Infarction (UDMI) included the use of
CKMB for detection of possible reinfarction.10 At that time, there
were sparse data about this area and given that cTn increases persisted for days or weeks it was hypothesized that a marker that disappeared more quickly such as CKMB might be helpful. However, later,
it was shown that this hypothesis was incorrect. In fact, diagnostically
important re-elevations of cTn values despite an elevated level of cTn
were easy to observe.11 In contrast, when CKMB is increased, it can
be difficult to see a changing pattern.
An additional area of controversy that persists even to this day is
related to the desire of some interventionalists to use CKMB in the
periprocedural period.12 The initial reports in this area suggested that
increases in CKMB were associated with complications related to the
procedures that were done.12 Their prognostic significance was not
thought to be of importance. This changed when the studies began
to include patients who had acute MI.13 At that time, it was argued
that CKMB elevations after percutaenous coronary intervention
(PCI) imparted similar prognostic significance as that seen prior to
the PCI.14 Most importantly, the data seemed to suggest that despite
the fact that even though the procedures were uncomplicated, the
increases of CKMB were due to PCI. Subsequently, it was appreciated that CKMB was rising slowly, although it was still within the normal range in the majority of patients. This was hard to appreciate
because of the lack of sensitivity of CKMB testing but when one sees
other markers that are more sensitive like cTn rising, it is clear that

discontinued

It is less sensitive to detect myocardial injury and infarction compared to cTn.
It does not add to diagnosis of risk stratification in patients with
possible AMI.

(3)

It is not needed to diagnose reinfarction-cTn performs better.

(4)

The prolonged time lag before CKMB appearance delays the detection of myocardial injury compared to cTn and especially hscTn.

(5)

It is not required for detecting periprocedural myocardial injury-
cTn accomplishes this with greater sensitivity.

cTn, cardiac troponin.

CKMB likely is rising as well.15 Consequently, the assumption that the
adverse prognosis associated with this additional myocardial injury
was due to the procedure itself was understandable but likely erroneous. Indeed, it is likely that in the vast majority of cases the poor outcomes in those with periprocedural increases were due to the
original insult that led the patient to be admitted to hospital. In more
elective situations, where the biomarkers are not rising prior to the
procedure, an increased cTn value is associated with more extensive
and more complex anatomy,16 often not detected with CKMB. In
both situations, whether the values are increasing or are simply elevated, including the baseline sample in the evaluation ablates the
prognostic impact of post-PCI increases regardless of the biomarker
used for detection.17 Some clinicians have been reluctant to embrace
this reality and the response has been to use cTn at higher than normal values as a baseline or to use CKMB.12 Neither approach is desirable or helpful. This does not mean that important degrees of
myocardial injury do not occur with procedures, only that most of
the important prognostic information is contained in the baseline
sample. It is for that reason that the UDMI has insisted on showing a
normal cTn value or at least one that is stable prior to the procedure
before one can attempt to define a significant procedural-related
MI.18 When the baseline cTn value is normal, increases of cardiac biomarkers post-procedurally are of prognostic significance whether
with CKMB or with cTn.12,16,17
Similar claims have been made when dealing with postoperative
cardiac surgical settings. More marked increases in CKMB and cTn
are associated with a worse prognosis although cTn is a more robust
predictor of mortality than CKMB.19 Thus, cTnI had the strongest association with 5-year mortality compared with CKMB in a large study
of CABG patients.19
Finally, there are issues of cost. In a recent ED analysis, by nearly
eliminating CKMB ordering lowered costs by $47,000 per year.20
Not included was personnel time nor charges to the health care systems. None of the 17 patients with increased CKMB and normal cTn
had events. Given, its clinical efficacy is poor to non-existent and cost

is significant, it is hard to understand the persistence of this marker in
the armamentarium of laboratories.
Given the above (see Table 1), it is hard to define clinical scenarios
where CKMB is helpful. It adds cost but not clinical benefit.8,10,20 In
addition, it may keep clinicians from learning how to use cTn for
these clinical scenarios. Furthermore, the advent of high-sensitivity
cTn (hsc-Tn) assays has increased the ability to detect myocardial
injury at an even earlier phase permitting rapid rule-in of AMI6 and so
CKMB is no longer needed. Therefore, the ESC Biomarker Study
Group of the Association for Acute Cardiovascular Care suggests
that CKMB be eliminated from the menu of biomarkers available for
use in the evaluation of patients with cardiovascular disease.

Appendix 1. Electrophoretic separations for CKMB
activity
To measure CKMB activity assessed by international units per litre
(IU/L), the biochemical substrate conditions need to be optimized to
make sure that reagents used in the assay are not depleted because of
high CK activity. This meant that the total CK activity of the sample
was diluted so it was no more than 300 IU/L. Then, the sample was
run on an electrophoretic system a sensitivity of somewhere between 5
and 10 IU/L. If CKMB was not detected, the sample was viewed incorrectly as having no CKMB. For example, if the sample had been
diluted 10-fold from the value of 3000 IU/L and the true value was
4 IU/L (below the sensitivity of the electrophoretic separation), then
one would have had had an absolute value of 40 IU that was missed.
