Multisystem inflammatory syndrome
in children (MIS-C) is a rare complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with an
incidence of about 1:100 000 children.
According to published case series,
between 10% and 40% of MIS-C
develop coronary artery modifications, mainly hyperechogenicity, with
a lower incidence of true aneurysm.
In a previous issue of this journal,
we reported the case of a 10-year-old
male with medium left anterior
descending (LAD) coronary artery
aneurysm (z-score th7.9) and small
right coronary artery (RCA) aneurysm
(z-score th2.9) detected 1 week after
his hospital admission for hypotensive
shock in the context of MIS-C. He was
treated with 2 g/kg intravenous immunoglobulin (administered after coronary artery dilatation was observed, as
the recognition of MIS-C was contemporary with our case), corticosteroids,
and anakinra. He rapidly normalized his
initial mild LV dysfunction and cardiac
enzymes elevation.
The patient has been on antiplatelet
therapy since discharge with regular
outpatient cardiology follow-up.
Repeat computed tomography at 6 months demonstrated coronary artery aneurysms regression (Panels A and C, curved muliplanar reconstruction and Panels B and D, volume rendering), with near normalization of the coronary arteries maximal diameter: LAD z-score th2.3
and RAD z-score th1.8. Moreover, no coronary stenosis was observed.
Coronary arteryaneurysm in the context of MIS-C can regress after a few months. Further research is needed to assess if this finding
reflects a generalisable outcome and to study the effect of medical treatment in the evolution of coronary artery dilatation post-MIS-C.
