See page 4049 for the editorial comment for this article 'Low-dose rivaroxaban plus aspirin for elderly patients with symptomatic peripheral artery disease: is it worth the bleeding risk?', by J. Zhang, et al., https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab602.

Aims

In this secondary analysis of the VOYAGER trial, rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice/day plus aspirin 100 mg/day was assessed
in older adults. Advanced age is associated with elevated bleeding risk and unfavourable net benefit for dual antiplatelet therapy in chronic coronary artery disease. The risk-benefit of low-dose rivaroxaban in patients >_75 years with
peripheral artery disease (PAD) after lower extremity revascularization (LER) has not been described.

Methods
The primary endpoint was a composite of acute limb ischaemia, major amputation, myocardial infarction, ischaemic
and results
stroke, or cardiovascular death. The principal safety outcome was thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI)

major bleeding analysed by the pre-specified age cut-off of 75 years. Of 6564 patients randomized, 1330 (20%)
were >75 years. Absolute 3-year Kaplan-Meier cumulative incidence rates for primary efficacy (23.4% vs. 19.0%)
and safety (3.5% vs. 1.5%) endpoints were higher in elderly vs. non-elderly patients. Efficacy of rivaroxaban (P-interaction 0.83) and safety (P-interaction 0.38) was consistent irrespective of age. The combination of intracranial and
fatal bleeding was not increased in patients >75 years (2 rivaroxaban vs. 8 placebo). Overall, benefits (absolute risk
reduction 3.8%, number needed to treat 26 for the primary endpoint) exceeded risks (absolute risk increase
0.81%, number needed to harm 123 for TIMI major bleeding).

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
Patients >_75 years with PAD are at both heightened ischaemic and bleeding risk after LER. No excess harm with respect
to major, intracranial or fatal bleeding was seen in older patients yet numerically greater absolute benefits were observed.
This suggests that low-dose rivaroxaban combined with aspirin should be considered in PAD after LER regardless of age.

Introduction
Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a progressive atherosclerotic disorder; it can be asymptomatic, but often results in profound functional limitation, acute limb-threatening ischaemia, and amputation.1
More than 235 million individuals worldwide are afflicted, and age is
one of the most important risk factors for PAD.1,2 Despite an elevated risk for major adverse limb events (MALE) and major adverse
cardiovascular events (MACE), patients with PAD are less likely to be
treated with antithrombotic therapy compared with their coronary
artery disease (CAD) counterparts.3 Within a nationally representative outpatient population among which 25% of patients with PAD
were >_80 years of age, just 38% were treated with aspirin.4 One potential reason for undertreatment, despite American College of
Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) PAD secondary prevention guidelines,5 is concern regarding greater bleeding liability with advanced age. Quantification of bleeding risk by

cardiologists, however, is poor and bleeding scores such as ACUITY
and CRUSADE add little to enhance risk prediction.6 Moreover,
while 90% of patients overestimate bleeding risk from antithrombotic
therapy,7 physicians also overestimate risk and hesitate to initiate
anticoagulation.8,9 Clinical uncertainty regarding benefit-risk balance
is reinforced by bleeding scores such as ACUITY, CRUSADE, DAPT,
and PRECISE-DAPT, which emphasize advanced age as a negative
consideration for the initiation of antithrombotic agents for secondary prevention in patients with atherosclerosis.6,10
Older PAD patients have been under-represented in earlier antithrombotic trials,11 and while recent evidence suggests that low-dose
rivaroxaban and aspirin is beneficial in stable PAD,12 the benefit-risk
balance in older adults acutely after percutaneous or surgical lower extremity revascularization (LER) has not been previously studied. Given
this background, the present study sought to address uncertainty
regarding the use of combination antithrombotic therapy for patients
>_75 years. We ascertained efficacy and safety within the Vascular

Methods
Study design and patient population

Efficacy and safety outcomes
The primary efficacy outcome was the composite of ALI, major amputation of a vascular aetiology, myocardial infarction (MI), ischaemic stroke,
or cardiovascular death including unknown and sudden death. The individual components of the efficacy composite were also assessed. Secondary
efficacy endpoints included unplanned hospitalization for a coronary or
peripheral vascular event of a thrombotic nature and unplanned revascularization for ischaemia in the index limb. The principal safety outcome
was thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) classification major
bleeding. Secondary safety endpoints included TIMI minor bleeding,
International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) major
bleeding and Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) 3b or
higher bleeding events. All efficacy and safety events were adjudicated
centrally.14

Statistical analysis
Efficacy analyses were conducted on all randomized patients using the
principle of intention-to-treat (ITT). Safety analyses were conducted as
on-treatment, which included all individuals who received at least one
dose of study drug and followed for 2 days after the last receipt of active
treatment to approximate 5 half-lives of oral rivaroxaban. Event probabilities were expressed as Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimates of the cumulative

.. incidence of each pre-specified outcome at 3 years. Hazard ratios with
..
.. 95% confidence interval (CI) were then generated by stratified Cox pro.. portional hazards modelling and all reported P-values were two-sided,
.. with a P-value of <0.05 considered statistically significant. Interaction P..
.. values were generated for efficacy and safety results, evaluating differen.. ces between the subgroups of age <75 years vs. >_75 years. All P-values
..
.. were based on the Monte Carlo Estimate for the Wilcoxon exact test for
.. continuous variables and on either Fisher's exact test or the Monte Carlo
..
.. estimate for the Freeman-Halton exact test for categorical variables.
..
The probability of the primary outcome of MALE plus MACE as a func..
tion
of age as a spline effect of degree 3 (piecewise cubic curve) was esti..
.. mated for each treatment group by logistic regression, with a logit link
.. function and the logarithm of follow-up time utilized as an offset variable
..
.. in the models. Absolute risk reduction (ARR), absolute risk increase (ARI)
.. and number needed to treat (NNT) and number needed to harm (NNH)
..
.. were calculated to assess the benefit-risk balance of low-dose rivaroxa.. ban. Events prevented vs. caused were calculated using ITT analyses for ef..
.. ficacy and on-treatment for evaluating safety. All analyses were performed

VOYAGER PAD was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial,
which tested the hypothesis that low-dose rivaroxaban in addition to an
antiplatelet agent would reduce ischaemic limb and cardiovascular events
among PAD patients undergoing revascularization. The trial design and primary results have been previously published.13,14 Specifically, the addition
of a selective, direct factor Xa inhibitor (rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily)
plus acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin 100 mg daily) was compared with aspirin
monotherapy. Computerized randomization was performed centrally,
stratified according to index LER procedure (endovascular vs. surgical) and
by clopidogrel use/non-use within patients who underwent an endovascular procedure. Study participant randomization was not stratified by age.
In VOYAGER, enrolled subjects had moderate to severe symptomatic
lower extremity atherosclerotic PAD as evidenced by functional limitations, ischaemic rest pain, or ischaemic ulceration with corresponding
imaging evidence of disease distal to the external iliac artery. Patients were
required to have undergone an infra-inguinal, peripheral revascularization
procedure within 10 days prior to randomization. Patients >_50 years of
age were included, without an upper age limit cut-off. Key exclusion criteria
included recent acute limb ischaemia (ALI) or acute coronary syndrome,
any medical condition that could increase the risk of major bleeding, documented history of intracranial haemorrhage, stroke, or transient ischaemic
attack or severely impaired renal function at baseline screening defined as
an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <15 mL/min/1.73 m2 or the
receipt of chronic renal replacement therapy. We sought to assess differences in both ischaemic and bleeding outcomes with combined antithrombotic therapy according to categorical age thresholds. Older age was prespecified as >_75 years prior to closure of the database, analogous to the
highest age strata specified in the Cardiovascular Outcomes for People
Using Anticoagulation Strategies (COMPASS) trial.12

amputation of a vascular aetiology, MI, ischaemic stroke, or CV death
was reduced by rivaroxaban consistently among patients >_75 years
[hazard ratio (HR) 0.82, 95% CI 0.64, 1.05, P = 0.058], and those aged
<75 years (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75, 0.98, P for interaction 0.83) (Figures
1 and 2). The benefit of rivaroxaban in patients >_75 was primarily
driven by reductions in limb vascular events including ALI (HR 0.35,
95% CI 0.19-0.64, P = 0.0004) and the occurrence of major amputation of vascular aetiology (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.31-1.10, P = 0.09, Table
2). Overall, there was consistency for the effect of rivaroxaban
amongst the components of the primary efficacy outcome with the
exception of ALI, where the benefit appeared to be even greater in
those >_75 years relative to those <75 years (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.60-
0.93, P-interaction 0.0193). Overall, rivaroxaban reduced the first five
of the pre-specified secondary outcomes and there was no statistical
heterogeneity in treatment effect in those >_75 vs. <75 years
(Table 2). Among these outcomes, the composite of ALI, major

amputation of a vascular aetiology, MI, ischaemic stroke, or coronary
heart disease death (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.57-0.97) and hospitalization
for a coronary or peripheral event of a thrombotic nature (HR 0.64,

with rivaroxaban, eight with placebo). Secondary bleeding outcomes
including ISTH major and BARC 3b or greater events showed the

clopidogrel at baseline, there were 10 TIMI major bleeding events
out of 349 patients in the rivaroxaban group balanced with 10 out of
343 patients in the placebo group.

Benefit-risk balance
Overall, in VOYAGER PAD, there was a favourable benefit-risk profile when considering the number of primary efficacy outcomes prevented vs. the number of principal safety outcomes caused. In the
current analysis, due to their higher overall risk of the primary outcome, patients >_75 had a greater ARR in the ITT analysis (3.8% ARR
in those >_75 vs. 2.5% ARR <75 years) resulting in a more favourable
NNT of 26 vs. 41 in those age categories, respectively. The cost of
this, when considering the on-treatment safety analysis, was an ARI in
those >_75 for TIMI major bleeding of 0.81% translating to an NNH of
123 individuals. In addition, there was no pattern for increased intracranial haemorrhage or fatal bleeding in those >_75 and numerically
fewer with rivaroxaban vs. placebo in the on-treatment analysis.
When considering 1000 PAD patients after LER followed for 3 years
with rivaroxaban add-on therapy, 38 events (predominantly ALI and
major amputation) would be prevented at the cost of 8 TIMI major
bleeds but no intracranial haemorrhage or fatal bleeding events
(Figure 3).

Discussion
The current study demonstrates several noteworthy observations.
First, the risk of the composite outcome of ALI, major amputation of
a vascular aetiology, MI, ischaemic stroke, or cardiovascular death in
PAD patients after LER is higher in those >_75 vs. <75 years old.
Second, although the risk of cardiovascular and limb outcomes was
globally higher in those >_75 years, ALI remained significantly more

frequent than MI or stroke, where the benefit of rivaroxaban was primarily driven by reductions in ALI and amputation. Third, the benefit
of rivaroxaban in this population was consistent regardless of age;
however, due to the higher risk profile of patients >_75, this population had a larger absolute benefit and lower NNT driven by an even
greater benefit for ALI. In fact, there was a significant interaction indicating the possibility for an even greater benefit in those >_75 vs.
<75 years. Finally, although patients >_75 are generally at higher
bleeding risk, there was no pattern for excess bleeding with rivaroxaban in those >_75 and numerically fewer severe bleeding events such
as intracranial or fatal haemorrhage (Graphical abstract). In addition,
female sex was more prevalent in PAD patients who were >_75 at
randomization, which is a population of special interest where hesitancy prescribing antithrombotic therapy may also exist and where
sex-based differences in outcomes have been described.15
Moreover, the elderly subgroup included a higher proportion of
Asian patients, which supports the generalizability of our findings.
Taken together, these data underscore the high limb risk among
patients >_75 with PAD undergoing LER and that the net benefit of
rivaroxaban remains favourable in this diverse, elderly population.
Our findings that advanced age is associated with a higher risk for
MALE and MACE events, which can be reduced by rivaroxaban on
top of aspirin, has also been demonstrated in the COMPASS trial.12
This study evaluated patients with stable atherosclerotic vascular disease that had not required a recent LER procedure. In contrast to
VOYAGER PAD, 90.6% of the participants in COMPASS had CAD,
while just 27.3% had PAD. Nonetheless, in COMPASS, combination
therapy was effective in reducing major limb complications across all
age strata including those >_75 years, consistent with the current
study. From a public health perspective, the higher observed rates of
MALE and MACE in older adults is particularly important since hospitalization and the inherent activity restriction is associated with substantial disability among older patients in the USA.16
The benefit-risk profile of a low-dose anticoagulation-aspirin strategy in older adults with PAD after LER appears very favourable. The
efficacy of this combination of an antiplatelet drug and an agent targeting thrombin is further supported by the findings with vorapaxar, a
novel antagonist of platelet receptor for thrombin, which showed
reductions in MALE and MACE across age strata including those
>_75 years.17 However, comparative efficacy relative to the oftenprescribed dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) regimen has not been
characterized in head-to-head clinical trials. Dual antiplatelet therapy
is commonly utilized after percutaneous peripheral arterial revascularization analogous to its use after percutaneous coronary intervention, though it currently is not an AHA/ACC class Ia guideline
recommendation in PAD patients.5 Moreover, DAPT possesses a distinct bleeding liability, particularly in the elderly. For example, in
patients with stable CAD, the combination of the P2Y12 inhibitor
ticagrelor plus aspirin minimally reduced the incidence of cardiovascular events, yet TIMI major bleeding was significantly increased.18 In
contrast, in VOYAGER, rivaroxaban was efficacious in those >_75, but
without a disproportionate major bleeding signal and no increase in
fatal or intracranial haemorrhage. Taken together, these data support
a dual pathway approach in high-risk patients regardless of age. A
paradigm of low-dose anticoagulation combined with a low dose/low
potency antiplatelet drug may provide an optimal benefit-risk balance in older PAD patients after LER. Accordingly, an index limb

revascularization procedure could serve as a clinical trigger to initiate
rivaroxaban. This strategy is foundational to the AHA Get With The
Guidelines (GWTG) programme, where inpatient initiation of
guideline-directed medical therapies is the strongest predictor of
long-term adherence and improved outcomes.19
Notable and novel in the current analysis is the marked reduction
in ischaemic limb events and major amputations. This is a potentially
critical finding since the occurrence of major limb events has substantial downstream implications for event-free survival. In support of
this, a recent analysis from COMPASS found that the development of
MALE is associated with a dire prognosis.20 The index limb event in

COMPASS, modelled as a time-dependent covariate in a Cox proportional hazards model, resulted in a staggering risk of total vascular
amputation (HR 197.5, 95% CI, 97.33-400.8), cardiovascular hospitalization (HR 11.72, 95% CI 9.04-15.21), and all-cause mortality (HR
3.23, 95% CI 1.87-5.56). Similar findings were observed within a national, hospital database where among 393,017 revascularized
patients, 12.9% experienced MALE after just 2.7 years of follow-up.21
This underscores the substantial unmet need for safe and effective
secondary prevention therapies in patients with PAD be it stable disease as studied in COMPASS or unstable, symptomatic PAD requiring revascularization in VOYAGER. The observed benefits also

highlight the role of both the coagulation cascade and platelet activation, and the complex interplay between the two, that underlies the
pathogenesis of arterial thrombotic events. The robust benefits particularly for ALI suggest that such severe arterial events are highly
modifiable using a strategy that combines inhibition of platelets with
low-dose anticoagulation and with a tolerable bleeding profile.
The treatment gap in PAD regarding antithrombotic therapy22
mirrors the gap in other guideline-directed medical therapies such as
statins, as observed in the current study. This creates a therapeutic
paradox: those at greatest risk are often deemed ineligible despite
potentially greater treatment benefits. While recent TASC (InterSociety Consensus for the Management of Peripheral Artery
Disease) guidelines emphasize secondary prevention beyond revascularization,23 there is often a delay adopting newer therapeutic strategies such as rivaroxaban in clinical practice. Several explanations for
this gap are worth considering. Meta-analyses of antiplatelet agents in
PAD suggest diminished efficacy relative to CAD patients,24 which
may lead to medical uncertainty. In addition, the landscape for combination antithrombotic therapy is complex. Vorapaxar appears efficacious when combined with both aspirin and clopidogrel but is
associated with increased major bleeding and intracranial haemorrhage.25 However, with the availability of more potent platelet P2Y12
inhibitors, such as prasugrel and ticagrelor, triple therapy may be considered unnecessary.26 Regardless, the totality of efficacy evidence
for low-dose rivaroxaban plus aspirin in CAD, PAD, and acute coronary syndrome appears favourable.12,13,27 Recent European data from
Sogaard and colleagues28 suggest modest temporal improvements in
guideline-directed secondary prevention therapy in PAD after LER,
with corresponding reductions in MALE. However, utilization patterns for a low-dose anticoagulant-antiplatelet regimen have not
been studied and no reduction in major amputation was observed in
Sogaard's study. This highlights the urgent need for novel strategies
to prevent major vascular amputations as supported by the current
VOYAGER PAD trial.

..
We acknowledge several limitations regarding the interpretation
..
.. and generalizability of our findings. The current analysis did not dem..
.. onstrate a statistically significant reduction in all-cause or cardiovas.. cular mortality, given limited patient numbers and a median follow-up
..
.. of 28 months. Nonetheless, the downstream implications of reduced
.. major amputation and ALI are a study strength, as these events por..
.. tend high healthcare costs and substantial morbidity including pro.. found disability after amputation. In addition, comparative results
..
.. with the COMPASS trial although remarkably consistent are limited
.. by an incomplete understanding of the anatomic and physiologic dif..
.. ferences in elderly vascular disease patients that are stable vs. those
.. more acutely requiring revascularization. Finally, although power to
..
.. demonstrate statistical significance with a P-value <0.05 is generally
..
.. limited in any subgroup analysis of a trial, the current analysis included
.. over 250 primary outcome events in over 1300 patients in the sub..
.. group of interest (>_75) and showed no evidence of heterogeneity
.. for treatment by age (P-interaction 0.83).
..
In conclusion, patients with PAD undergoing LER are at high risk of
..
.. ischaemic events and, particularly, severe limb complications such as
..
.. ALI and major amputation of a vascular aetiology. Rivaroxaban
.. 2.5 mg twice daily added to low-dose aspirin reduces this risk with
..
.. consistent benefit across the spectrum of age and potentially with
.. even greater benefit for reducing ALI in those >_75 years of age.
..
.. Rivaroxaban numerically increases TIMI major bleeding, but not intra..
.. cranial haemorrhage or fatal bleeding with no signal of increased
.. bleeding risk. Overall, rivaroxaban therapy is associated with a fa..
.. vourable benefit-risk profile regardless of age and should be consid.. ered even in PAD patients >_75 years of age.
