Aims

Coronary artery disease is frequently diagnosed following evaluation of stable chest pain with anatomical or functional testing. A more granular understanding of patient phenotypes that benefit from either strategy may enable
personalized testing.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
Using participant-level data from 9572 patients undergoing anatomical (n = 4734) vs. functional (n = 4838) testing in
the PROMISE (PROspective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain) trial, we created a topological
and results

representation of the study population based on 57 pre-randomization variables. Within each patient's 5% topological neighbourhood, Cox regression models provided individual patient-centred hazard ratios for major adverse
cardiovascular events and revealed marked heterogeneity across the phenomap [median 1.11 (10th to 90th percentile: 0.52-2.61]), suggestive of distinct phenotypic neighbourhoods favouring anatomical or functional testing.
Based on this risk phenomap, we employed an extreme gradient boosting algorithm in 80% of the PROMISE population to predict the personalized benefit of anatomical vs. functional testing using 12 model-derived, routinely collected variables and created a decision support tool named ASSIST (Anatomical vs. Stress teSting decIsion Support
Tool). In both the remaining 20% of PROMISE and an external validation set consisting of patients from SCOTHEART (Scottish COmputed Tomography of the HEART Trial) undergoing anatomical-first vs. functional-first
assessment, the testing strategy recommended by ASSIST was associated with a significantly lower incidence of
each study's primary endpoint (P = 0.0024 and P = 0.0321 for interaction, respectively), as well as a harmonized
endpoint of all-cause mortality or non-fatal myocardial infarction (P = 0.0309 and P < 0.0001 for interaction,
respectively).

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
We propose a novel phenomapping-derived decision support tool to standardize the selection of anatomical vs.
functional testing in the evaluation of stable chest pain, validated in two large and geographically diverse clinical trial
populations.

Introduction

Methods
Data source
We obtained participant-level data of the PROMISE trial through the
National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. Details of the PROMISE trial
have been previously published.4 Briefly, PROMISE (ClinicalTrials.gov
identifier: NCT01174550) recruited 10 003 patients from multiple
centres in the USA and Canada who were randomized to either anatomical (CTCA) or functional testing (including exercise electrocardiography,
nuclear stress testing, or stress echocardiography).4 The Yale Institutional
Review Board approved our study and waived the requirement for
informed consent for our post hoc analysis of de-identified data. SCOTHEART (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01149590) enrolled 4146
patients from 122 cardiology chest pain clinics across Scotland and

Nearly 200 million people globally suffer from coronary artery disease (CAD),1 half of whom initially present with chest pain.2 The optimal non-invasive diagnostic strategy for chest pain in patients with
suspected stable CAD is clinically important to define, yet remains
uncertain.3 PROMISE (PROspective Multicenter Imaging Study for
Evaluation of Chest Pain)4 and SCOT-HEART (Scottish COmputed
Tomography of the HEART Trial)5,6 have recently demonstrated
that anatomical imaging has comparable outcomes to stress testing
and may improve long-term outcomes when used in addition to
standard of care including stress testing. This allowed computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) to gain traction as an alternative to functional testing.7,8 However, the choice between these two
strategies remains arbitrary, despite over 14 000 randomized individuals across these large, well-conducted trials. This clinical equipoise is
evident in the recent European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines that assign a Class I recommendation to both CTCA and non-invasive functional testing as appropriate initial tests to diagnose CAD
in symptomatic patients.9
The PROMISE trial remains the largest randomized controlled trial
to have compared CTCA with functional testing in low-risk symptomatic patients with stable chest pain,4 and included 10 003 individuals followed for a median 25 months.4 However, subsequent analyses
have revealed evidence of heterogeneity across broad subgroups,
with women compared with men, and patients with diabetes compared with those without diabetes experiencing fewer adverse cardiovascular events with anatomical testing than with functional
testing.10-12
Nevertheless, broad subgroup assessments do not account for
large variation in demographic and clinical features within such subgroups. Therefore, there are no tools that support individualization
of the expected benefit of anatomical and functional testing based on
each patient's unique phenotype, which is essential for shared decision-making.
In this study, we developed a method that evaluates the phenotypic diversity of patients presenting with stable chest pain as well as
their optimal non-invasive testing strategy based on each patient's
unique set of pre-randomization characteristics, and subsequent outcomes, using individual patient data from two major clinical trials
investigating the clinical value of anatomical testing in the evaluation
of chest pain (Graphical abstract).

Personalizing chest pain testing

Individualized risk phenomapping

Extreme gradient boosting algorithm to
predict the benefit of anatomical testing
To translate the heterogeneity in treatment effect across the PROMISE
phenomap to a clinical population, we constructed an extreme gradient
boosting algorithm to predict the personalized risk of MACE with anatomical vs. functional testing (natural logarithm of the neighbourhood
HR) using variables, which were available in >_50% of participants in both
PROMISE and SCOT-HEART, spanning demographics, comorbidities, laboratory testing, vitals, and medications with implications for anatomical
or functional testing. This process yielded 21 variables including key
demographics (age, sex), risk factors (smoking, family history of CAD,
hypertension, diabetes mellitus, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, statin use), anthropometrics (BMI, systolic and diastolic blood pressure), cerebrovascular and peripheral vascular disease, ECG findings
(rhythm, Q waves, findings interfering with stress test interpretation, as
defined in PROMISE),4 and use of antiplatelets and beta-blockers.
We randomly divided the PROMISE population into training (80%,
n = 7660) and internal validation (20%, n = 1912) sets. Data pre-processing, parameter set-up, and hyperparameter tuning are described in the
Supplementary material online, Methods. Briefly, we trained the extreme
gradient boosting algorithm to identify patient characteristics that were
strongly associated with improved outcomes (patient-centred log-hazards) for anatomical or functional testing. We used root mean squared
error to evaluate our model performance, identified the optimal hyperparameters using a grid search, and implemented 10-fold cross-validation.
We evaluated feature importance using SHAP (SHapley Additive
exPlanations) values,19 which identify a predictor contribution, either
positively or negatively, to the prediction.
To improve the model practical application, we selected features that
were strongly associated with improved outcomes with either anatomical
or functional testing based on a feature importance of 0.03 or higher,
resulting in 12 features. We retrained our model using these limited set
of features, using 10-fold cross-validation in the 80% of PROMISE, followed by further validation in the remaining (unseen) 20% of PROMISE.

This machine learning-derived parsimonious model trained on 12 features represented ASSIST (Anatomical vs. Stress teSting decIsion
Support Tool). Negative ASSIST values (<0) predicted improved outcomes with anatomical-first assessment, whereas positive ASSIST values
(>0) favoured functional-first assessment.

External validation and performance of
ASSIST
We validated the decision support tool, ASSIST, externally in a selected
subset of SCOT-HEART that underwent anatomical-first vs. functionalfirst assessment. As the SCOT-HEART subset represented a selected
population with the potential for intervention and covariate imbalance, in
a sensitivity analysis, we created propensity score-matched subgroups of
patients undergoing anatomical or functional testing (Supplementary material online, Methods).

Statistical analyses
We compared the two treatment groups using Student's t-test for continuous variables and chi-square test for categorical variables and used
Pearson's correlation to assess continuous variables. We performed survival analyses using Cox proportional-hazards regression. While neighbourhoods were matched on pre-randomization covariates, we explicitly
adjusted Cox models for age and sex. We assessed the association of the
ASSIST recommended testing modality and outcomes through its groupwise interactions with the two treatment groups in Cox models.
Statistical tests were two-sided with a level of significance of 0.05.
Analyses were performed using R (version 4.0.2) and Python (version
3.8.5). Reporting of the study design and findings stands consistent with
the STROBE (Strengthening the reporting of observational studies in epidemiology) guidelines (see checklist in Supplementary material online,
Data).20

Results
Study population
From PROMISE, we included 9572 patients [age 60.3 +/- 8.3 years,
n = 5013 (52.4%) women] with stable chest pain. Of these, 4734
(49.5%) underwent CTCA and the remaining 4838 (50.5%) functional
testing (Figure 1A). Baseline characteristics were balanced between
the two study arms (Supplementary material online, Table S2). Over
a mean follow-up period of 2.1 +/- 0.9 years, there were 294 MACE
(primary study outcome), with no significant difference in the primary
outcome in the two arms [adjusted HR 1.03 (95% confidence interval
(CI): 0.82-1.29), P = 0.8159 for anatomical vs. functional testing].
In the external validation dataset from SCOT-HEART, 2135
patients [age 57.1 +/- 9.8 years, n = 949 (44.4%) women] underwent either anatomical testing alone (n = 301) or functional testing alone
(n = 1834) (Figure 1B, baseline characteristics in Supplementary material online, Table S3). Over an average follow-up of 4.8 +/- 1.1 years, a
total of 74 primary outcome events of coronary heart disease death
or non-fatal MI events were recorded [adjusted HR 0.63 (95% CI
0.29-1.37), P = 0.2411], an effect size consistent with the beneficial

Within each patient-centred neighbourhood, we assessed the association
of undergoing anatomical vs. functional testing with MACE in age- and
sex-adjusted Cox regression models, thus providing individualized risk
estimates based on each patient's unique neighbourhood. The natural
logarithmic transformations of the hazard ratio (HR) from the Cox models comparing anatomical and functional testing for each patient's topological neighbourhood represented their individualized effect estimate. In
our approach, negative log-HRs favour anatomical testing, whereas positive values favour functional testing.
Furthermore, since an unbiased personalized effect estimate is contingent upon the similarity of individuals in their topological neighbourhoods, we created a measure of neighbourhood homogeneity. This
represented the square of 1 minus the average pairwise distance between
the index patient and each one of their neighbours, with higher values
reflecting a neighbourhood of phenotypically more similar patients.
To visualize the phenotypic variation in the PROMISE population and
neighbourhoods we used uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP),18 which constructs a two-dimensional representation of
the high-dimensional feature space. We employed colour maps to visualize the topological distribution of the patient baseline demographics and
neighbourhood estimates in the phenomap.
We demonstrated the ability of our approach to detect heterogeneity
in treatment effects using examples of individuals sharing a key set of features (age, sex, traditional risk factors) but differing on other baseline
characteristics.

Phenomapping the stable chest pain in
PROMISE

Distribution of neighbourhood-based
individualized risk estimates
Patient-specific neighbourhoods for each of the 9572 included
PROMISE participants, included 5% of the population in their topological vicinity, with a wide distribution of neighbourhood-specific
risk effect estimates (Supplementary material online, Figure S2). The
median neighbourhood-specific HR for MACE was 1.11 with 10th,
25th, 75th, and 90th percentiles of 0.52, 0.76, 1.67, and 2.61, respectively. A projection of each person's individual effect estimate on the
phenomap suggested distinct topological neighbourhoods favouring
anatomical or functional testing (Figure 2C and D). There was also
variation in both the direction of the effect and the effect size for different endpoints across the topological space of the study
population.
In sensitivity analyses for variable neighbourhood sizes (2.5%, 5%,
7.5%, 10%, 15% of the study population), an increasing neighbourhood size was associated with a narrower distribution of individual
risk estimates around the average treatment effect across the cohort
(HR 1.03), representing loss of risk heterogeneity observed at larger
neighbourhood sizes. The larger neighbourhood, however, also compared dissimilar individuals with decreasing neighbourhood homogeneity based on increasing mean distances (Supplementary material
online, Figure S3). Random iterations for various neighbourhood sizes
between 2.5% and 10% showed that the average effect size
was strongly correlated with that derived from 5% neighbourhoods
[r = 0.72 (95% CI 0.71-0.73)] (Supplementary material online,
Figure S4).

Using risk phenomap for individualized
risk prediction
To demonstrate an example of individualized risk estimation using
the phenomap, we identified a subset of three phenotypically similar
PROMISE participants, each of them a 59-year-old woman, with a history of diabetes and hypertension but not smoking, presenting with
atypical chest pain and a modified pre-test Diamond-Forrester score
of 20%. Despite the above similarities, phenomapping using all 57
included variables (Supplementary material online, Table S4) revealed
that these patients were located in distinct topological neighbourhoods (Figure 3A). Each patient's neighbourhood-specific assessments
identified differential risk/benefit associated with anatomical vs. functional testing, ranging from improved outcomes with functional testing (Figure 3B) to similar outcomes with either strategy (Figure 3C), or
improved outcomes with anatomical imaging (Figure 3D). Of note,

each patient neighbourhood had phenotypically similar patients in
the two study arms (Supplementary material online, Table S5).

The Anatomical vs. Stress teSting
decIsion Support Tool (ASSIST)
In the 80% training set from PROMISE (n = 7660), an extreme gradient boosting algorithm identified hypertension, diabetes mellitus, use
of beta-blockers, female sex, statin use, smoking history, antiplatelet
use, BMI, age, and cholesterol levels as the predictors with highest
feature importance for relative hazard of MACE with anatomic or
functional testing (Figure 4A). Feature importance analysis suggested
that female sex, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, use of beta-blockers,
and active or former smoking were each associated with improved
outcomes with anatomical testing (Figure 4B), whereas absence of
these risk factors as well as lower BMI and statin use favoured functional testing. Our clinical decision support tool, ASSIST, represents
the extreme gradient model developed using these 12 most important features. Hold-out validation performance of the parsimonious
12-feature tool was comparable with that of a model relying on all 21
inputs (RMSE of 0.59 vs. 0.57, respectively), while logistically easier to
deploy.
Of note, in both the cross-validated training and testing sets of
PROMISE, there was no association between the ASSIST risk prediction and the allocation to either anatomical or functional testing, consistent with the random allocation to the two arms (Figure 4C and D).

Internal and external validation of
ASSIST
In the remaining 20% PROMISE participants (n = 1912, internal validation; Figure 5), as well as in the selected unmatched and propensity
score-matched population of SCOT-HEART (external validation;
Figure 6), the ASSIST performed well in identifying the favoured diagnostic strategy. In both the internal and external validation sets,
agreement between the ASSIST recommendation (score >0: favouring functional, score <0: favouring anatomical) and the actual test performed was associated with a significantly lower incidence of each
primary composite endpoint (Figures 5A-C and 6A-C, respectively) as
well as the harmonized endpoint of all-cause mortality and non-fatal
MI (Figures 5D-F and 6D-F, respectively), with consistent significant
interaction between the ASSIST-recommended test and performed
strategy (Figures 5 and 6). Findings demonstrated a dose-response relationship in a pooled analysis of the two cohorts (Supplementary
material online, Figure S5) and were also robust to a sensitivity analysis for all-cause mortality (Supplementary material online, Figure
S6). Of note, a post hoc analysis of individual risk factors in the external validation set did not identify patients more likely to have favourable outcomes with anatomical vs. functional testing (Pinteraction =
0.7925 for sex, 0.3450 for hypertension, and 0.8474 for diabetes
mellitus).

Discussion
In the largest clinical trial to have evaluated the role of CTCA in the
investigation of stable chest pain, we developed and validated a machine learning-based decision support tool to guide the selection between anatomical and functional evaluation. We defined a novel

We first created a phenomap of our study population using a pairwise dissimilarity metric derived from 57 pre-randomization phenotypic characteristics and visualized it as a two-dimensional manifold
representation. Based on visual assessment, the two treatment arms
were distributed uniformly throughout the phenotypic space, consistent with their random allocation across the population (Figure 2A)
with varying baseline clinical factors and risk of CAD (Figure 2B).

strategy that constructs a high-dimensional phenotypic representation of trial participants, permitting a series of local experiments
within the trial uncovering heterogeneous treatment effects, identifying individuals who may derive benefit from one strategy over
another. Our approach synthesizes the complex relationship between a large number of pre-randomization characteristics in creating and visualizing a comprehensive phenomap of patients, with
an individualized assessment of the risk of adverse cardiovascular
events with anatomical or functional testing for assessing chest
pain. Our new machine learning-derived tool (ASSIST) based on
12 widely available clinical parameters derived from risk phenomaps reliably and consistently identified patients who were more

likely to have improved outcomes when assigned to an anatomical
or functional diagnostic strategy.
To date, there has been no consensus on the strategy to choose
between anatomical and functional testing in chest pain evaluation,21
and different clinical practice guidelines provide varying levels and
strengths of recommendation on the use of CTCA vs. functional testing.8,9,22,23 Despite PROMISE and SCOT-HEART, identifying a population that may benefit from CTCA or functional testing has been
mostly supported through post hoc analyses in large population subgroups, specifically women,10 and patients with diabetes,11 and considerations about CTCA test characteristics, including high
sensitivity,24 but limited specificity in detecting haemodynamically

explores the factors associated with the relative benefit obtained
from anatomical vs. functional testing.
Our study uses a novel approach to achieve these goals. Our
approach leverages the detailed phenotypic characterization of
clinical trial populations at enrolment and the unbiased treatment
allocation to infer a personalized treatment effect. Therefore, it
provides a quantitative evaluation of the heterogeneity of outcomes, and an assessment whether the average treatment effect

observed in a clinical trial setting applies to a given trial participant.
We also created a visual representation of differences across individuals enrolled in a clinical trial, allowing interpretability of different patients and the observed effects. Our approach builds upon
prior studies that have employed clustering to demonstrate clinical
trial participants have discordant effects.26-29 However, they are
limited in clinical application as they ultimately represent broad
subgroups of patients that differ from each other on many

Figure 4 Developing a decision support tool to predict individualized benefit from anatomical vs. functional testing in chest pain investigation. (A)
In a randomly selected sample of the PROMISE population, we trained an extreme gradient boosting tree to predict the phenomap-derived individualized risk with anatomical vs. functional testing. We identified the most important input features based on the SHAP values and selected the top 12
predictors (all with feature importance of 0.03 or higher) to create an easy-to-use clinical support tool, named ASSIST. (B) To offer some insight into
each variable contribution, we used a SHAP summary plot, in which the y-axis represents the variables in descending order of importance and the xaxis indicates the change in prediction. The gradient colour denotes the original value for that variable (for instance for Booleans such as hypertension
or diabetes it only takes two colours, whereas for continuous variables it contains the whole spectrum), with each point representing an individual
from the original training set. Negative SHAP values (x-axis) indicate improved outcomes with anatomical imaging (as seen among individuals with
hypertension and diabetes) whereas positive values indicate improved outcomes with functional testing. (C and D) Notably, ASSIST predictions were
independent of the random assignment to the anatomical or functional testing group in both the training and testing sets of PROMISE. ASSIST,

characteristics, thereby limiting a personalized treatment selection.
In our approach, each individual represents the centre of their
own cluster and, therefore, is compared with similar individuals in
inferring a treatment effect.
In addition, our machine learning-based decision support tool,
ASSIST, allows such personalization of the diagnostic strategy for
chest pain using only 12 key variables. The tool (which is available online,30 also see Supplementary material online, Figure S7) consistently

demonstrated a lower rate of all-cause mortality and adverse cardiovascular outcomes where the diagnostic strategy was aligned with
ASSIST recommendation. Moreover, these findings were replicated
in the SCOT-HEART study, which included a geographically and
phenotypically distinct population. Notably, previously suggested
broad demographic and clinical groups that may benefit from anatomical evaluation10,11 were not generalizable to the external
population.

SCOT-HEART used for external validation purposes confirmed that concordance (vs. disagreement) between the ASSIST-proposed best initial diagnostic strategy and a patient allocation to anatomical-first imaging vs. standard of care (which included functional-first testing) was associated with a
reduction in the risk of the study primary composite endpoint (A-C), as well as the harmonized composite endpoint of all-cause mortality and nonfatal myocardial infarction (D and E). ASSIST, Anatomical vs. Stress teSting decIsion Support Tool; SCOT-HEART, Scottish COmputed Tomography

Our study should be interpreted in light of the following limitations. First, our approach does not offer a mechanistic explanation
for the differential effect of testing strategy on outcomes. Both trials
did not require a fixed treatment cascade that follows each strategy,
and differences in clinical endpoints likely reflect medical and

procedural interventions that follow these tests. A validation in two
distinct cohorts suggests consistency in the observation and generalizability of our findings; however, treatment strategies deviating from
PROMISE and SCOT-HEART may not find a similar effect. Second,
our study is a post hoc analysis, and therefore, our findings are

Conclusion
We have developed an approach that defines an evidence-based
strategy to pursue anatomical or functional evaluation of patients
with suspected CAD. The approach uses a series of local experiments in a multidimensional phenomap of trial participants to infer a
personalized strategy of the diagnostic evaluation approach most
likely to achieve the best outcomes. Furthermore, a generalizable decision support tool derived from this phenomap, and validated in two
geographically distinct large studies, enables a broader use of this information in shared decision-making in clinical practice.

descriptive and only represent a way to interpret trial data. While
randomization was not fully preserved, the treatment allocation itself
was not driven by clinical indications and diagnostic strategies were
assigned as part of the trial protocol. This overcomes the limitation
of other observational studies based on real-world data, which are
often subject to confounding by indication. However, our findings do
highlight heterogeneity in risks and benefits of anatomical and functional testing, and a significant interaction between the test received
and a patient baseline profile suggests that ASSIST accurately identified individuals for whom anatomical or functional testing may have
differential outcome implications. Therefore, ASSIST may aid patient
discussions, particularly at centres where both tests are similarly accessible. To this end, future validation in unselected cohorts will be
crucial. Third, SCOT-HEART had a different design than PROMISE,
with the majority (85%) of patients in the computed tomography
coronary angiography arm undergoing baseline exercise ECG (rather
than nuclear imaging), whereas as the standard of care control arm
did not explicitly require functional testing.5 We harmonized the
diagnostic testing in SCOT-HEART to PROMISE to allow its use as a
validation study, and explicitly conducted a matched analysis of
SCOT-HEART participants with equal propensity of undergoing anatomical or functional testing as their first test. However, this process
resulted in loss of randomization and the conclusions of the study
would not be generalizable to the strategy assessed in the overall
SCOT-HEART population, which demonstrated the benefit of anatomical imaging when used in addition to rather than as an alternative
to functional testing.5,6 Finally, while missing data were imputed only
if missing in a minority of the included patients, imputation may limit
the accuracy of some of our study estimates.
