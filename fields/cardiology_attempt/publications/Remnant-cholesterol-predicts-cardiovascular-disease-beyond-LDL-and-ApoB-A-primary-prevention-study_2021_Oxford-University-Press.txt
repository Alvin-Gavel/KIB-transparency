Aims

Emerging evidence suggests that remnant cholesterol (RC) promotes atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease
(ASCVD). We aimed to estimate RC-related risk beyond low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and apolipoprotein B (apoB) in patients without known ASCVD.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
We pooled data from 17 532 ASCVD-free individuals from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study
and results
(n = 9748), the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (n = 3049), and the Coronary Artery Risk Development in

Young Adults (n = 4735). RC was calculated as non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) minus calculated LDL-C. Adjusted Cox models were used to estimate the risk for incident ASCVD associated with log RC
levels. We also performed discordance analyses examining relative ASCVD risk in RC vs. LDL-C discordant/concordant groups using difference in percentile units (>10 units) and clinically relevant LDL-C targets. The mean age
of participants was 52.3 +/- 17.9 years, 56.7% were women and 34% black. There were 2143 ASCVD events over
the median follow-up of 18.7 years. After multivariable adjustment including LDL-C and apoB, log RC was associated with higher ASCVD risk [hazard ratio (HR) 1.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.45-1.89]. Moreover, the discordant high RC/low LDL-C group, but not the low RC/high LDL-C group, was associated with increased ASCVD
risk compared to the concordant group (HR 1.21, 95% CI 1.08-1.34). Similar results were shown when examining
discordance across clinical cutpoints.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusions
In ASCVD-free individuals, elevated RC levels were associated with ASCVD independent of traditional risk factors,

LDL-C, and apoB levels. The mechanisms of RC association with ASCVD, surprisingly beyond apoB, and the potential value of targeted RC-lowering in primary prevention need to be further investigated.

Introduction
Pharmacological lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol
(LDL-C), primarily via statin therapy, has an unequivocal impact on
the reduction of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (ASCVD). 1
However, significant residual cardiovascular risk has been reported
among statin-treated individuals, even with otherwise low LDL-C
levels.2,3
Continuous efforts have been made to identify strategies to approach residual risk.4,5 Given the failure of high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (HDL-C) raising therapies in reducing ASCVD events,6,7
the research focus has swung to triglycerides (TG) and triglyceriderich lipoproteins (TGRL), which have been associated with the development of ASCVD.8-13 Remnant particles are TGRL that have been
partially lipolyzed by the action of lipoprotein lipase; they circulate in
plasma and accumulate in the subendothelial space,14,15 contributing
to endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and ultimately atherogenesis.16,17 About one third of the cholesterol load carried by apolipoprotein B (apoB) containing lipoprotein particles is transported via
remnant particles in non-fasting conditions.18 Mounting evidence
from Mendelian randomization studies has established the cholesterol content in remnant particles to be causally associated with ischaemic heart disease,19,20 and most recently with the risk of aortic

Study design
We conducted a study pooling individual-level data from the three
cohorts. For the present analysis, the baseline visit was defined as the
time of lipid and apolipoprotein measurement in each cohort: Visit 1 in
MESA (years 2000-2002), Visit 1 in CARDIA (year 1985), and Visit 4 in
ARIC (1996-98). End of follow-up time was 31 December 2013 for
MESA, 31, December 2011 for CARDIA, and 31, December 2016 for
ARIC.

Study population
All participants from baseline visits were screened for inclusion. Of them,
we excluded individuals with prevalent ASCVD at baseline (n = 1292), in
addition to those with missing values for lipids or apolipoproteins
(n = 2213), information regarding outcomes and/or follow-up times
(n = 6). To increase homogeneity of our study population, we only
included Whites and Blacks; therefore, we excluded Hispanics (n = 1496)
and Chinese (n = 803) from MESA, and those who were neither black
nor white from ARIC (n = 69).

Lipid measurements
In ARIC, total cholesterol (TC) and TG were determined by enzymatic
methods, and HDL-C was measured after dextran-magnesium precipitation (https://www2.cscc.unc.edu/aric/cohort-manuals). ApoB was measured using World Health Organization/International Federation of
Clinical Chemistry (WHO/IFCC) standardized reference materials [intracoefficient of variation (CV): 2.1%, inter-CV: 4.5%]. In CARDIA, TC and
HDL-C were measured using serum from a fasting blood draw that was
separated into plasma frozen at -70 C before analysis in a central laboratory. ApoB was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (intraCV: <5%). In MESA, fasting blood samples were collected and stored at
-70 C. Lipids were measured on eDTA plasma at a central laboratory
within approximately 2 weeks of collection. TC was measured via cholesterol oxidase methods, and TG were measured using TG GB on a Roche
COBAS FARA centrifugal analyser (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN,
USA). HDL-C was quantified by cholesterol oxidase methods after precipitation of non-HDL-C by magnesium/dextran (Roche Diagnostics).
ApoB was quantified using the Tina-quant apoB ver.2 immunoassay on a
Roche Modular P analyser (Roche Diagnostics) (intra-CV: <5%, inter-CV:
<5%). High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) was only available in
ARIC and MESA and was measured by the immunoturbidimetric assay
using the BNII analyser (Dade Behring, Deerfield, IL).
Since the Friedewald equation is known to underestimate LDL-C in
the presence of hypertriglyceridaemia,26 we used the Martin/Hopkins
equation. This method estimates LDL-C using 1 of 180 different factors
for the TG to very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) ratio
according to non-HDL-C and TG levels27 and has been externally validated by groups inside and outside the US.28-30 Levels of RC were estimated as TC minus HDL-C minus calculated LDL-C. Although currently
there is no standard method to estimate RC, this equation has been

.. frequently used in previous studies because it is available from the stand..
.. ard lipid profile.8,24,31 Furthermore, we have previously demonstrated
.. that using Martin/Hopkins LDL-C in the equation provides a more accur..
.. ate estimate of RC than using Friedewald LDL-C.32 Non-HDL-C was cal.. culated as TC minus HDL-C.
..
..
.. Discordance definition
..
.. As there is no physiological cutpoint for discordance between different
.. lipid or lipoprotein measures, we used different approaches to define dis.. cordance. First, we defined discordance using >10 difference in percentile
..
.. units (RC percentile minus LDL-C percentile). The population was div.. ided into: (i) RC percentile < LDL-C percentile (discordantly low RC) by
..
.. >10 percentile units; (ii) concordant RC and LDL-C within +/-10 percent.. ile units; and (iii) RC percentile > LDL-C percentile (discordantly high
.. RC) by >10 percentile units. We also used several clinical cutpoints to
..
.. define discordance and to assess the robustness of our findings. Although
.. existing literature has used medians as cutpoints,33-36 we focused on clin..
.. ically relevant LDL-C cutpoints (70, 100, and 130 mg/dL) that were
.. obtained from worldwide guideline recommendations.37-39 Respective
..
.. RC cutpoints were identified using equivalent population percentiles
.. from the pooled cohort corresponding to these LDL-C values.
..
..
.. Other covariates
.. Demographics (age, sex, race/ethnicity) and cardiovascular risk factors
..
.. were obtained from history, physical examination, and laboratory data at
.. each visit selected as baseline for our study. Body mass index (BMI) was
..
.. calculated as the weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in
.. metres. Smoking status was similarly categorized in each cohort as never,
.. former, and current smoker. Diabetes mellitus was defined as a fasting
..
.. (>_8 h) serum glucose >_126 mg/dL, non-fasting glucose >_200 mg/dL, self.. reported physician diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, or use of hypoglycaemic
..
.. agents. Blood pressure (BP) was measured three times, and the mean of
.. the second and third measurements was used in MESA and CARDIA,
..
.. whereas it was measured two times and the mean of both measurements
.. was used in ARIC. Hypertension was defined as self-reported physician
.. diagnosis of hypertension or reported use of antihypertensive medica..
.. tions. Use of lipid-lowering and antihypertensive medications was self.. reported.
..
..
.. Study outcomes
..
.. Details on the event ascertainment methods used in each cohort have
.. been reported previously and were similar across studies. The primary
.. outcome was incident ASCVD determined from hospital discharge codes
..
.. or death certificates. Incident ASCVD was similarly defined in the three
.. cohorts as definite or probable myocardial infarction, definite coronary
..
.. death, and definite or probable stroke. In addition, ARIC investigators
.. conducted continuous surveillance for all cardiovascular disease-related
..
.. hospitalizations and deaths. All ASCVD events were adjudicated by the
.. ARIC study investigators. Study participants contributed follow-up time
.. from the date of the participant's baseline visit until the date of incident
..
.. ASCVD event, death, loss to follow-up, or the administrative censoring at
.. December 31, 2016, whichever came first. For CARDIA, incident
..
.. ASCVD events were recorded through September 2011. Medical
.. records were requested for participants who had been hospitalized or
.. received an outpatient revascularization procedure. Two physician mem..
.. bers of the CARDIA endpoints surveillance and adjudication committee
.. independently classified events and assigned incident dates. If they dis..
.. agreed, the full committee made the final decision. For MESA, event data
.. were collected through follow-up telephone calls, patient information at
.. MESA visits, and medical records. Two independent physicians, blinded
..
. to participant data, served as adjudicators.40

Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA). The cohorts data are
available to qualifying investigators directly from the study. These cohorts
were included to increase precision and generalizability of our findings. In
addition, they share key features that were particularly helpful for this
study such as non-clinical referral, inclusion of mostly primary prevention
US individuals, and full lipid and apolipoprotein measurements, such as
apoB and apolipoprotein A1 (apoA1). The respective study protocols
were approved by the institutional review committee of each of the sites
participating in each of the studies. Institutional review boards at all participating institutions approved the three studies. All participants provided
written informed consent at each study visit.

a
hsCRP data only available in ARIC and MESA.

Statistical analyses
Baseline characteristics of the study population by concordance/discordance categories between LDL-C vs. RC were described using medians
(25th-75th percentiles) for continuous and proportions for categorical
variables. Comparisons were performed using Kruskal-Wallis test and
chi-squared test, respectively, between the four categories.
For our prospective analysis, we constructed nested Cox proportional
hazard models to assess the independent association between continuous log-transformed RC levels (given non-normal distribution) and incident ASCVD. Model 1 was adjusted by age, sex, race/ethnicity, smoking
status, systolic BP (SBP), use of antihypertensive and lipid-lowering medications. Model 2 was additionally adjusted by apoB, and Model 3 was further adjusted by apoA1. Additional models (Supplementary material
online) included non-HDL-C, HDL-C and hsCRP (available only in ARIC
and MESA). We incorporated apoA1 in the model in order to explore if
the observed association was independent of apoA1 particles, therefore
avoiding potential over-adjustment that may result from using HDL-C
given the known close association between estimated RC and both TG
and HDL-C.41 Furthermore, baseline variables that are known to be in
the causal pathway for increase in RC levels, such as obesity (i.e. BMI) and
diabetes were not included in the models.
Using the same models, we assessed the association between RC and
LDL-C concordant/discordant groups and incident ASCVD using

difference in percentile units, LDL-C clinical cutpoints and medians. We
also explored discordance in a continuous manner, defined as standardized difference in percentile units (RC percentile minus LDL-C percentile), adjusted for traditional risk factors in addition to apolipoproteins. In
an exploratory analysis, we also performed discordance analyses between RC vs. apoB medians.
To explore whether our findings varied by individual cohorts, we performed continuous analyses stratified by race (Blacks and Whites), as well
as by study/cohort (ARIC, CARDIA, and MESA). We additionally
explored both components of the primary outcome (myocardial infarction/coronary death and stroke) separately.
Finally, we performed sensitivity analyses excluding individuals on statin
therapy at baseline (n = 1148), and an additional model adjusting for
hsCRP only in ARIC and MESA individuals as this was available only in this
cohort.

non-HDL-C: 140 mg/dL, apoB: 97 mg/dL. The proportion of discordance between RC and LDL-C was 69.8% (35.6% had discordantly
low RC, and 34.2% had discordantly high RC).
Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of the study population
by concordant/discordant categories between LDL-C and RC.
Individuals with discordantly high RC had older age, higher BMI and
SBP, as well as greater proportion of diabetes and use of cholesterollowering and antihypertensive medications (P < 0.001) compared to
those with concordant and discordantly low RC, in addition to
greater levels of TG but lower levels of HDL-C. Importantly, those
with discordantly high RC had lower non-HDL-C and apoB levels
compared to those with discordantly low RC.
Over a median follow-up of 18.7 years (25th-75th percentiles
13.9-24.7), there were 2143 incident ASCVD events. In our continuous analysis, we observed a significant association between log RC
levels with incident ASCVD after adjusting for LDL-C in addition to
several traditional cardiovascular risk factors. This association
remained significant after including apoB (HR 1.65; 95% CI 1.45-1.89)
and apoA1 (HR 1.59; 95% CI 1.39-1.82) in the model (Table 2).
Notably, log RC continued to be associated with incident ASCVD
despite adjusting for non-HDL-C, although significance was attenuated after additional adjustment for HDL-C (Supplementary material
online, Table S1). In contrast, the association between log LDL-C and
ASCVD was lost after adjusting for apoB as expected (Table 2).
Approximately one third of individuals (34.2%) were in the high
RC/low LDL-C discordance group. Compared to the concordant
group, these individuals had a significant increase in ASCVD risk after
adjusting for traditional cardiovascular risk factors. This increase
remained significant after adjusting for apoB (HR 1.21; 95% CI 1.08-
1.34) and apoA1 (HR 1.19; 95% CI 1.07-1.34) (Table 3). On the other
hand, those in the low RC/high LDL-C discordant group had similar
ASCVD risk compared to the concordant group.

At lower LDL-C clinical cutpoints, the proportion of individuals
with high RC/low LDL-C discordance increased dramatically, up
to 81% in those with LDL-C < 70 mg/dL (Figure 1) and was associated with increased relative ASCVD risk (Table 4), although with
lower precision given smaller sample size and fewer number of
events in each category. We found similar results when using
medians to define discordance (Supplementary material online,
Table S2).
In a discordance continuous analysis, we observed a 15% increase
(HR 1.15; 95% CI 1.09-1.20) in ASCVD for every 1 SD (29 percentile units) increase in the percentile unit difference between RC
and LDL-C, after adjusting for several cardiovascular risk factors in
addition to apoB (Supplementary material online, Table S3). We
observed similar findings in all analyses when excluding individuals on
lipid-lowering therapy at baseline (Supplementary material online,
Table S4).
Finally, to further evaluate the independent contribution of RC
from total apoB atherogenic risk, we performed a supplementary
analysis showing that among individuals with apoB < median, those
with discordant RC >_ median had significantly increased risk of incident ASCVD (HR 1.30; 95% CI 1.13-1.49) (Supplementary material
online, Table S5).
Of note, results were consistent when stratifying our study
population by race (Supplementary material online, Table S6)
and by study/cohort with the exception of MESA. The lack of association in MESA could be explained by its relatively smaller
sample size and shorter duration of follow-up compared to
CARDIA and ARIC (Supplementary material online, Table S7).
Finally, we observed that our results were consistent when
examining individual endpoints of our primary outcome (stroke
and myocardial infarction/coronary death) (Supplementary material online, Table S8).

Discussion
In a diverse, representative and large population composed of three
community-based US cohorts followed for more than 18 years, we
found that (i) elevated RC levels were associated with risk of incident
ASCVD independent of traditional cardiovascular risk factors, LDLC, and apoB and (ii) those with high RC/low LDL-C, but not low RC/
high LDL-C, discordance were associated with increased ASCVD
risk in fully adjusted models including apoB compared to those with
concordance (Graphical abstract) . Our findings suggest that identifying
RC-related residual risk, in addition to LDL-C and apoB-related risk,
is clinically relevant as we usher in a new era of targeted lipidlowering therapies. Future studies are needed to identify novel mechanisms that explain the association of RC with ASCVD independent
of total atherogenic particle burden, and whether lowering its levels
improves clinical outcomes.
When there is overproduction of TGRLs42 (VLDL from the liver
and chylomicrons from the gut), less efficient lipolysis by lipoprotein
lipase (LPL) tends to occur leading to accumulation of partially
metabolized remnant particles. On a particle-for-particle basis, these
remnant particles have similar atherogenic potential to that of LDL
particles23 but carry 40 times more cholesterol.43 Remnant particles can be transported across the endothelial cell as opposed to
chylomicrons and VLDL particles, which are significantly larger.44
Furthermore, remnant particles have unique physicochemical characteristics that confer highly atherogenic properties. Due to the electrostatic interaction between their apolipoproteins (apoB and
apolipoprotein E) and matrix proteoglycans, remnant particles are

..
.. selectively retained in the subintimal space and efflux slowly in rela.. tion to their rates of entry.45 In addition to atherogenesis due to chol..
.. esterol deposition similar to LDL particles, apolipoprotein E also
.. mediates the receptor-mediated endocytosis of remnants by surface
..
.. receptors of subendothelial monocyte-derived macrophages, which
.. leads to foam cell formation and subsequent inflammatory response
..
.. contributory for atherosclerosis.46-49
..
..
.. RC atherogenic risk independent of apoB
.. It has been postulated that the atherogenic risk attributed to rem..
.. nant, LDL, and lipoprotein(a) particles is reflected within total apoB
.. particle concentration. A Mendelian randomization study showed
..
.. that LPL and LDL receptor variants associated with lower TG and
..
.. LDL levels, respectively, were linked with a similarly lower risk of cor.. onary heart disease per unit difference in apoB.23 This suggested that
..
.. the clinical benefit of lowering either TG, a surrogate for RC, or LDL
.. levels is proportional to the absolute change in apoB.23 On the other
..
.. hand, a recent study in a pooled cohort of intravascular ultrasound
.. trials of patients with known coronary artery disease showed that
..
.. on-treatment and changes in RC levels were linked to coronary ath.. eroma progression after adjusting for apoB.24 Reaffirming the latter
..
.. observations, we demonstrate here in individuals without known
.. ASCVD that RC levels are associated with incident ASCVD in fully
..
.. adjusted models including LDL-C and apoB. Discordance analyses
.. also show that participants with discordantly high RC/low LDL-C or
..
.. apoB had higher risk of incident ASCVD when compared to those
.. with concordance. This increased risk was not observed in those
..
. with low RC/high LDL-C discordance.

These observations suggest that the cholesterol content of remnants may modify ASCVD risk information beyond the total atherogenic particle burden. Several hypotheses may explain the
mechanisms behind this association. First, RC may be handled differently than LDL-C within macrophages and vascular walls.25 Second,
increased levels of RC may be associated with increased TG enrichment of LDL particles, particularly TG-enriched small dense LDL particles that tend to be atherogenic and stay longer in circulation.47
Third, RC levels could indirectly echo the activity of key plasma lipid
regulatory proteins such as apolipoprotein C3 (apoC3) or
angiopoietin-like protein 3 (ANGPTL3), which may be independent
of the single apoB equatorial moiety encircling TGRLs.41
Another observation worth discussing is that, in an exploratory
analysis of a subset of our pooled cohort, RC remained an independent predictor of ASCVD events after additionally adjusting for hsCRP
levels, despite previous evidence suggesting that RC contributes to
atherosclerosis by inducing low-grade inflammation and proinflammatory endothelial activation.48

RC in cardiovascular risk assessment and
primary prevention
HDL-C and TG concentrations are inversely related through reverse
cholesterol transport,50 and for many years, the former has been presumed to be the causal partner in ASCVD.41 However, recent studies have suggested that there is a U-shaped association between
HDL-C and ASCVD that could be partially explained by lipolysis of
TGRLs by LPL and the transfer of free cholesterol to HDL-C.51
Moreover, recent genetic studies and HDL-C raising drug trials have
cast doubt over the causal role of HDL-C levels in ASCVD turning
the tide towards TGRLs; their cholesterol content is thought to be

the causal culprit rather than TG, which are degraded by most cells
and do not accumulate within vascular walls.42 But if RC is included
within non-HDL-C, does it provide additional value to risk assessment? In our continuous analysis, we show that elevated RC levels
remained associated with ASCVD even after adjusting for non-HDLC. These observations were replicated in percentile discordance
analyses where we showed that the risk of ASCVD increased as the
magnitude of discordance between RC and LDL-C percentiles
increased even after adjusting for non-HDL-C; incident ASCVD
increased by 10% for every th29 percentile units difference between
RC and LDL-C. This observation suggests that elevated levels of RC,
regardless of total non-HDL-C level, may indirectly reflect risk information related to other atherogenic mechanisms such as increased
apoC3 or ANGPTL3 activity rather than the risk captured in the
cholesterol content of remnant particles. ApoC3 has been proposed
to have proatherogenic properties mediated by heterogeneous
mechanisms such as inhibiting LPL, impeding the clearance of remnant lipoproteins by the liver, and promoting inflammation and endothelial cell apoptosis.41 Several genetic studies of individuals with
apoC3 loss-of-function mutations have shown lifelong reduction in
TG and RC levels and a lower incidence of ASCVD.52,53 Our findings
suggest that RC-related risk, which may reflect more complex underlying atherogenic processes, is not fully captured within non-HDL-C
levels. In other words, the relative contributions of RC and LDL-C to
non-HDL-C add risk information that is not inherently captured
within the simple sum of the two measures. This evidence may
support the use of RC levels in residual risk assessment in primary
prevention beyond non-HDL-C, especially when discordant with
LDL-C.
As newer generation TG or RC lowering therapies, such as apoC3
and ANGPTL3 inhibitors,54 are being evaluated in contemporary

Remnant cholesterol and ASCVD

Strengths and limitations
Our study has several strengths. First, we were able to show the independent predictive power of RC as a continuous measure, but also
its additional conferred risk by using a discordance analysis. Second,
by pooling data from three landmark representative US cohorts, our
results are more generalizable than epidemiological studies counterparts. Third, we used a variety of clinical cutpoints to define discordance, which showed robustness of our findings. Fourth, we used the
Martin/Hopkins equation for estimation of LDL-C, which yields more
accurate estimates of RC than using the Friedewald equation.32 Fifth,

this study provide carefully documented outcomes ascertained by independent adjudication committees, which makes our results more
reliable.
As with all observational studies, we cannot exclude the possibility
of residual confounding. Although the length of follow-up is a
strength, there may be significant volatility in lipid levels that fluctuate
over time. In addition, the difference in decades of enrollment between each cohort (10-15 years) adds a potential source of bias
given that individuals from later enrolment visits (ARIC and MESA)
were probably more likely to have been started on lipid-lowering
therapies than those enrolled earlier (CARDIA). Given the primary
prevention nature of our pooled cohort with median LDL-C of
118 mg/dL, our estimates-although significant-were not precise
among those with LDL-C levels <70 mg/dL. Furthermore, although
the Martin/Hopkins equation performs significantly better than
Friedewald's in this LDL-C range, it still has some inherent inaccuracy.57 Some studies have shown that postprandial TG and RC levels
were more strongly associated with ASCVD compared with fasting
levels. Therefore, the atherogenic risk driven by fasting RC levels in
our study may underestimate the total RC risk. However, the use of
fasting RC levels ensured standardization across all three study
cohorts. Dedicated studies comparing the atherogenic risk of fasting
vs. non-fasting RC levels are needed. Type III hyperlipidaemia is a rare
disorder characterized by extremely elevated RC levels. It is worthwhile noting that, similar to findings from the general population,5,35
the prevalence of this disorder was 1.9% in our pooled cohort for
which we deduce that most results were not driven by the presence
of this disorder. Our data may have also been confounded by the failure to measure lipoprotein(a) levels and to correct LDL-C and apoB
values for this parameter. Finally, methodologies for apoB measurements were not the same in each cohort. Although the distribution
of apoB was different across the three cohorts, so was the distribution for LDL-C and non-HDL-C, which was likely a result of different
inherent characteristics of each population (Supplementary material
online, Table S9). Finally, we observed no evidence for assay drift (i.e.
shift in slope or y-intercept) when plotting apoB vs. non-HDL-C levels in the overall population stratified by cohort (Supplementary material online, Figures S1 and S2) and their correlation was strong
(Spearman correlation coefficient >0.85) in all cohorts.

Conclusions
In a representative pooled cohort of US individuals free of ASCVD,
levels of RC were associated with ASCVD independent of traditional
cardiovascular risk factors, LDL-C, and non-HDL-C or apoB levels.
These associations were expectedly attenuated by adjusting for
HDL-C; however, identifying RC residual risk may be more pragmatic
as we usher in a new era of targeted RC or TG lowering therapies
and given the recent failure of HDL-C boosting therapies. Advancing
the use of RC in routine clinical practice requires reaching consensus
on the best and most cost-effective method to measure RC. Future
studies are needed to demonstrate the mechanisms by which RC is
independently associated with ASCVD beyond total atherogenic particle concentration and to determine whether RC lowering to specific targets is associated with cardiovascular benefit.

clinical trials, transitioning into a new approach that considers the individual components of non-HDL-C may be the way to move forward. Rather than a one-size-fits-all approach to managing elevated
non-HDL-C, or apoB, levels, estimating LDL-C and RC levels from
the standard lipid profile can help guide the use of different combinations of lipid-lowering therapies. For example, a very high-risk patient
on high-dose statin with LDL-C of 85, non-HDL-C of 115 and TG of
200 mg/dL (RC 30 mg/dL) may receive a PCSK9 inhibitor leading to
LDL-C lowering to 50 mg/dL and non-HDL-C to 75 mg/dL, leaving
RC at 25 and TG at 170 mg/dL. While LDL-C and non-HDL-C were
significantly reduced to levels below guideline-recommended targets,
RC is only mildly reduced, and its residual risk could possibly be targeted with TG or RC lowering medications. Whether this approach
to residual risk reduction using new generation therapies will translate into clinical benefit in primary and secondary prevention requires
further evaluation in dedicated randomized trials, especially as recent
data from trials examining TG lowering using n-3 polyunsaturated
fatty acids have shown conflicting results.55,56
In our study, we estimated RC using the definition of non-HDL-C
minus Martin/Hopkins LDL-C given its availability from the standard
lipid panel and its superiority when compared with RC extrapolated
from Friedewald LDL-C.32 Furthermore, different direct measurements and definitions of remnants have been proposed using various
methods such as ultracentrifugation or immunoseparation.32
However, the accuracy of these methods has been questionable
making it difficult to agree on a gold standard and a general preference to use the better standardized TG measurements in clinical trials. Although the definition utilized in our study (regardless of the
LDL-C estimation method used) includes both smaller remnant particles and larger particles such as large VLDL, it has been the most
commonly used in primary and secondary prevention studies showing RC association with risk and is readily available from the standard
lipid profile at no extra cost.24 Reaching consensus on RC measurement or estimation from the standard lipid profile in fasting or nonfasting states is essential to facilitate its adoption in routine practice
and clinical trials.
Finally, we hypothesize, based on all our observations, that estimating and considering RC may potentially yield important residual
risk information beyond LDL-C and non-HDL-C or apoB, particularly in individuals with mild to moderate hypertriglyceridaemia.
Although such risk may be reflected in HDL-C levels, measuring RC
may be more pragmatic in an era when effective RC lowering therapies may become available in our cholesterol treatment armamentarium. However, these therapies still require validation in primary and
secondary prevention outcome trials.
