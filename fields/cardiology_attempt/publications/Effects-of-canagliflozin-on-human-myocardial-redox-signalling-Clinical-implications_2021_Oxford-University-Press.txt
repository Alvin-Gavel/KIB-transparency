Aims

Recent clinical trials indicate that sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors improve cardiovascular outcomes in heart failure patients, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. We explored the direct effects of
canagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor with mild SGLT1 inhibitory effects, on myocardial redox signalling in humans.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
Study 1 included 364 patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Right atrial appendage biopsies were harvested to quanand results
tify superoxide (O:-2 ) sources and the expression of inflammation, fibrosis, and myocardial stretch genes. In Study 2,

atrial tissue from 51 patients was used ex vivo to study the direct effects of canagliflozin on NADPH oxidase activity
and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) uncoupling. Differentiated H9C2 and primary human cardiomyocytes (hCM) were
used to further characterize the underlying mechanisms (Study 3). SGLT1 was abundantly expressed in human atrial
tissue and hCM, contrary to SGLT2. Myocardial SGLT1 expression was positively associated with O:-2 production
and pro-fibrotic, pro-inflammatory, and wall stretch gene expression. Canagliflozin reduced NADPH oxidase activity via AMP kinase (AMPK)/Rac1signalling and improved NOS coupling via increased tetrahydrobiopterin bioavailability ex vivo and in vitro. These were attenuated by knocking down SGLT1 in hCM. Canagliflozin had striking ex vivo
transcriptomic effects on myocardial redox signalling, suppressing apoptotic and inflammatory pathways in hCM.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusions
We demonstrate for the first time that canagliflozin suppresses myocardial NADPH oxidase activity and improves
NOS coupling via SGLT1/AMPK/Rac1 signalling, leading to global anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects in the
human myocardium. These findings reveal a novel mechanism contributing to the beneficial cardiac effects of
canagliflozin.

Translational perspective
Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a novel calls of anti-diabetic drugs that have recently emerged as cardioprotective agents in heart failure, even in the absence of diabetes. Despite their clinical benefit, the underlying effects on the human myocardium remain largely unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate a novel, SGLT1-mediated effect of canagliflozin, a clinically used SGLT2
inhibitor, on myocardial biology affecting its redox state, inflammation, fibrosis, and apoptosis in humans. Our work suggests novel cellular mechanisms underlying the observed clinical benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors; further characterization of the mechanistic effects of the
SGLT2 inhibitor drug class on the human myocardium will broaden their use and indications in cardiovascular disease more efficiently.

Introduction
Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors comprise an
anti-hyperglycaemic drug class regulating plasma glucose by
inhibiting glucose reabsorption through SGLT2 blockade in the
proximal renal tubules.1 Clinically available SGLT2 inhibitors
also display variable affinity to SGLT1.2 While SGLT2 is the main
responsible for glucose reabsorption from the glomerular filtrate,
SGLT1, which is essential for the fast uptake of glucose and galactose in the intestine, plays a minor role in renal reabsorption.
These two sodium-glucose cotransporters have different affinity
and capacity for glucose transport and diverse expression
patterns in the renal proximal tubule as well as in other organs.3
The cardioprotective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors have been
demonstrated in recent clinical trials (EMPA-REG OUTCOME,
CANVAS, DECLARE-TIMI 58) in diabetic4-7 as well as nondiabetic patients with heart failure (DAPA-HF).8,9 Accordingly,
the 2019 ESC guidelines on diabetes, pre-diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases recommend empagliflozin, canagliflozin, or dapagliflozin

in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease, or
at high/very high cardiovascular risk, to reduce cardiovascular events,
as well as in diabetic patients to lower the risk of heart failure hospitalization.10 However, the mechanisms behind these effects remain
unclear.
Limited evidence suggests that SGLT2 inhibitors have direct
cardioprotective effects that extend beyond their systemic
glucose-lowering function. Empagliflozin attenuates cardiac
fibrosis in diabetic mice11 and preserves myocardial function in a
mouse model of pressure overload-induced heart failure.12
Canagliflozin activates AMP kinase (AMPK), whose cardioprotective effects are well established, by inhibiting mitochondrial function and increasing cellular AMP levels in vitro.13 However, several
aspects of the direct effects of SGLT2 inhibition on the human
heart remain unclear.14
Sustained oxidative stress is central to the pathogenesis of cardiac diseases, such as heart failure15 and atrial fibrillation.16,17

Proposed mechanism of canagliflozin-induced improvement of myocardial redox state. Canagliflozin increases intracellular AMP/ATP ratio through
inhibition of SGLT1, which can activate AMPK/NOS signalling and increase NO that suppresses pro-inflammatory signalling. AMPK activation also inhibits
activation of Rac1 and membrane translocation of Rac1 and p47phox, which decrease NADPH oxidase activity and superoxide (O:-2 ) production, attenuates
inflammatory and apoptotic pathways and increasing the bioavailability of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), a key factor for NOS coupling.

isoforms is dependent on activation and membrane translocation
of the GTPase Rac1 and the presence of p47phox.18 On the other
hand, nitric oxide synthases (NOSs) are redox-related enzymes
responsible for nitric oxide (NO) synthesis in the human heart.19
In disease states such as long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation,
myocardial NOS appears to be uncoupled, therefore producing
O:-2 rather than NO as a result of oxidative depletion of its cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4).20 Similar NOS uncoupling is
also observed in various diseases like diabetes and hypertension.21
However, despite the importance of myocardial redox state regulation in cardiac biology, the putative antioxidant effects on the
human heart of different SGLT2 inhibitors have not been well
investigated so far.14
In this study, we first explored the expression profiles of
SGLT2 and SGLT1 in the human heart to determine the molecular target of direct SGLT1/2 inhibition in the human atrial myocardium. Secondly, we evaluated the direct effects of the
SGLT2-specific inhibitor empagliflozin and the dual SGLT1/2 inhibitor canagliflozin on myocardial redox signalling in the human
heart.

Cell culture models
The effects of SGLT1/2 on cardiomyocytes were first screened in the rat
cardiac myocyte-derived cell line, H9c2, and the key findings were replicated in human cardiomyocytes (hCM, PromoCell, Heidelberg,
Germany). H9c2 cells were differentiated to cardiac myocytes in
Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (glucose 5.5 mM, Sigma-Aldrich, cat.
number D6046) supplemented with 1% horse serum (Sigma-Aldrich).
Primary hCM isolated from adult heart ventricles were purchased and differentiated to cardiac myocytes in dedicated Myocyte Growth Medium
(glucose 5.5 mM) with SupplementMix (PromoCell) for 60 days after
reaching 100% confluence. Troponin I expression and myotube formation were used to confirm efficient cardiomyocyte differentiation
(Supplementary material online, Figure S1).
Both hCM and H9c2 cells were cultured in a high-glucose medium
(25 mM) for 72 h before in vitro incubations to mimic the human ex vivo
experimental environment and the in vivo diabetes environment, as
25 mM is the most prevalent concentration of glucose used in the literature to mimic diabetic hyperglycaemia in H9c2 cells.26 In selected experiments, glucose was replaced by mannitol 25 mM to study the role of the
canagliflozin-induced glucose transfer. Cells were treated with canagliflozin 10 lmol/L (Cayman) +/- Compound C (CC, an AMPK inhibitor,
10 lmol/L) or carrier (DMSO) for 60 min or 24 h and used for chemiluminescence experiments, gene expression studies and downstream signalling experiments. The specificity of CC as an AMPK inhibitor was
confirmed by tracking downstream phosphorylation of its validated surrogate target, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC).

Human tissue harvesting
Human myocardial biopsies were processed as described (see
Supplementary material online, Data supplement) .22

Superoxide quantification
O:-2 production was measured in human atrial myocardium homogenates
and cell lysates using lucigenin (5 lmol/L)-enhanced chemiluminescence
evaluating NADPH oxidase activity and NOS coupling status as described
(see Supplementary material online, Data supplement).17,22,27

RNA isolation and quantitative real
time-polymerase chain reaction
RNA was purified in a semi-automated way and processed for cDNA
generation and gene expression studies as described (see Supplementary
material online, Data supplement).28

the human myocardium (Study 1). SGLT2 was undetectable in 96%
of tested human myocardial samples whilst SGLT1 was abundantly
expressed (Figure 1A and Supplementary material online, Figure S2).

For Study 1, continuous variables were tested for normal distribution
using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Non-normally distributed variables
are presented as median [25th-75th percentile], whereas normally distributed variables are presented as mean +/- SD. The correlation of two
continuous variables was evaluated with Pearson's r or Spearman's rank
correlation coefficients, as appropriate. Continuous variable comparisons
were performed using Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney U-test (for two
groups, as appropriate) or by ANOVA (for >2 groups), followed by
Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Power calculations
were based on myocardial NADPH oxidase activity and we estimated
that with 363 patients we could detect a difference of 0.25 in
log(NADPH-stimulated O:-2 ) between high vs. low myocardial SGLT1 expression with power 0.9 [assuming a standard deviation of 1.04 in
log(NADPH-stimulated O:-2 )].
To test whether the association of myocardial NADPH-stimulated O:-2
with myocardial SGLT1 expression was independent of other risk factors,
we performed multivariable linear regression analysis where myocardial
NADPH-stimulated O:-2 was used as a dependent variable and myocardial
SGLT1 expression, age, sex, diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, and NYHA class were used as independent variables. The standardized betas (Bstand) are presented for each covariate.
In order to assess the independent effect of myocardial SGLT1 expression on NADPH-stimulated and Vas2870-inhibitable O:-2 as well as myocardial TNFa, IL6, ANP, BNP, and COL1A1 expression, each of the
aforementioned variables was used as a dependent variable in individual
multivariable linear regression analyses, and myocardial SGLT1 expression
was used as an independent variable. Age, sex, diabetes, hypertension,
smoking (categorized as previous/active smoker vs. never-smoked) and
NYHA class (class IV vs. lower classes) were used as covariates.
For Study 2, we estimated that with a minimum of five pairs of samples
we would be able to identify a change of log(NADPH-stimulated O:-2 ) by
0.37 with a = 0.05, power 0.9 and SD for paired response difference of
0.30 upon canagliflozin treatments. Paired comparisons between two
groups were performed using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. When the
changes between two paired analyses were compared that was performed using two-way ANOVA with interaction terms as stated in the
respective figure legends. All tests were two-sided and alpha (a) was set
at 0.05. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 20.0 and R
version 3.6.0.

Figure 1 Sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT)1/2 expression in human atrial myocardium and relations with myocardial redox state and inflammation biomarkers. (A) SGLT1 was abundantly expressed in the human atrial myocardium, contrary to SGLT2. n = 357 [290 non-diabetic patients (no
DM); 67 diabetic patients (DM)]. SGLT1 expression was positively correlated with NADPH-stimulated (B) and Vas2870-inhibitable (C) O:-2 as well as
tumour necrosis factor-a (TNFa, D), interleukin-6 (IL6, E), atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP, F), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP, G), and collagen 1A1
(Col1A1, H) expression. P-values by Mann-Whitney U-test for no DM vs. DM (A) and highest quartile of SGLT1 expression vs. rest (B-H). Data are
presented as mean +/- SD (A) and median [25th-75th percentile] (B-H).

empagliflozin, which has little affinity to SGLT1,31 did not affect myocardial O:-2 generation, NADPH oxidase activity, or NOS coupling
(Figure 2H-K). This finding could be explained by the very low affinity
of empagliflozin to SGLT1, which is the main SGLT isoform in the
human atrial and ventricular myocardium, and implies that clinically
used SGLT2 inhibitors may exert direct myocardial effects depending
on the degree of SGLT1 affinity. Therefore, we focused our next
experiments on evaluating the direct effects of canagliflozin on myocardial redox signalling in humans, due to its dual SGLT1/SGLT2
affinity.
We first investigated the mechanism by which canagliflozin affects
NADPH oxidase activity and NOS coupling status. To understand
how canagliflozin reduced NADPH oxidase activity, we explored
which subunits of the enzyme are mostly affected. Canagliflozin prevented the GTP activation of Rac1 (an important Nox1/2 subunit,
Figure 3A) and its membrane translocation (Figure 3B), which lead to
Nox1/2 isoform activation, while preventing the membrane translocation of the p47phox subunit of Nox2 (Figure 3C). To assess
whether NADPH oxidase activity increased O:-2 generation, not only
directly, but also indirectly, we evaluated the oxidation of the NOS
co-factor BH4. Canagliflozin increased BH4 levels in the atrial myocardium without affecting total biopterin content (Figure 3D-F), suggesting that it decreased BH4 oxidation (e.g. as a result of NADPH
oxidase inhibition) rather than increased the biopterin biosynthetic
pathway. Indeed, we also observed a reduction in BH2, the direct oxidation product of BH4, while biopterin, the terminal oxidation product of BH2 oxidation, was borderline decreased (Supplementary
material online, Figure S4A-F). This would lead to improved enzymatic
coupling of NOS and to a reduction in NOS-derived O:-2 .
We next explored the upstream mechanism of the effects of canagliflozin on the myocardial redox state. Canagliflozin induced rapid
phosphorylation of AMPKa2 (the main isoform in the heart) at the
activation site Thr172 (Figure 3G), resulting in increased AMPKa2 activity documented by phosphorylation of its downstream target ACC
at Ser79 (Figure 3H). Canagliflozin did not affect ERK phosphorylation
at Thr202/Tyr204 or AKT at Ser473 (Figure 3I and J). Interestingly,
canagliflozin also induced endothelial NOS phosphorylation at the activation site Ser1177 (Figure 3K), whereas it did not affect inducible

NOS phosphorylation (Supplementary material online, Figure S4G
and H). We next used CC, as an allosteric modulator of AMPK activity,32 to prove the concept that downstream SGLT1 effects are prevented by inhibiting AMPK activity. Compound C inhibited ACC
phosphorylation (Figure 3G and H) as well as the ability of canagliflozin
to inhibit Rac1 activation or increase BH4 bioavailability (Figure 3A-E).
Compound C prevented the canagliflozin-induced reduction of
myocardial O:-2 generation (Figure 3L-N) and of the increase in NOS
coupling (Figure 3O), identifying AMPKa2 as a link between canagliflozin, NADPH oxidase activity, and NOS coupling. Canagliflozin
could also reduce apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction through
AMPKa2 (Supplementary material online, Figure S5).

Direct effects of canagliflozin on primary
human cardiomyocytes
We next studied the effects of canagliflozin specifically on primary
terminally differentiated hCM (Supplementary material online, Figure
S1). To mimic the ex vivo human atrial myocardium experimental conditions as well as a clinically relevant diabetic environment, hCM
were cultured in high-glucose medium. Osmolality changes associated with high glucose had no effect on myocardial redox state using
mannitol as osmolality control (Supplementary material online, Figure
S6). As observed in the human atrial myocardium, canagliflozin
increased AMPKa2 Thr172 phosphorylation (Figure 4A) leading to
AMPKa2 activation, as assessed by the phosphorylation status of
ACC at Ser79 (Figure 4B). In addition, canagliflozin increased BH4 bioavailability, without altering total biopterins in hCM, in a CCreversible way (Figure 4A-E). Similarly to the human atrial myocardium, exogenous canagliflozin reduced basal O:-2 generation (Figure
4F) and NADPH oxidase activity (Figure 4G and H) and improved
NOS coupling (Figure 4I) in an AMPKa2-dependent manner (since all
those effects were reversed by CC) in hCM. Dihydroethidium staining confirmed the effect of canagliflozin on NADPH oxidase-derived
O2.- in hCM (Figure 4J-L). Canagliflozin also induced NOS phosphorylation at its activation site Ser1177 in hCM (Supplementary material
online, Figure S7). These findings were replicated in H9c2 cells
(Supplementary material online, Figures S8 and S9), where the results
were more striking after culture in a high-glucose medium.

The role of SGLT1 in myocardial redox
regulation by canagliflozin
To explore how canagliflozin affects the upstream phosphorylation
of AMPKa2, we next evaluated the intracellular ADP-to-ATP ratio in
hCM, which can allosterically regulate AMPKa2 activity and autophosphorylation. Canagliflozin increased ADP/ATP in a dosedependent manner (Figure 5A). Depleting glucose from the culture
media resulted in increased ADP/ATP (Figure 5A) and activated
AMPKa2, evidenced by ACC phosphorylation. Adding canagliflozin
to glucose-starved hCM did not lead to further change on either
AMPKa2 or ACC (Figure 5B and C). These indicate that the effect of
canagliflozin on hCM is dependent on glucose uptake, which then
affects intracellular ADP/ATP and subsequent AMPKa2 activation.
Consistent with our findings in human cardiac samples, hCM
SGLT2 expression was undetectable (Figure 5D-F). SGLT1 expression
was confirmed by qPCR and Western immunoblotting using HEK293
cells as positive control (Figure 5D and E). To further explore the

Figure 2 Direct effects of canagliflozin and empagliflozin on human myocardial redox state. Ex vivo canagliflozin (3, 10, and 100 lM) treatment for
1 h reduced basal (A), NADPH-stimulated (B), and Vas2870 inhibitable O:-2 (C) and increased L-NAME-(delta O:-2 ) (D) dose-dependently in human
atrial myocardium. Canagliflozin decreased the intensity of basal and Vas2870 inhibitable 2-hydroxyethidium (2-OH-ethidium) fluorescence (E-G) in
human atrial biopsies stained with dihydroethidium (DHE). Empagliflozin had non-significant direct effect on either of these measures (H-K). n = 5-7
in panels A-L. Data are presented as mean +/- SD. P-values are calculated by Wilcoxon signed-rank test (A-C, F-J) and paired t-test (D, K).

Figure 3 Effects of canagliflozin on myocardial NADPH oxidase activity and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) coupling status in the human atrial myocardium. Canagliflozin (10 lM for 1 h) inhibited GTP activation (A) and membrane translocation (B) of Rac1, as well as the membrane translocation
of p47phox (C). Canagliflozin increased myocardial BH4 but not total biopterin content (D-F). Canagliflozin induced AMPK Thr172 phosphorylation
(G) and downstream acetyl-coA carboxylase (ACC) Ser79 phosphorylation (H). These were prevented by the AMPK inhibitor, compound C (CC)
(G and H). Canagliflozin did not affect ERK or AKT phosphorylation (I and J). Canagliflozin induced NOS Ser1177 phosphorylation (K). Compound C
prevented the effects of canagliflozin on Rac1 activation, BH4 bioavailability (A-F), O:-2 generation (L-N), and NOS coupling (O). n = 5-8 pairs in panels
A-O. Data are presented as mean +/- SD. P-values are calculated by Wilcoxon signed-rank test (A-N) and paired t-test (O).

Figure 4 Direct effects of canagliflozin on human cardiomyocytes (hCM). Canagliflozin (10 lM) induced phosphorylation of AMPK and acetyl-coA
carboxylase (ACC) in high glucose (HG)-treated human cardiomyocytes (A and B, n = 8) and increased BH4 levels without affecting total biopterin
levels (C-E, n = 8). Canagliflozin decreased basal, NADPH-stimulated and Vas2870-inhibitable O:-2 and increased the value of L-NAME delta(O:-2 ) in
human cardiomyocytes (F-I, n = 7). Dihydroethidium (DHE) staining combined with Vas2870 confirmed these (J-L, n = 8). Data are presented as
mean +/- SD. P-values are calculated by Wilcoxon signed-rank test (A-H, J, K) and paired t-test (I).

Figure 5 SGLT1 mediates the effects of canagliflozin on myocardial redox state. Canagliflozin increased ADP/ATP dose-dependently in human cardiomyocytes, while glucose deprivation from the culture medium (NG) induced similar changes in ADP/ATP ratio (A, n = 8). There were no differences in AMPK and ACC phosphorylation among the NG-incubated cells with or without canagliflozin (10lM), and high glucose (HG)-incubated cells
with canagliflozin (panels B and C, n = 8). SGLT1 expression was detected, while SGLT2 was not detected in human cardiomyocytes (D-F, n = 8).
SGLT1 was knocked down using siRNA (transfection low toxicity and efficiency was confirmed by transfecting BlockiT Alexa Fluor Red Fluorescent
control, G), resulting into 76% down-regulation of SGLT1 mRNA (panel H, n = 6), and 85% protein down-regulation (panel I, n = 6). Canagliflozininduced AMPK and ACC phosphorylation was attenuated in SGLT1 knocked down human cardiomyocytes compared with siRNA ctrl human cardiomyocytes (J and K, n = 8). SGLT1 deletion diminished canagliflozin-induced decrease of basal (L), NADPH-stimulated (M), and Vas2870-inhibitable
O:-2 production (N) and increased L-NAME delta O:-2 (O). n = 8 in L-O. Data are presented as mean +/- SD. P-values are calculated by Wilcoxon
signed-rank test (A-C, H, I). Comparisons in canagliflozin responses between siControl and siSGLT1 cells were performed with two-way ANOVA
with treatment (canagliflozin)  cell type (siControl or siSGLT1) interaction (J-O).

Direct effects of canagliflozin on redoxsensitive pro-inflammatory signalling in
the human myocardium
After establishing a role for canagliflozin as a regulator of the myocardial redox state, we explored its downstream effects on the transcriptomic profile of hCM. Canagliflozin (10 lM) treatment for 24 h
altered the expression of 946 differentially expressed genes (DEGs,
466 up-regulated and 480 down-regulated) in hCM, with 127 DEGs
demonstrating an effect size of >50% or-50% (Figure 6A). Pathway
analysis revealed that canagliflozin down-regulated a number of proinflammatory pathways such as those of IL1, IL3, TNFa, chemokines,
MAPK signalling, and others, as well as apoptotic signalling pathways
(Figure 6B). Notably, the nuclear factor kappa beta (NFkB) signalling
pathway, a major redox-sensitive inflammatory transcriptional regulator, was one of the most down-regulated targets by canagliflozin, suggesting that it may contribute to the antioxidant effect of canagliflozin
in hCM. Cell survival pathways such as PI3K-Akt, NOTCH3, and Ras signalling were also up-regulated by canagliflozin. Key genes of the NFkB,
TNF-a, and apoptotic pathways mostly affected by canagliflozin
included TNFRSF11, TRAF5, FZD7, CASP7, and BAD. The expression of
these genes, quantified in atrial biopsies of 364 patients from Study 1,
was positively associated with myocardial NADPH oxidase activity
(Figure 6C).

Discussion
In this work, we identify SGLT1 as the main SGLT isoform in the
human myocardium, its expression being positively related with myocardial oxidative stress. As the main objective of this study was to
evaluate the direct effects of SGLT1 vs. SGLT2 inhibition on the myocardium and SGLT2 is not expressed in human myocardium and cardiac myocytes, we focused on canagliflozin, which has significant
affinity for SGLT1. We further demonstrate that a clinically relevant
concentration of canagliflozin directly suppresses NADPH oxidase
activity, increases BH4 bioavailability, and improves NOS coupling in
isolated hCM and myocardial tissue via an SGLT1/AMPK/Rac1dependent mechanism. These suppress redox-sensitive pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic signalling in the human cardiomyocyte,

providing a novel mechanism contributing to the beneficial effects of
canagliflozin on cardiac adverse events (Graphical abstract).
The role of SGLT isoforms in myocardial physiology is controversial.33,34 SGLT2 expression has been detected in hCM after exposure
to high glucose; however, other studies have shown no SGLT2 expression in human hearts. In contrast, SGLT1 was found in hCM 34,35
while functionally damaging variants in SGLT1 have been associated
with reduced death/heart failure risk.36 We definitively demonstrate,
using a large number of human myocardial biopsies and hCM, that
SGLT1 is abundantly expressed in the human heart, whereas SGLT2
is barely detectable.
Clinically used SGLT2 inhibitors have variable SGLT1 affinities.
Canagliflozin displays higher SGLT1 affinity than other SGLT2 inhibitors,30,31,37 whilst empagliflozin is the most selective SGLT2 inhibitor.31 Evidence has suggested differing cellular responses to
canagliflozin vs. empagliflozin, e.g. canagliflozin is a stronger inducer of
AMPK phosphorylation in HEK293 cells or human vascular endothelial cells.13,38 Importantly, we demonstrate for the first time that canagliflozin (in concentrations comparable to in vivo pharmacological
levels39,40) directly inhibits NADPH oxidase-derived oxidative stress
in human myocardial redox signalling via SGLT1/AMPK/Rac1 signalling, which may be more potent than empagliflozin. Furthermore,
canagliflozin could reverse the decrease in ADP/ATP ratio due to a
hyperglycaemic environment by inhibiting glucose uptake in hCM.
Myocardial oxidative stress facilitates apoptosis and inflammation,
leading to cardiac fibrosis and promoting cardiac dysfunction.41
Myocardial inflammation is influenced by redox-sensitive transcriptional factors such as NFkB.42 Our transcriptome analysis demonstrated that canagliflozin suppresses several redox-sensitive proinflammatory and pro-apoptotic pathways in hCM, such as those of
TNF-a and IL-1 as well as, crucially, on NFkB activity. The link of canagliflozin with myocardial redox regulation was further validated in
400 human atrial biopsies, by demonstrating a clear relationship between myocardial NADPH oxidase-derived O:-2 and the expression
of key genes regulated by canagliflozin.
Certain aspects of the interplay between SGLT2 inhibitors and
myocardial disease are not explored in our work. SGLT2 inhibitors
with little SGLT1 selectivity (e.g. empagliflozin) also demonstrate cardioprotective effects despite lacking SGLT1 affinity. A very recent
study from Kolijn et al.14 described an antioxidant effect of empagliflozin, in humans with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction as
well as in ZDF obese rats, evaluated by lipid peroxidation levels,
which was accompanied by improved NO-sGC-PKG signalling.
Although in our study empagliflozin did not affect NADPH oxidasederived superoxide production in human atrial myocardium, these
two pieces of work may describe distinct mechanisms, which could
be complementary and the discrepancies in results may be due to different participant characteristics, use of different (indirect) readings
of redox state (we specifically targeted NADPH oxidase-derived
superoxide, whilst Kolijn et al.14 targeted lipid peroxidation, which is
influenced by reactive oxygen species levels, antioxidant capacity, and
cell metabolism) and tissue type differences (atrial vs. ventricular tissue). Furthermore, this suggests that systemic SGLT2 inhibition has
also indirect effects on the human heart, most likely by affecting kidney function as well as the secretome of other tissues with indirect,
endocrine effects on cardiac function, which is not explored here.
However, some SGLT2 inhibitors (like canagliflozin) may well have

dependency of the effects of canagliflozin on SGLT1, we knocked
down the expression of SGLT1 in hCM using siRNA (Figure 5G),
achieving down-regulation of SGLT1 mRNA by 76% and protein by
85% (Figure 5H and I). This prevented canagliflozin-induced AMPK
activation and downstream ACC phosphorylation in hCM (Figure 5J
and K). SGLT1 knock down prevented the ability of canagliflozin to reduce basal, NADPH-stimulated and Vas2870-inhibitable O:-2 (Figure
5L-N), supporting that canagliflozin suppresses myocardial NADPH
oxidase activity by inhibiting SGLT1. SGLT1 knock down in hCM also
prevented the ability of canagliflozin to improve NOS coupling
(Figure 5O). SGLT1 knock down did not lead to a compensatory increase in SGLT2 expression (Supplementary material online, Figure
S10). Interestingly, knock down of SGLT1 did not fully mimic the
effects observed with canagliflozin, and this could be explained either
by the incomplete SGLT1 knock down technically achieved in these
cells, or even by the presence of off-target effects of canagliflozin, independent of SGLT1/2 inhibition.

Figure 6 Canagliflozin has a global anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effect on human cardiomyocytes. In this experiment, human cardiomyocytes were cultured in high-glucose medium (25 mM) for 72 h and then treated with canagliflozin (10 lM) or DMSO for 24 h. Heat map of 127
down- or up-regulated genes by canagliflozin (fold change >1.5 or-1.5, P < 0.05) in canagliflozin-treated human cardiomyocytes from n = 7 patients

(more than 50% of pathway genes down-regulated by canagliflozin, B). TNFRSF11, TRAF5, FZD7, CASP7, and BAD were the most down-regulated individual genes upon canagliflozin treatment, implicated in NFkB, TNFa, and apoptosis pathways. The mRNA expression of these genes was positively
correlated with myocardial NADPH oxidase activity (i.e. high Vas2870-inhibitable signal) in 240 atrial biopsies from Study 1 (C). Data are presented

chronic direct effects on the heart via cardiac SGLT1 inhibition, and
this direct effect on the human myocardium was the objective of our
study. This concept warrants further validation in appropriate in vivo
animal models, such as Sglt1 loss- and gain-of-function mouse models.
Of note is the fact that the ex vivo experiments were performed on
myocardial tissue of atrial origin, whereas our mechanistic experiments were carried out in cardiomyocytes derived from ventricles.
The fact that our proposed mechanism is shown in a similar way in all
models (human atrial myocardium, human ventricular cardiomyocytes, and terminally differentiated H9c2 cells) further strengthens
the validity of the proposed mechanisms by which canagliflozin affects
myocardial biology. In this study, we evaluate the membrane translocation of NADPH oxidase subunits by measuring their levels on
isolated membranes vs. the cytosolic phase using an ultracentrifugation protocol, rather than electron microscopy, and this is
a methodological limitation that needs to be acknowledged. Finally, in
translational studies like this one, surgical human tissue availability
varies, and this has led to variability in sample sizes across the various
experiments in this study.
In conclusion, we demonstrate for the first time that canagliflozin
inhibits NADPH oxidase activity and improves NOS coupling via
SGLT1/AMPKa2/Rac1 signalling, whilst suppressing several proinflammatory and pro-apoptotic pathways in the human myocardium.
Our work describes an important SGLT1-mediated mechanism
that could contribute to the cardioprotective effects of the SGLT2
drug class.
