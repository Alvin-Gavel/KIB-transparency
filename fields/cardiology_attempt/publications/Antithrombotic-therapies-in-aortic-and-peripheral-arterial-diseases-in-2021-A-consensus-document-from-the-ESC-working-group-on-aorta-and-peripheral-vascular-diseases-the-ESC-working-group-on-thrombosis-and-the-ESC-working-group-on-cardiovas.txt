The aim of this collaborative document is to provide an update for clinicians on best antithrombotic strategies in patients with aortic and/
or peripheral arterial diseases. Antithrombotic therapy is a pillar of optimal medical treatment for these patients at very high cardiovascular risk. While the number of trials on antithrombotic therapies in patients with aortic or peripheral arterial diseases is substantially smaller
than for those with coronary artery disease, recent evidence deserves to be incorporated into clinical practice. In the absence of specific
indications for chronic oral anticoagulation due to concomitant cardiovascular disease, a single antiplatelet agent is the basis for long-term
antithrombotic treatment in patients with aortic or peripheral arterial diseases. Its association with another antiplatelet agent or low-dose
anticoagulants will be discussed, based on patient's ischaemic and bleeding risk as well therapeutic paths (e.g. endovascular therapy).
This consensus document aims to provide a guidance for antithrombotic therapy according to arterial disease localizations and clinical
presentation. However, it cannot substitute multidisciplinary team discussions, which are particularly important in patients with uncertain
ischaemic/bleeding balance. Importantly, since this balance evolves over time in an individual patient, a regular reassessment of the antithrombotic therapy is of paramount importance.

Introduction
In 2017, the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), in collaboration
with the European Society for Vascular Surgery, released guidelines
on the diagnosis and management of peripheral arterial diseases
(PADs).1 They highlighted the importance of antithrombotic therapy
to prevent major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and emphasized major gaps in evidence with respect to risk reduction associated
with newer antithrombotic treatments. Since then, results from
major randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as well as registries have
dramatically modified the landscape of antithrombotic options in
these patients. In addition, peripheral events, frequently grouped as
major adverse limb events (MALE), have gained increasing attention.
Therefore, the three working groups involved in the present collaborative document sensed the urgency to give clinicians a holistic
roadmap to optimize antithrombotic management in patients with
aortic disease and/or PADs, with a focus on the post-procedural and
chronic phases of these diseases. The document is presented by

arterial territory and ends with the management of patients requiring
chronic oral anticoagulants for associated conditions and the assessment of bleeding risk in vascular patients.

Key messages: Antithrombotic therapies for carotid, subclavian, or vertebral artery disease
o Long-term antiplatelet therapy with aspirin or clopidogrel is proposed

If clopidogrel is added, it should be limited to 1 month to limit bleeding complications.100 cThere are no data for a head-tohead comparison between R th A vs. A th C strategies. The latter has been empirically implemented and recommended for endovascular therapy,1 while
the R th A has been recently assessed in a randomized trial.80 Also, the R th A strategy can be prolonged beyond the post-revascularization period with
benefits on MACE and MALE.

Antithrombotic treatment
therapy in carotid artery
disease
Carotid plaques are potential sources of embolic stroke and are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events beyond stroke.
Since no trial has investigated single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT, e.g.
aspirin) to reduce cardiovascular events in patients with non-stenotic
carotid plaques, this document will focus on patients with carotid artery stenosis (luminal narrowing >50%).

Asymptomatic carotid artery disease
Antithrombotic treatment in patients with asymptomatic carotid
stenosis remains controversial. The ACB study, the only trial in this
setting, failed to show the superiority of aspirin vs. placebo but was
limited in size (Table 1).3 In observational studies, SAPT, consisting
mainly of low-dose aspirin, was associated with reduced risk of
MACE, although data were conflicting for moderate stenosis (i.e.
50%-75%).12-14 DAPT, combining aspirin and clopidogrel, was of no
benefit over SAPT.15 The ESC guidelines suggest long-term SAPT in
patients with asymptomatic >_50% carotid artery stenosis, if bleeding
risk is low.1
More recently, the COMPASS trial randomized patients with
chronic coronary and/or peripheral artery disease into three arms:
dual pathway inhibition (DPI) combining aspirin 100 mg o.d. th rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid vs. rivaroxaban 5 mg bid vs. aspirin 100 mg o.d.16
Overall, a significant decrease in MACE was reported in patients allocated to DPI vs. aspirin alone (Table 1), with a similar trend, albeit not
statically significant likely due to the limited sample size, observed
among the 1919 patients with either history of carotid revascularization or asymptomatic >_50% stenosis.16 Specific data on the subgroup
with asymptomatic carotid stenosis were not reported.

..
.. Symptomatic carotid artery disease
.. Symptomatic carotid stenosis is associated with a high risk of
..
.. early recurrence of cerebrovascular ischaemic events.17 In patients
..
.. with cerebrovascular accidents related to large arterial disease,
.. SAPT (aspirin or clopidogrel) was more effective in reducing re..
.. current events than oral anticoagulation with vitamin K antago.. nists (VKA).2,3,18,19 A subgroup analysis of the SOCRATES trial
..
.. with ipsilateral atherosclerotic stenosis demonstrated significantly
.. lower rates of MACE in patients receiving ticagrelor vs. aspirin
..
.. (Table 1).4
..
Regarding DAPT in the early phase of symptomatic carotid sten..
.. osis, the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel reduces the risk of
.. asymptomatic cerebral embolization and stroke.20-23 It also reduces
..
.. the risk of stroke recurrence after minor stroke ischaemic attack and
..
.. TIA.24,25 More recently, the THALES trial (n = 11 016) showed a sig.. nificant 17% risk of death or stroke reduction when using ticagrelor
..
.. th aspirin vs. aspirin alone in patients with minor stroke or high-risk
.. TIA.26 In a pre-specified subgroup analysis of patients with ipsilateral
..
.. extra/intracranial stenosis >30%, the risk reduction was even more
.. substantial (Table 1), with a very high benefit/risk ratio.5 Data on the

..
.. (CAS), for a total of 150 patients, and both trials were prematurely
.. interrupted due to unacceptable neurologic event rate in the SAPT
..
.. arm (3 vs. 0 strokes and 11 vs. 1 TIA).30 Given the experience with
.. coronary stenting, most operators favour empirically DAPT after
..
.. CAS for at least 1 month. In a Taiwanese nationwide registry,31 the
.. 6-month rates of ischaemic stroke, composite vascular events, or
..
.. death were similar among 2829 patients with DAPT durations of
..
.. <30, 30-41 and >_42 days. In a single-centre series of patients under.. going CAS, the addition of cilostazol has been proposed on the top
..
.. of DAPT, in case of platelet resistance to clopidogrel to reduce

of carotid revascularization, who are considered at very-high risk
because of associated comorbidities (especially polyvascular patients),
provided bleeding risk is not high.*
In the absence of specific evidence, it is reasonable to apply the
same antithrombotic strategies proposed for carotid artery disease
to vertebral and subclavian artery diseases.

Antithrombotic therapies in aortic and peripheral arterial diseases

Antithrombotic treatment in
patients with vertebral and
subclavian artery stenosis
The evidence on the use of antithrombotic agents in case of vertebral
or subclavian artery stenosis is lacking, but their use is reasonable
given the overall cardiovascular risk in these patients (see
Supplementary material online).44,45

Aortic diseases
Key messages: Antithrombotic therapies in aortic diseases
o Long-term SAPT should be proposed in patients with severe/
complex aortic plaques.*

o Following an embolic event possibly related to a complex aortic
plaque, DAPT may be proposed.

o SAPT may be proposed in patients with an aortic aneurysm (AA) to
o

o

reduce general cardiovascular risk, without convincing proof of
reducing aneurysmal growth.
There is no validated long-term antithrombotic therapy in patients
following acute aortic syndromes. Beyond the acute phase,
antithrombotic therapy should be maintained if clearly indicated
(e.g. anticoagulation for mechanical valve or atrial fibrillation).
However, close monitoring with imaging techniques is mandatory.
Long-term SAPT can be proposed after (T)EVAR, based on patient's
risk characteristics.

*See Supplementary material online, table S1.

..
.. Aortic plaques
..
..
.. Aortic plaques are observed in 40%-50% of middle-aged individu.. als.46 The disease severity is quantified based on plaque thickness and
..
.. the presence of ulceration/mobile components (Supplementary ma.. terial online, Table S1).47 The size and complexity of aortic arch pla..
.. ques are associated with cerebrovascular events (OR: 4-9 in plaques
.. >_4 mm or complex),48 but can also cause peripheral events. Despite
..
.. antithrombotic therapies, the annual incidence of stroke recurrence
.. is up to 12%.49
..
..
.. Primary prevention
..
.. Given the high prevalence of aortic plaques among adults, the lack of
..
.. evidence for aspirin use in asymptomatic patients with aortic plaques,
.. and doubts on benefit/risk ratio of aspirin in primary prevention, it is
..
.. not reasonable to prescribe aspirin for simple aortic plaques. SAPT,
.. preferably clopidogrel18,50 or low-dose aspirin,51 can be suggested in
..
.. severe/complex plaques. Anticoagulation51 or DAPT50 is not indi.. cated as they are of no benefit while they increase the bleeding risk.
..
..
.. Secondary prevention
..
.. After an embolic TIA/stroke or peripheral event related to aortic pla.. que, SAPT with aspirin or clopidogrel is recommended. DAPT or
..
.. VKA (INR 2-3) can be discussed, but the level of evidence is low or
.. inconclusive.51,52 Further studies are needed to determine optimal
..
.. duration of antithrombotic treatment, as the benefit appears more
..
.. pronounced within the first weeks after stroke while long-term
.. bleeding risk remains elevated. The choice of antithrombotic therapy
..
.. should follow the current guidelines irrespective of the presence of
.. aortic plaques.53 In cryptogenic stroke, rivaroxaban 15 mg o.d.54 or
..
.. dabigatran 110-150 mg bid55 were not found to be superior to low.. dose aspirin. Specific data on stroke secondary to aortic plaques are
..
.. missing.
..
..
..
.. Aortic aneurysms
..
..
.. Patients with AAs, either thoracic or abdominal (AAA), are at
.. increased risk of MACE.56-58 Thus, despite the absence of dedicated
..
.. studies, SAPT (aspirin or clopidogrel) may be reasonable for patients
.. without contraindication.59 Anticoagulants are not indicated as they
..
.. are associated with a higher bleeding risk.60 In case of intraluminal
..
.. thrombus or occlusive aneurysm, anticoagulation can be considered,
.. in light of the role of the mural thrombus in aneurysmal progres..
.. sion.61 In an RCT in 144 aspirin-naive patients with small AAA, no dif.. ference in aneurysmal growth at 1 year was found between ticagrelor

between DAPT and SAPT, but a significantly higher risk of major
bleeding and neck haematoma with DAPT.30 A pooled analysis of
two recent large RCTs comparing DAPT vs. aspirin alone in patients
with stroke or TIA24,25 demonstrated a significant reduction in
MACE within the first 21 days [5.2% vs. 7.8%; hazard ratio (HR) 0.66;
95% confidence interval (CI) 0.56-0.77], without a significant increase
in major bleeding events.36 No specific results in stroke secondary to
carotid disease were reported.
In asymptomatic patients undergoing CEA, a retrospective study
including 28 683 procedures showed that DAPT was associated with a
39% risk reduction in neurological events vs. aspirin alone [odds ratio
(OR) 0.61; 95% CI 0.43-0.87], at the cost of higher rate of bleeding
requiring reoperation (OR 1.71; 95% CI 1.20-2.42).37 The single small
RCT of DAPT vs. SAPT in asymptomatic patients was underpowered
for clinical endpoints; it demonstrated that a single 75 mg dose of clopidogrel (on top of aspirin) the night before surgery reduced significantly
embolization rates within the first 3 post-operative hours.38 In a recent
meta-analysis including that RCT38 and six retrospective observational
studies37,39-43 comparing DAPT (n = 8536) to SAPT (n = 27 320) during CEA, the former did not reduce 30-day mortality, stroke, or TIA
but increased major bleeding events (1.27% vs. 0.83%; P = 0.0003) and
neck haematomas (8.19% vs. 6.77%; P = 0.001).30

growth, rupture, or death).63 No longitudinal study has assessed the
role of antithrombotic therapy after intramural haematoma, while
case series suggest that anticoagulation does not impact intramural
haematoma progression. Close monitoring with imaging techniques
should be performed in all patients following acute aortic syndromes.
If the evolution is unsatisfactory, endovascular or surgical treatment
should be considered.64,65

There are limited data on the antithrombotic treatment after (thoracic) endovascular aortic replacement [(T)EVARth]. However, SAPT
(e.g. aspirin) is advised to avoid cardiovascular events over time.66
Only in one study with 28 patients, De Bruin et al.67 administered
DAPT prior to EVAR, without describing the combination duration.
In patients undergoing both (T)EVAR and percutaneous coronary
intervention, DAPT has not been associated with increased rate of
bleeding, endoleak or recurrent dissection.68,69 Anticoagulation has
been associated with a higher rate of complications including endoleak, re-intervention, late conversion surgery, or mortality.70
Endograft thrombus lining is present in >20% of cases after
(T)EVAR, two-third of which remain stable or disappear.71 It results
from the complex interaction of systemic haemorheological factors
(coagulation disorders or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia),
hemodynamics at the level of the prosthesis or device-related characteristics (polyester-covered stent-grafts or aorto-uni-iliac endograft).72 It has not been associated with thromboembolic comp
lications, thus, conservative treatment using SAPT remains consensual. Lifelong oral anticoagulation is reserved for patients at low
bleeding risk with thromboembolic events or growing thrombus. In
patients at high bleeding risk, anticoagulation interruption and relining
with a new endograft is advised.73

Lower-extremity artery disease
Figure 1 and Table 2 summarize trials on antithrombotic therapies in
patients with LEAD.16,18,74-86

Key messages: Antithrombotic therapy
in patients with LEAD
There is no proven benefit to support the use of aspirin in patients
with asymptomatic lower extremity artery disease (LEAD) and no significant coronary artery disease or PAD in other territories.
Asymptomatic LEAD in patients with other clinical atherosclerotic disease (e.g. CAD) confers an increased risk of cardiovascular events.
Intensified antithrombotic approach using rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid on
top of aspirin may be proposed in this setting, in the absence of high
bleeding risk.

Antiplatelet therapy is the mainstay of antithrombotic strategy in
patients with symptomatic LEAD. Rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid should be
proposed on top of low-dose aspirin in stable patients with chronic
symptomatic LEAD, without conditions at high risk of bleeding.*
If SAPT is planned, clopidogrel may be preferred over aspirin.
There is no clear evidence in favour of long-term DAPT in chronic
symptomatic LEAD.
Clopidogrel on top of aspirin is not proven to have beneficial effect on
graft patency and is associated with increased bleeding risk in patients
following vascular surgery.
Low-dose aspirin and rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid should be proposed in
patients undergoing revascularization (surgical or endovascular) for
LEAD with no increased risk of bleeding.*

Long-term antithrombotic
treatment for asymptomatic
lower extremity artery disease
Asymptomatic LEAD, identified by low ankle-brachial index, is at
increased risk of MACE and MALE.78,87 However, two trials failed to
show benefit of long-term aspirin in this setting (Table 2).74,75 In the
COMPASS trial, among patients included based on CAD, 1422 had
also asymptomatic LEAD.88 In this group, the favourable results of
DPI regarding MACE (HR 0.73; 95% CI 0.45-1.18), and MALE (HR
0.74; 95% CI 0.46-1.18) were similar to the whole trial, with no interaction. Nevertheless, the results cannot be extrapolated to patients
with asymptomatic LEAD and no associated clinical atherosclerotic
disease.

Long-term antithrombotic
treatment for symptomatic LEAD
In symptomatic LEAD, antiplatelet drugs improve cardiovascular
prognosis (Table 2).12,16,18,76,78,79,87 Current guidelines recommend
low-dose aspirin or clopidogrel.1 In the CAPRIE study, clopidogrel
was superior to aspirin in reducing MACE in patients with clinical
LEAD (HR 0.74; 95% CI 0.64-0.91).18 The EUCLID trial enrolled 13
885 patients with symptomatic LEAD and found no difference in
MACE between ticagrelor and clopidogrel.79 In addition, the risk of
acute limb ischaemia did not differ between the two groups.89
Regarding DAPT, the CHARISMA trial (Table 2) showed a nonsignificant trend for MACE reduction in the subgroup of 3096 LEAD
patients under aspirin th clopidogrel vs. aspirin alone.76
Vorapaxar was tested on top of aspirin and/or clopidogrel in the
TRA2P-TIMI 50 trial.90 In 20 170 patients with history of myocardial
infarction or symptomatic LEAD, a significant 17% risk reduction of

Antithrombotic therapies in aortic and peripheral arterial diseases

MACE was reported, without heterogeneity between the two
groups (Table 2). In those with LEAD, a significant reduction in ALI
and amputation was found under vorapaxar, at the cost of significant
excess of major and intracranial bleeding (Table 2).78 This drug is not
available in the European market.
The COMPASS trial reported a significant reduction in MACE
and MALE under rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid th aspirin in the overall
study population of CAD and/or PAD (n = 27 395),88 as well as in
those with symptomatic LEAD.16 This combination resulted in an
increase in major bleeding (but neither fatal nor intracranial bleeding), but the benefits outweighed the risks, especially in patients
with diabetes, renal dysfunction, heart failure, or polyvascular
disease.91,92

Antithrombotic therapy after
surgical bypass procedures
About one-third of lower extremity vein grafts develop conduit and/
or anastomotic lesions, threatening their patency. Venous bypass
thrombosis occurs mostly within the first year.93 The risk is greater
with smaller calibre conduits, non-saphenous veins, and when anastomosis is infra-popliteal. While antiplatelet agents are commonly used,
there is no robust evidence on which antithrombotic strategy is most
effective to maintain vein graft patency.81-83 The CASPAR trial
showed no benefit of aspirin th clopidogrel vs. aspirin alone in

patients undergoing below knee bypass graft after 1-year follow-up
(Table 2).83 Warfarin can be considered in patients at low bleeding
risk but with high risk conduits (e.g. poor runoff, or redo procedure)
based on a weak evidence for improved patency (Bypass Oral anticoagulants or Aspirin trial) (Table 2).82
Long-term patency of infra-inguinal prosthetic grafts is lower than
venous ones.93 Subgroup analysis of the CASPAR trial suggested that
DAPT confers benefit for prosthetic graft occlusion, revascularization, amputation or death without increasing significantly major
bleeding.83 VKAs did not improve prosthetic graft patency, though
they were slightly beneficial in venous conduits.82,94 A single centre
retrospective study suggested that VKAs could be associated with
prolonged patency of at risk prosthetic grafts due to poor run off
(Table 2).95

Antithrombotic therapy after
endovascular procedures
The choice, dose, and duration of antithrombotic drug therapy in relation to endovascular procedures is unclear. A Cochrane metaanalysis including 3529 patients evaluated antithrombotic drugs for
prevention of restenosis or reocclusion.96 No reduction was found
with aspirin plus dipyridamole vs. aspirin plus placebo (OR 0.69; 95%
CI 0.44-1.10). DAPT is often used after endovascular procedures
with large variability regarding its duration, usually between 1 and

Dual pathway inhibition after
peripheral revascularization
The VOYAGER-PAD trial assessed safety and efficacy of DPI (rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid th aspirin) vs. aspirin, initiated within 10 days
after revascularization, in 6564 patients undergoing surgical or
endovascular lower-extremity revascularization (Table 2).80
Additional clopidogrel was allowed at investigators discretion for
up to 6 months. Over a median follow-up of 28 months, the primary efficacy endpoint (acute limb ischaemia (ALI), major amputation, myocardial infarction (MI), ischaemic stroke, or cardiovascular
death) rate was significantly reduced under DPI vs. aspirin (15.5%
vs. 17.8%, P = 0.009). Regarding safety, TIMI major bleeding,
occurred in 2.65% in the DPI group and in 1.87% in the aspirin
group (P = 0.07). Projecting the results to a population of 10 000
patients, the DPI strategy would have prevented 181 primary efficacy events at the cost of 29 TIMI major bleeding events per year.
Approximately 50% of patients also received clopidogrel in both
arms of the trial, mostly after endovascular therapy. The beneficial
effect of the DPI was independent of clopidogrel (primary endpoint: HR 0.85; 95% CI 0.71-1.01 with clopidogrel, vs. HR 0.86;
95% CI 0.73-1.01 without clopidogrel). The primary safety outcome did not differ in both situations (HR 1.32; 95% CI 0.78-2.24
with clopidogrel, vs. HR 1.55; 95% CI 0.88-2.73 without clopidogrel). Major bleeding (ISTH criteria) risk was higher when clopidogrel was given for more than 1 month and increasing over time.100
Since the addition of clopidogrel was not randomized, there are
currently no data for a head-to-head comparison between DPI and
DAPT (aspirin th clopidogrel) strategies. The latter has been empirically implemented for endovascular therapy and secondarily recommended based on expert opinion, while the former has been
validated in the VOYAGER trial.80 Also, the DPI strategy can be

Renal and mesenteric arteries
Key messages: Antithrombotic therapies in renal and mesenteric artery
diseases
o SAPT is indicated for cardiovascular prevention in patients with
atherosclerotic renal or mesenteric artery stenosis.

o DAPT, for at least 1 month, is proposed after renal or mesenteric
artery stenting.

Data on antithrombotic therapies in patients who suffer from renal
or mesenteric artery atherosclerotic disease are scarce, but their use
is reasonable based on the elevated cardiovascular risk in patients
with any atherosclerotic disease (see Supplementary material online).101-105

Patients with peripheral arterial
disease and concomitant
indication for oral anticoagulation
Key messages: Antithrombotic strategies in patients with PAD and other
indications requiring anticoagulation.
o When full-dose OACs are indicated for other conditions in patients

o

with chronic PAD, the addition of antiplatelet therapy should
generally be avoided because of bleeding risk, unless a recent
percutaneous revascularization was performed.106
SAPT in addition to OAC may be prescribed in patients at high
thrombotic risk, taking the bleeding risk into consideration.

Patients with PAD may have other conditions requiring transient/permanent anticoagulation. Patients with LEAD are at increased risk of
AF,107 an arrhythmia observed in >10% of patients hospitalized for
LEAD and associated with increased risk of stroke, amputation and
mortality.108,109 Patients with AF and PAD have per definition a
CHA2DS2-VASc score >_1 and so qualify for OAC. Comparing rivaroxaban to warfarin in patients with AF, the ROCKET AF showed
similar benefits in terms of primary outcome in those with LEAD,
with increased bleeding with rivaroxaban vs. VKA (HR 1.40; 95% CI
1.06-1.86, interaction P = 0.037).110 However, no significant difference in major bleeding was found with rivaroxaban vs. VKA in
patients with CAD or LEAD in a retrospective study (HR 1.13; 95%
CI 0.84-1.52),111 as well as with apixaban vs. VKA in the LEAD

3 months.97 The ESC guidelines on PAD recommend DAPT (aspirin
th clopidogrel) for at least 1 month after infra-inguinal stent implantation.1 Stenting of infra-popliteal arteries is often followed by a longer
DAPT duration, without available evidence.
DAPT duration is primarily based on extrapolation from coronary
stenting which might not be adequate: higher residual platelet reactivity in response to adenosine diphosphate and arachidonic acid were
found in LEAD vs. CAD patients.98 Patients undergoing peripheral
angioplasty may have a weaker response to aspirin and clopidogrel
compared to percutaneous coronary intervention patients.98 The
MIRROR trial randomized 80 patients undergoing femoro-popliteal
endovascular intervention in two arms: aspirin vs. DAPT.85 At
6 months, there was a significant reduction in target lesion revascularization (TLR) in the DAPT group (Table 2). The patients received
thereafter aspirin alone and the initial difference in TLR was no longer
apparent at 12 months. A recent retrospective analysis of 693
patients receiving endovascular revascularization showed that DAPT
>_6 months was an independent predictor of reduced risk for MACE
(HR 0.61; 95% CI 0.40-0.93) and MALE (HR 0.55; 95% CI 0.38-0.77),
without significant increase in major bleeding.99 In one RCT, cilostazol plus aspirin improved 3-year vascular patency vs. ticlopidine plus
aspirin (Table 2).84 Yet, cilostazol is currently not labelled for antithrombotic properties in Europe.

Bleeding risk in patients with PAD
Bleeding risk evaluation is necessary before antithrombotic therapies
initiation. Patients with PAD are generally at higher risk of bleeding as
compared to average CAD patients.117,118 although data on the
bleeding risk in patients with PAD are limited. Scores such as HASBLED showed poor prognostic performances in these patients.119
Recently the Academic Research Consortium High Bleeding Risk
(ARC-HBR) score has been validated as a bleeding prediction tool in
CAD patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention,120
but not yet assessed in PADs. Few attempts have been made to propose bleeding risk scores for PAD patients, summarized in Table
3.118,119,121-123 Only one study assessed the interest of proton pump
inhibitors to reduce gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with PAD:
the COMPASS trial found no significant decrease in upper gastrointestinal events as a composite primary endpoint (HR 0.88; 95% CI
0.67-1.15), but showed reduction in bleeding secondary to gastrointestinal lesions under pantoprazole as a secondary endpoint (HR
0.52; 95% CI 0.28-0.94).124

subgroup of the ARISTOTLE trial (HR 1.05; 95% CI 0.69-1.58).112 In
a nationwide cohort study in Taiwan, lower bleeding rates were
reported with non-VKA oral anticoagulants (NOACs) vs. VKA (HR
0.64; 95% CI 0.50-0.80), possibly related to the lower doses used in
Chinese patients.113 In the absence of specific trials in patients with
AF and PAD, NOACs remain preferred to VKAs.114
There is no solid rationale to add antiplatelet therapy (APT) to
OACs in AF patients with PAD. A study including 14 199 hospitalized
patients with AF, heart failure and coexisting CAD or PAD showed
that adding APT to VKA did not reduce ischaemic events vs. VKA
alone, but increased the bleeding risk.106 In an RCT for CAD patients
with AF, the addition of APT on top of OAC in AF patients with
CAD did not reduce MACE but increased bleeding.115 We therefore
suggest to avoid routine addition of APT in patients with PAD requiring full dose OACs.
In case of peripheral stenting, evidence on the optimal antithrombotic regimen is lacking. We suggest short-term SAPT in patients
receiving full dose OACs. The duration of this combination should be
as limited as possible (1 month), depending on the clinical indication
and bleeding risk; in case of high bleeding risk, the lowest NOAC
dose approved for stroke prevention should be applied.114 Recently,
a meta-analysis of the four RCTs comparing the combination of a
NOAC and clopidogrel vs. triple therapy with VKA, aspirin and clopidogrel in patients undergoing coronary stenting showed that dual
therapy reduces bleeding by 34%, albeit increasing the stent thrombosis risk by 59%.116 Notably, major and/or clinically relevant bleeding events were >3 times more frequent than ischaemic events.
Extrapolating this evidence to PADs, a condition for which the risk of
occlusive stent thrombosis is generally lower, we suggest treating AF
patients undergoing peripheral artery stenting with a NOAC plus clopidogrel for 1 month, adding 1-month aspirin (i.e. triple therapy) only
in selected cases at highest risk of stent thrombosis (e.g. previous
stent thrombosis, severe slow flow at the end of intervention).
Conversely, if bleeding risk is high, OAC alone should be prescribed.
