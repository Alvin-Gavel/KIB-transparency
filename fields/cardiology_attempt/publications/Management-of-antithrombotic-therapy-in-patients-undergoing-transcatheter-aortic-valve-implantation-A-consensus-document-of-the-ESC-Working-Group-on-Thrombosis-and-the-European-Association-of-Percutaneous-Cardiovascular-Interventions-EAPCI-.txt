Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is effective in older patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis, while the indication
has recently broadened to younger patients at lower risk. Although thromboembolic and bleeding complications after TAVI have
decreased over time, such adverse events are still common. The recommendations of the latest 2017 ESC/EACTS Guidelines for the management of valvular heart disease on antithrombotic therapy in patients undergoing TAVI are mostly based on expert opinion. Based on

Introduction
Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is effective in older
patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis, while the indication
has recently broadened to lower risk and younger patients.1,2
Thromboembolic and bleeding complications are frequent, thus an
optimal antithrombotic regimen peri- and post-TAVI is of utmost
importance.
The 2017 ESC/EACTS guidelines recommend either dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT, low-dose aspirin plus clopidogrel) for 3-
6 months post-TAVI, followed by life-long single antiplatelet therapy
(IIa), or oral anticoagulation (OAC) for patients with other indications for OAC (Ia).1 The 2020 ACC/AHA guidelines recommend

life-long low-dose aspirin post-TAVI (IIa), while aspirin plus clopidogrel or vitamin K anticoagulation (VKA) for 3-6 months are options in
patients with low bleeding risk (IIb).2
Based on recent studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs),
this viewpoint document provides updated therapeutic insights into
antithrombotic treatment peri- and post-TAVI.

Antithrombotic therapy in patients undergoing TAVI

Antithrombotic therapy peritranscatheter aortic valve
implantation
Low-dose aspirin is the treatment of choice, usually started preTAVI, in patients without OAC indication. Moreover, the BRAVO-3
trial showed no additional reduction of thromboembolic events periTAVI in patients on maintenance clopidogrel or loaded pre-TAVI.6 In
patients on OAC, the effect of OAC on peri-TAVI thromboembolic
events is unknown. However, continuing VKA or non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC) during TAVI seems safe, as an
observational study did not show increased bleeding, transfusion, or
vascular complications as compared with (N)OAC interruption.7
When (N)OAC is continued during TAVI, peri-procedural aspirin is
usually not needed.
During TAVI, unfractionated heparin (UFH) is routinely used [reference activated clotting time [ACT] 250-300 s] to reduce catheter
thrombosis and thromboembolism. Bivalirudin is an alternative in
patients with contraindications to UFH. To prevent vascular accesssite complications and bleedings, protamine sulphate may be used before closure to reverse anticoagulation.

Antithrombotic treatment posttranscatheter aortic valve
implantation in patients without
oral anticoagulant indication
Observational studies and a small RCT reported no difference in
thromboembolic events between aspirin plus clopidogrel and aspirin
alone, but DAPT increased major bleeding.8 The POPular TAVI RCT
(cohort A) confirmed that aspirin alone reduced bleeding compared
with aspirin plus clopidogrel. Bleeding occurred in 50 patients
(15.1%) receiving aspirin alone and in 89 (26.6%) receiving aspirin
plus clopidogrel [risk ratio (RR) 0.57; 95% confidence interval (CI)

0.42-0.77; P = 0.001], while the composite of cardiovascular death,
stroke, or MI for aspirin alone was non-inferior to aspirin plus clopidogrel (9.7% and 9.9%, P = 0.004 for non-inferiority).5 Based on this
RCT, we consider low-dose aspirin as preferred over aspirin plus clopidogrel post-TAVI in patients without OAC indication.
The recent GALILEO trial randomized patients without OAC indication to low-dose rivaroxaban (10 mg) plus aspirin for 3 months, followed by rivaroxaban alone vs. aspirin plus clopidogrel for 3 months,
followed by aspirin alone. The trial was terminated early for a significant 69% relative increase in all-cause mortality, 50% increase in
Valve Academic Research Consortium (VARC)-2 major, life-threatening or disabling bleeding, and 35% increase in the composite of
death and thromboembolic events.3 Thus, current evidence does not
support rivaroxaban plus aspirin after TAVI in patients without an
OAC indication.

Antithrombotic treatment posttranscatheter aortic valve
implantation in patients with oral
anticoagulant indication
Almost all patients with AF undergoing TAVI (prevalence 40%)
have an indication for OAC based on the CHA2DS2-VASc score.
Whether TAVI patients are best treated with VKA or NOAC is unknown. Current AF guidelines recommend NOACs over VKA in
NOAC-eligible patients (class Ia, ).9 Observational data show inconsistent results regarding the thromboembolic risk associated with
NOACs post-TAVI. A Danish registry showed similar risk of
thromboembolism, bleeding, or all-cause mortality post-TAVI among
NOAC and VKA.10 A German registry demonstrated higher all-cause
mortality, MI, and cerebrovascular events at 1 year with NOAC vs.
VKA.11 Therefore, evidence supporting NOAC over VKA after TAVI
in AF patients is currently lacking.
In an observational study in AF patients, VKA alone reduced major
or life-threatening bleeding in comparison to VKA and aspirin with
comparable ischaemic events.12 The POPular TAVI (cohort B)
randomized AF patients undergoing TAVI to (N)OAC alone or to
(N)OAC plus clopidogrel for 3 months. Bleeding was significantly
lower with (N)OAC alone vs. (N)OAC plus clopidogrel (21.7% vs.
34.6%; RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.43-0.90, P = 0.01), while the composite of
cardiovascular death, stroke, or MI was non-inferior (13.4% and
17.3%, respectively; 95% CI for non-inferiority, -11.9 to 4.0).4 Based
on this RCT, we consider OAC alone as preferred over OAC plus
clopidogrel after TAVI in patients with OAC indication.
Finally, left atrial appendage closure may be considered in patients
with clear contraindication to OAC.

percutaneous coronary
intervention
Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is frequently (20%) performed shortly before, during, or after TAVI. According to the ESC

tissue, and foreign material. Although embolic protection devices reduce peri-TAVI silent brain infarct, they have not improved outcome.
Later-occurring stroke is thromboembolic, originating from the TAVI
bioprosthesis or due to atrial fibrillation (AF). Also, TAVI valve
thrombosis occurs, which is seldom symptomatic (1-3%).3,5 Despite
frequent concomitant coronary artery disease, peri-TAVI myocardial
infarction (MI) is rare (1-3%).3-5 Overall thromboembolic incidences
are depicted in Supplementary material online, Table S1.
Also, major life-threatening and disabling bleeding frequently
occurs in 3-11% within the 1st year.3-5 Of these, 50% is procedurerelated despite improvements in access-site assessment by computed
tomography (CT), ultrasound-guided puncture, smaller bore catheters, and low-profile suture-closure devices.5 The older age of TAVI
patients, their comorbidities, frequent presence of acquired von
Willebrand factor defect and moderate thrombocytopenia postTAVI, all increase bleeding risk and should be considered when
choosing optimal antithrombotic therapy. Furthermore, bleeding risk
assessment pre- and periodically post-TAVI is mandatory.

2268

Transcatheter aortic valve
implantation valve thrombosis
Transcatheter aortic valve implantation valve thrombosis rarely leads
to heart failure due to increased transvalvular gradients (1-3%).3-5 In
recent CT studies, subclinical leaflet thrombosis was identified in up
to a quarter of patients on antiplatelet therapy, and there is evidence
that (N)OAC effectively prevents and reverses leaflet thrombosis.14,15 However, subclinical leaflet thrombosis may also regress
spontaneously without changing antithrombotic therapy. Some observational studies showed an increase in thromboembolic events in
patients with subclinical leaflet thrombosis, but this was not confirmed in the GALILEO and other studies. The PARTNER-3-CT substudy only showed a slightly higher valvular gradient when subclinical
leaflet thrombosis was present, both at 1 and 12 months. These CT
series are, however, too small to conclude a detrimental impact of
leaflet thrombosis on valve function or clinical outcome and there is
no evidence to support routine CT for detection of subclinical leaflet
thrombosis post-TAVI.

Consensus statements for optimal
antithrombotic therapy peri- and
post-transcatheter aortic valve
implantation
The choice of antithrombotic therapy should be based on both TAVI
procedure and patients' characteristics, comorbidities, and/or comedications that predispose to bleeding and thrombosis. Below we
provide consensus statements for optimal antithrombotic therapy
based on the latest evidence (Graphical Abstract).

o In patients without OAC indication, low-dose aspirin should be
started pre-TAVI.

o In case of contraindication for aspirin, clopidogrel should be used.

Peri-transcatheter aortic valve
implantation
o Vitamin K anticoagulation or NOAC continuation or interruption
should be decided on an individual basis.

o When VKA is continued, the international normalized ratio should
be at the inferior limit of the therapeutic range (2).

o Additional aspirin is not needed in OAC-treated patients.
o Unfractionated heparin with ACT of 250-300 s is preferred.
o (ACT-guided) reversal of UFH with protamine sulphate is
reasonable.

o Bivalirudin is an alternative if UFH is contraindicated.
o Use of embolic protection devices is reasonable in patients at high
risk of stroke.

Post-transcatheter aortic valve
implantation
o Periodical re-assessment of the bleeding risk is mandatory.
o Low-dose aspirin is preferred in the absence of OAC indication.
o Vitamin K anticoagulation or NOAC alone is preferred when
there is an indication for OAC.

o After coronary stenting, if the bleeding risk is high, DAPT should
be shortened to 1-3 months in case of CCS and to 3-6 months
in case of ACS.
o After coronary stenting in patients on OAC, if the bleeding risk is
high, clopidogrel should be shortened to 1-3 months in case of
CCS and to 3-6 months in case of ACS.
o When coronary stenting is performed within 3 months pre-TAVI,
continuing the indicated DAPT or OAC plus clopidogrel periTAVI should be considered.

guidelines, DAPT is recommended after stenting, for 6 months in
chronic coronary syndrome (CCS) and 12 months in acute coronary
syndrome (ACS). In patients at high bleeding risk, DAPT duration
could be shortened to 1-3 months for CCS and to 3-6 months for
ACS.13 Therefore, in most TAVI patients, we consider shorter DAPT
duration preferable, due to underlying high bleeding risk. In TAVI
patients with an indication for OAC, the optimal antithrombotic regimen post-stenting is complex. Current guidelines recommend the
combination of NOAC plus clopidogrel with a very short period of
aspirin (triple therapy, duration varying from only during PCI to
1 month), only in patients with high thrombotic risk.13 In the absence
of direct evidence, the duration of dual therapy should follow postPCI recommendations, but should again be as short as possible (1-
6 months) based on the bleeding risk. When TAVI is performed early
post-PCI, it is unknown whether antithrombotic therapy should be
continued peri-TAVI, but expert opinion advices continuing when
PCI has been performed within 3 months because the risk for stent
thrombosis is highest within this timeframe.
