In 1955, I began my third cardiology fellowship (I was a slow learner) in the
Cardiovascular Physiology Laboratory directed by the noted physiologist
Stanley J. Sarnoff, in the National Heart Institute (now the NHLBI). One of
the other major laboratories in the institute at the time, located on the
same floor of the building in which I worked, was focused on lipid biochemistry and the possible relations between dyslipidaemias and coronary artery
disease. The senior scientist of the group was Christian B. Anfinsen, a noted
biochemist, who was on his way to win a Nobel Prize in Chemistry. When
I left the institute in 1968, I had been thoroughly indoctrinated into the lipid
hypothesis of atherogenesis and I was convinced of its validity, even though
it was not yet accepted by most clinicians, including cardiologists.1 Our
group carried out only a single study in the field, in which we demonstrated
in patients with severe hypertriglyceridaemia and peripheral arterial disease
that correction of the dyslipidaemia improved blood flow in the legs,2 suggesting that reduction of hyperlipidaemia might be beneficial in patients
with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Although my major
research efforts at the time focused on reduction of myocardial infarct size,
this clinical study whetted my appetite to look further into potential treatments of dyslipidaemias and I waited for the right opportunity to do so. It
was a long wait.
Gradually the clinical evidence for the critical role of cholesterol and of
the benefits of cholesterol lowering became accepted. In the USA, the beneficial results of reduction in the Lipid Research Clinics Coronary Primary
Prevention trial in 1984 attracted attention.3 This was followed by a formal
consensus conference entitled 'Lowering blood cholesterol to prevent
coronary artery disease',4 and by the report of the European
Atherosclerosis Society Study Group on this subject.5
I became energized about the clinical management of atherosclerosis
when, in 1976, Akira Endo, a Japanese pharmacologist, described, in a three
page paper in an obscure journal, the first HMGCoA reductase inhibitor
which markedly reduced cholesterol.6 This was truly a breakthrough (a
term I use rarely). The first large, placebo-controlled secondary prevention
statin trial was the 4S trial conducted in patients with ASCVD and markedly elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (avg
4.9 mmol/L).7 When I learned about the details of the trial, I was convinced
that it would be positive, but because the baseline LDL-C levels were
much higher than was seen in a large fraction of patients with ASCVD in
the USA and other industrialized countries, it would not be directly

applicable to them. As expected, 4S was a resounding success. The LDL-C
fell by 35% to 3.2 mmol/L, major adverse coronary events (MACE) declined by 34% (Figure 1), and total mortality by 30%. Quite appropriately,
4S became a 'landmark' trial overnight.
Shortly after enrolment of patients into 4S was begun, my colleagues
Frank Sacks, Marc Pfeffer, and I convinced the Squibb (now the BristolMyers Squibb) Corporation to test their new statin, pravastatin, against placebo in patients who had experienced a myocardial infarction, whose conditions were stable and whose LDL-C was similar to the national average
for patients with coronary artery disease at the time. The CARE trial began
in 1989, 5 years before the 4S trial was reported. At randomization,
patients in CARE had an average LDL-C of 3.6 mmol/L. Pravastatin reduced
it by 30% to 2.5 mmol/L; MACE, the primary endpoint, was significantly
reduced.8
It was apparent from 4S and CARE that lowering LDL-C was certainly
beneficial for secondary prevention of ASCVD. However, we wondered
whether greater lowering would be more effective. We therefore compared pravastatin with the more powerful atorvastatin in the PROVE-ITTIMI 22 trial, led by Christopher P. Cannon. We enrolled a high-risk postacute coronary syndrome population and compared pravastatin 40 mg/
day, the dose used in CARE, with atorvastatin 80 mg/day, the highest approved dose. The LDL-C was 2.7 mmol/L at baseline and fell to 1.6 mmol/L
on atorvastatin. This intensive reduction of LDL-C was significantly more
effective in reducing MACE than the moderate effects of pravastatin,9 with
the greater clinical benefit apparent by 2 weeks.
When I presented the results of PROVE-IT to a group of lipidologists, I was asked whether the marked reduction of LDL-C that we
produced with atorvastatin was safe. I was quite surprised by the question because the mindset for decades had been to lower LDL-C. I was
quickly reminded that cholesterol is a critical component of cell membranes and a variety of biochemical reactions including the biosynthesis
of several hormones and vitamins. In PROVE-IT, there were 193
patients, 10.5% of those in the atorvastatin arm, who achieved LDL-C
levels of <1.04 mmol/L, a level far below the guideline-directed target
at the time of 1.8 mmol/L. The analyses of these patients by Stephen D.
Wiviott showed that these levels were not associated with any adverse
effects but appeared to be associated with a trend to greater efficacy.10
We breathed a sigh of relief.

have occurred in this field since 1955 when I was first exposed to

Encouraged by the results of PROVE-IT, we wondered whether even
lower LDL-C levels were safe and even more effective. The IMPROVE-ITTIMI 40 trial, also led by Christopher Cannon, showed that the addition of
ezetimibe, a blocker of cholesterol absorption, to simvastatin reduced
LDL-C further and improved clinical outcomes, particularly in high-risk
patients.11 In this trial, 971 patients had LDL-C < 0.78 mmol/L, even lower
than in PROVE-IT; our colleague Robert P. Giugliano reported that these
levels were well tolerated without detectable adverse effects and, when
adjusted for baseline variables, exhibited enhanced efficacy.12
In the FOURIER-TIMI 59 trial on patients with chronic ASCVD led by
Marc S. Sabatine, patients received a statin and the addition of placebo or a
PCSK9 inhibitor evolocumab, which lowered LDL-C to an average of
0.78 mmol/L and reduced MACE significantly.13 Giugliano et al. reported
that 2669 patients, 20.5% of those in the evolocumab arm, achieved an
LDL-C < 0.50 mmol/L; this subgroup had a median level of 0.36 mmol/L
with an IQR of 0.28-0.44 mmol/L. Once again, no safety concerns were observed even in patients with 'ultra-low' levels of LDL-C (0.28 mmol/L).14
Thus, it appears that the 'bottom' had been pretty well reached. It was
reassuring that the trial which studied alirocumab, a different PCSK9 inhibitor, added to a statin in patients post-acute coronary syndrome also
showed that the marked reductions in LDL-C were not associated with
any apparent adverse effects.15

Comment
It is interesting to compare the LDL-C concentration of 3.2 mmol/L in
the active treatment arm of the 4S trial with that of 0.78 mmol/L in the
active treatment arm of FOURIER-TIMI 59,3 a 75% reduction over
23 years, accompanied by a substantial clinical benefit. Although there
have been recurrent questions about the safety of these very low levels of LDL-C, there should have been little surprise that they have
proved to be safe. Living hunter/gatherer populations have total cholesterol levels between 100 and 130 mg/dL and appear to develop very
little atherosclerosis, while newborn infants normally have similar levels at a time of rapid brain development.16 Also, a number of rare genetic conditions are characterized by ultra-low LDL-C without
apparent adverse effect.17
For me, this race to the bottom has been an exhilarating experience.
While there certainly are additional opportunities for attacking

(1) There is substantial evidence that low levels of LDL-C (<0.5 mmol/L)
and even ultra-low levels (<0.3 mmol/L) are well tolerated and safe.
(2) In secondary prevention trials, these low levels might be more
effective in reducing MACE than the common guideline target levels
of 1.8 and 1.4 mmol/L for high-risk and very high-risk patients,
respectively.18
(3) It would be desirable and safe to conduct a prospective randomized
trial to compare clinical effectiveness at three target levels: 1.4, 0.9,
and 0.4 mmol/L.

Comment on 'Empagliflozin in heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction' published in the New England Journal of Medicine (DOI: 10.1056/
NEJMoa2107038).

Key Points
o The EMPEROR-Preserved (Empagliflozin Outcome Trial in Patients with Chronic Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction)1 (HFpEF)
was an industry-sponsored and -funded, double-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT), carried out to evaluate the efficacy of empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose transporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) in patients with HFpEF.
o A total of 5988 patients (49% with diabetes) with NYHA class II-IV HF and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of >40% were randomized to receive empagliflozin 10 mg (n  1/4  2997) or placebo (n  1/4  2991) in addition to usual therapy. The primary outcome was a composite of adjudicated cardiovascular (CV) death or hospitalization for HF. The first secondary outcome was the occurrence of all
adjudicated hospitalizations for HF, including first and recurrent events. The second secondary outcome was the rate of decline in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). The median duration of follow-up was 26.2 months.
o A primary composite outcome event occurred in 415 patients (13.8%) in the empagliflozin group and in 511 patients (17.1%) in the placebo group [6.9 vs. 8.7 events per 100 patient-years; hazard ratio (HR), 0.79; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.69-0.90; P < 0.001].
Hospitalization for HF occurred in 259 patients (8.6%) in the empagliflozin group and in 352 patients (11.8%) in the placebo group (HR,
0.71; 95% CI, 0.60-0.83). Death from CV causes occurred in 219 patients (7.3%) in the empagliflozin group and in 244 patients (8.2%) in
the placebo group (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.76-1.09). The effects were consistent across prespecified subgroups, including the presence or absence of diabetes at baseline. Empagliflozin reduced the decline in the eGFR compared to placebo (1.25 vs 2.62 mL/min/1.73 m2 per
year; P < 0.001).
o Uncomplicated genital and urinary tract infections and hypotension were more common in patients treated with empagliflozin.
Discontinuation of therapy occurred in about 23% of patients in both groups.
