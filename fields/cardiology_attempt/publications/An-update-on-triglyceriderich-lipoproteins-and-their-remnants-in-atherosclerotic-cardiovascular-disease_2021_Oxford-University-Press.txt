Residual cardiovascular risk in patients on optimized LDL-lowering
therapy remains a hot topic. While inflammation explains part of the
residual risk,1-3 triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and their remnants also
may play an important role.4-6 This Focus Issue on dyslipidaemias
contains the Special Article entitled 'Triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and their remnants: metabolic insights, role in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and emerging therapeutic
strategies-a consensus statement from the European
Atherosclerosis Society' by Henry Ginsberg from Columbia
University in New York, NY, USA.7 The authors point out that recent advances in human genetics, together with a large body of epidemiological, pre-clinical, and clinical trial results, provide strong
support for a causal association between triglycerides (TG), TG-rich
lipoproteins (TRLs), and TRL remnants, and increased risk of myocardial infarction (MI), ischaemic stroke, and aortic valve stenosis. This
consensus statement critically appraises current understanding of the
structure, function, and metabolism of TRLs, and their pathophysiological role in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Key
points are: (i) a working definition of normo- and hypertriglyceridaemic states and their relationship to risk of ASCVD; (ii) a conceptual
framework for the generation of remnants due to dysregulation of
TRL production, lipolysis, and remodelling, as well as clearance of
remnant lipoproteins from the circulation; (iii) the pleiotropic proatherogenic actions of TRLs and remnants at the arterial wall; (iv) challenges in defining, quantifying, and assessing the atherogenic
properties of remnant particles; and (v) exploration of the relative
atherogenicity of TRLs and remnants compared with LDL.
Assessment of these issues provides a foundation for evaluating
approaches to effectively reduce levels of TRLs and remnants by

targeting either production, lipolysis, or hepatic clearance, or a combination of these mechanisms. This consensus statement updates current understanding in an integrated manner, thereby providing a
platform for new therapeutic paradigms targeting TRLs and their
remnants, with the aim of reducing the risk of ASCVD.
The role of omega-3 fatty acids in the prevention of cardiovascular
risk remains controversial.8 In a Fast Track article entitled 'A possible explanation for the contrasting results of REDUCE-IT
vs. STRENGTH: cohort study mimicking trial designs',
Takahito Doi from the Copenhagen University Hospital in Denmark,
and colleagues tested the hypothesis that the contrasting results for
the effect of high-dose, purified omega-3 fatty acids on the prevention
of ASCVD in two randomized trials, Reduction of Cardiovascular
Events with Icosapent Ethyl-Intervention Trial (REDUCE-IT) vs.
Long-Term Outcomes Study to Assess Statin Residual Risk with
Epanova in High Cardiovascular Risk Patients with Hypertriglyceridaemia (STRENGTH), can be explained by differences in the effect of
active and comparator oils on lipid traits and C-reactive protein.9 In
the Copenhagen General Population Study (CGPS) with 106 088
individuals, to mimic trial designs, the authors analysed those who
met key inclusion criteria in REDUCE-IT (n = 5684; ASCVD = 852)
and STRENGTH (n = 6862; ASCVD = 697). The incidence of
ASCVD was followed for the median durations of REDUCE-IT and
STRENGTH (4.9 and 3.5 years, respectively). When combining
changes in plasma triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, and C-reactive protein observed in the active oil groups of the original studies, estimated
hazard ratios (HRs) for ASCVD in the CGPS were 0.96 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93-0.99] mimicking REDUCE-IT, and 0.94 (95%
CI 0.91-0.98) mimicking STRENGTH. In the comparator oil groups,
corresponding HRs were 1.07 (95% CI 1.04-1.10) and 0.99 (95% CI
0.98-0.99). Combining these results, the active oil vs. comparator oil
HR was 0.88 (95% CI 0.84-0.93) in the CGPS mimicking REDUCE-

IT, compared with 0.75 (95% CI 0.68-0.83) in the REDUCE-IT. The
corresponding HR was 0.96 (95% CI 0.93-0.99) in the CGPS mimicking STRENGTH, compared with 0.99 (95% CI 0.90-1.09) in
STRENGTH (Figure 1).
The authors conclude that the contrasting results of REDUCE-IT
vs. STRENGTH can partly be explained by a difference in the effect
of comparator oils (mineral vs. corn), but not of active oils [eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) vs. EPA th docosahexaenoic acid], on lipid
traits and C-reactive protein. The contribution is accompanied by an
Editorial by Kevin Maki from the School of Public Health
Bloomington in Indiana, USA.10 In conclusion, Maki points out that
current European guidelines recommend consideration of icosapent
ethyl in combination with statin therapy for high- and veryhigh-risk patients with triglyceride concentrations in the range of
135-499 mg/dL (1.5-5.6 mmol/L) despite statin treatment for reduction of ASCVD risk, although important questions remain. Additional
randomized, controlled trials of ASCVD outcomes and surrogate
indicators, such as coronary plaque progression, will be needed to
further clarify the magnitude of the effect of icosapent ethyl on
ASCVD incidence, and the mechanisms responsible for such benefits.
Acute arterial vascular events in the coronary, cerebrovascular,
and peripheral beds are often critical or disabling, and represent the
most feared manifestations of atherosclerosis. While these acute
events across vascular territories share related underlying pathobiologies, the total burden of acute arterial events has rarely been
described in an at-risk cohort; nor has the aggregate impact of lipidlowering therapy on pan-vascular acute events been well described.
In another Fast Track article entitled 'Effect of evolocumab on
acute arterial events across all vascular territories: results
from the FOURIER trial', Kazuma Oyama from the Harvard
Medical School in Boston, MA, USA, and colleagues assessed the

impact of the proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9)
inhibitor evolocumab on acute arterial events across all vascular territories, including coronary, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular
beds, in patients with established ASCVD.11 In the FOURIER trial, 27
564 patients with stable ASCVD on statin therapy were randomly
assigned to evolocumab or placebo. Acute arterial events were a
composite of acute coronary (coronary heart disease death, MI, or
urgent coronary revascularization), cerebrovascular (ischaemic
stroke, transient ischaemic attack, or urgent cerebral revascularization), or peripheral vascular (acute limb ischaemia, major amputation,
or urgent peripheral revascularization) events. Of the 2210 first acute
arterial events, 74% were coronary, 22% were cerebrovascular, and
4% were peripheral vascular. Evolocumab reduced first acute arterial
events by 19% (HR 0.81; P < 0.001), with significant individual reductions in acute coronary (HR 0.83), cerebrovascular (HR 0.77), and
peripheral vascular (HR 0.58) events. There were 3437 total events
(first plus recurrent), with evolocumab reducing total events by 24%
(incidence rate ratio 0.76). The magnitude of reduction in acute arterial events with evolocumab numerically increased over time, with
a significant 16% reduction (HR 0.84) in the first year followed by a
24% reduction (HR 0.76) thereafter (Figure 2).
Oyama et al. conclude that the addition of the PCSK9 inhibitor
evolocumab to statin therapy reduces acute arterial events across
all vascular territories with a robust effect over time, indicating a
pan-vascular impact of aggressive lipid-lowering therapy on these
acute and clinically meaningful events. The manuscript is accompanied by a thought-provoking Editorial by Carl Orringer from the
University of Miami Miller School of Medicine in Florida, USA.12
Orringer notes that an expanded role for PCSK9 inhibitors to
treat acute arterial events is of great clinical interest. Yet, the apparently greater reported effect of evolocumab therapy on acute

cerebrovascular or peripheral vascular events observed by
Oyama may be related to the smaller number of events in those
vascular distributions as compared with coronary events. The
results of future randomized controlled trials will provide a more
definitive answer about whether such therapy provides a therapeutically beneficial and cost-effective approach to preventive
therapy in this very high risk population.
In a Clinical Research article entitled 'Directly measured vs.
calculated remnant cholesterol identifies additional overlooked individuals in the general population at higher risk
of myocardial infarction', Anette Varbo and Borge Nordestgaard
from the Copenhagen University Hospital in Denmark tested the hypothesis that high directly measured remnant cholesterol is associated with increased risk of IHD and MI in the general population.13
The authors also explored whether directly measured vs. calculated
remnant cholesterol is superior in identifying individuals at increased
risk. Overall, 16 207 individuals with both directly measured and calculated remnant cholesterol were followed up for 14 years to analyse
the risk for IHD and MI. Compared with individuals with both directly
measured and calculated remnant cholesterol <80th percentile (75%
of the whole population), those with only directly measured remnant
cholesterol >_80th percentile had a HR of 1.42 for IHD and of 1.83
for MI. Corresponding HRs for individuals with only calculated remnant cholesterol >_80th percentile (5%) were 1.14 and 1.14, respectively, and corresponding HRs for individuals with both directly

measured and calculated remnant cholesterol >_80th percentiles
(15%) were 1.48 and 1.67, respectively.
The authors conclude that directly measured vs. calculated remnant cholesterol identifies 5% of overlooked individuals in the general
population with cholesterol-rich, TG-poor remnants and 1.8-fold
increased risk of MI. This manuscript is accompanied by an interesting
Editorial by Alberico Luigi Catapano and Angela Pirillo from the
University of Milan in Italy.14 The authors conclude that the need for
a clear definition of remnants has raised its head. Further research is
warranted to obtain a recognized clinical method for accurate measurement of remnant cholesterol levels, which should include an indepth characterization of measured lipoproteins and the validation in
other populations. This will allow the comparison between studies
and the validation of remnant cholesterol as a potential target for
therapy.
Atherosclerosis is a chronic progressive inflammatory disease
involving the synergistic interaction of lipid metabolic factors with the
cellular components of the vessels. Formation of macrophagederived foam cells is the hallmark of atherosclerosis.15-17 During
atherogenesis, monocytes are differentiated into macrophages in the
subendothelial space and internalize oxidized LDLs (oxLDLs)
through scavenger receptors such as SR-A and CD36. The interplay
between the scavenger receptors and oxLDLs in macrophages induces the secretion of cytokines that recruit immune cells into the vascular wall. Increased uptake of oxLDLs and/or reduced cholesterol

efflux leads to lipid dysregulation in macrophages and promotes foam
cell formation, triggering a series of inflammatory responses, ultimately establishing plaque formation and atherosclerotic lesions. This
issue contains the Translational Research article entitled
'Macrophage NFATc3 prevents foam cell formation and
atherosclerosis: evidence and mechanisms', by Xiu Liu from
the Zhongshan School of Medicine in Guangzhou, China, and colleagues.18 This study investigated the specific role of macrophage
calcineurin-nuclear factor of activated T-cell (NFAT)c3 in atherogenesis. Macrophage-specific NFATc3 knockout mice were generated in
a mouse model of adeno-associated virus-mutant PCSK9-induced
atherosclerosis. NFATc3 deficiency in macrophages promoted foam
cell formation by potentiating SR-A- and CD36-mediated lipid uptake. NFATc3 directly targeted and transcriptionally up-regulated
miR-204 levels. Mature miR-204-5p suppressed SR-A expression via
canonical regulation. Restoration of miR-204 abolished the proatherogenic phenotype observed in the macrophage-specific NFATc3
knockout mice, and blockade of miR-204 function reversed the beneficial effects of NFATc3 in macrophages.
The authors conclude that macrophage NFATc3 up-regulates
miR-204 to reduce SR-A and CD36 levels, thereby preventing foam
cell formation and atherosclerosis, indicating that the NFATc3/miR204 axis may be a potential therapeutic target against atherosclerosis.
The contribution is accompanied by an Editorial by Kathryn Moore
and Coen van Solingen from the New York University School of
Medicine in New York, USA.19 They highlight that the identification
of the NFATc3-regulated nuclear miR-204-3p/CD36 and cytoplasmic
miR-204-5p/SR-A axes adds new layers to our understanding of the
regulation of foam cell formation and atherogenesis. The ability of
NFATc3 to coordinately inhibit the expression of two important
scavenger receptors for foam cell formation, and its down-regulation
in monocytes and plaque macrophages of patients with CVD, identify
NFATc3 as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of
atherosclerosis.
The issue is also complemented by two Discussion Forum contributions. In a commentary entitled 'The reduction in cardiovascular risk in REDUCE-IT is due to eicosapentaenoic acid in
icosapent ethyl',20 Philippe Gabriel Steg from the Universite de
Paris in France, and Deepak Bhatt from Harvard Medical School comment on the recent publication 'A possible explanation for the
contrasting results of REDUCE-IT vs. STRENGTH: cohort
study mimicking trial designs' by Takahito Doi from the
Copenhagen University in Denmark.9,20 Doi et al. respond in a separate comment.21
The editors hope that this issue of the European Heart Journal will
be of interest to its readers.
