Aims

To provide multi-national, multi-ethnic data on the clinical characteristics and prognosis of patients with microvascular angina (MVA).

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
The Coronary Vasomotor Disorders International Study Group proposed the diagnostic criteria for MVA. We proand results
spectively evaluated the clinical characteristics of patients according to these criteria and their prognosis. The primary endpoint was the composite of major cardiovascular events (MACE), verified by institutional investigators,
which included cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, and hospitalization due to
heart failure or unstable angina. During the period from 1 July 2015 to 31 December 2018, 686 patients with MVA
were registered from 14 institutes in 7 countries from 4 continents. Among them, 64% were female and the main
ethnic groups were Caucasians (61%) and Asians (29%). During follow-up of a median of 398 days (IQR 365-744),
78 MACE occurred (6.4% in men vs. 8.6% in women, P = 0.19). Multivariable Cox proportional hazard analysis

disclosed that hypertension and previous history of coronary artery disease (CAD), including acute coronary syndrome and stable angina pectoris, were independent predictors of MACE. There was no sex or ethnic difference in
prognosis, although women had lower Seattle Angina Questionnaire scores than men (P < 0.05).

Conclusions
This first international study provides novel evidence that MVA is an important health problem regardless of sex
or ethnicity that a diagnosis of MVA portends a substantial risk for MACE associated with hypertension and previous history of CAD, and that women have a lower quality of life than men despite the comparable prognosis.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                   

Graphical Abstract

Introduction
Angina pectoris has been considered to be mainly caused by atherosclerotic obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD).1 However, up
to 50% of patients undergoing diagnostic coronary angiography for
typical chest pain have angiographically normal coronary arteries or
non-obstructive CAD.2 In such cases, coronary functional abnormalities are implicated, including epicardial coronary artery spasm and
coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD).3 The latter is typically
defined as increased susceptibility to vasoconstrictor stimuli resulting
in microvascular spasm and/or impaired dilatation of coronary microvessels, with resultant inadequate increase in blood flow in response
to stress.4-6 Thus, CMD may be the underlying mechanism in a large
proportion of angina patients.
The term microvascular angina (MVA), originally proposed by
Cannon and Epstein in 1988,7 is used for angina/myocardial ischaemia
attributable to CMD. Recently, several studies with either invasive or
non-invasive techniques for assessment of coronary physiology have
provided extensive data, improving what is known about CMD and

microvascular ischaemia.8,9 In addition, as the COronary VAsomotor
Disorders International Study (COVADIS) Group, we have proposed the diagnostic criteria of MVA.10 Briefly, the diagnosis of MVA
is established based upon symptoms suggestive of myocardial ischaemia in the absence of obstructive CAD (<50% diameter reduction
and/or fractional flow reserve >0.80) associated with objective evidence of myocardial ischaemia and impaired coronary microvascular
function defined by the following four findings: reduced coronary
flow reserve (CFR), microvascular spasm, increased microvascular
resistance, and/or coronary 'slow flow phenomenon'.10
To date, clinical studies have mainly been the single centre. Given
the lack of evidence from international multi-centre studies, the clinical characteristics, and prognosis of patients with MVA remain to be
fully elucidated. Our first objective was to study the clinical characteristics and health outcomes of patients with MVA in a large, prospective, international registry. Our second objective was to assess for
associations by sex and ethnicity. Thus, in the present study, we
undertook a multinational, multi-centre, multi-ethnic, prospective,
observational, and longitudinal cohort study.

Non-invasive assessment of CMD was obtained by measuring CFR for
the whole left ventricle with PET, CMR, or by measuring Doppler flow
velocity reserve on the left anterior descending coronary artery. The
CFR cut-off was set at <2.5.4,6
Coronary microvascular dysfunction was assessed invasively by using
coronary functional testing, including measurements of CFR and/or
microvascular resistance and/or acetylcholine provocation testing for
coronary microvascular spasm.10 The CFR cut-off was defined at <2.0 for
invasive measurement.8-10,12 Abnormal microvascular resistance was
defined as more than 25 units of index of microcirculatory resistance.8-10
Coronary slow flow phenomenon was defined as TIMI frame count >25
at invasive coronary angiography.8-10 Coronary microvascular spasm was
defined as the reproduction of symptoms, ischaemic ECG changes, but
no epicardial coronary spasm during acetylcholine provocation testing.10
In the present study, definitive MVA was diagnosed if all four criteria were
present, while suspected MVA was diagnosed if symptoms of ischaemia
were present with no obstructive CAD but one of the following only:
objective evidence of myocardial ischaemia or evidence of CMD. Both
definitive and suspected MVA were included in the present study.
Seventy-five patients (11%) were diagnosed as having MVA by using noninvasive assessment alone, including exercise stress ECG (n = 34), SPECT
(n = 18), PET (n = 16), stress echocardiography (n = 4), and CMR (n = 3).
Study variables were obtained at enrolment, including patient demographic profiles, cardiovascular risk factors, past history of CAD including
acute coronary syndrome and stable angina pectoris, non-invasive diagnostic modalities for myocardial ischaemia, invasive assessment of microvascular function, initial treatment after diagnosis, and assessment of
quality of life (QOL) by the Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ)
(Supplementary material online, Methods).13
From 1 July 2015 to 31 December 2018, the participating centres prospectively enrolled 686 patients with MVA (Figure 1). All patients

Fourteen medical centres in seven countries from four continents participated in the present study. Data collection was performed via a standardized electronic case report system established by the Japanese
Coronary Spasm Association.11 We enrolled patients who fulfilling the
COVADIS diagnostic criteria for MVA as follows: (i) signs and/or symptoms of myocardial ischaemia, (ii) absence of obstructive CAD, (iii) objective evidence of myocardial ischaemia, and (iv) evidence of impaired
coronary microvascular function, as determined by the clinical site
(Figure 1, Supplementary material online, Table S1).10 Objective evidence
of myocardial ischaemia, impaired coronary microvascular function, and
ischaemic symptoms was determined by attending COVADIS site physicians using detailed criteria below. Clinical characteristics, cardiovascular
risk factors (including body mass index, history of hypertension, dyslipidaemia, diabetes mellitus, and current smoking), diagnostic approaches,
and the trend of medical therapies for contemporary MVA patients, particularly in terms of ethnic and sex differences were documented
(Supplementary material online, Methods).
Obstructive CAD was defined as any coronary stenosis of >50%
reduction in diameter by conventional angiography or computed
tomography angiography, and those patients with obstructive CAD
were excluded. Objective evidence of myocardial ischaemia was
evaluated using non-invasive stress testing. Evidence of myocardial
ischaemia was obtained by rest/stress ECG and/or by means of noninvasive imaging by assessing either myocardial perfusion with single
photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), positron emission
tomography (PET), cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), and left ventricular wall motion abnormality with stress echocardiography.10

Clinical characteristics and prognosis of patients with microvascular angina

Study endpoints
The primary endpoint was the composite of major cardiovascular events
(MACE), including cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction
(MI), non-fatal stroke, and hospitalization due to heart failure or unstable
angina determined by the institutional investigators at each COVADIS
site or an independent clinical event committee. Definition of MI was
based on the third universal definition,14 and that of unstable angina was
based on the presence of ischaemic chest pain and hospitalization within
24 h of most recent symptoms, without elevation in cardiac biomarkers
but with ischaemic ECG changes.15 Stroke was defined as neurological
deficit due to an ischaemic or haemorrhagic central nervous system event
with residual systems >24 h after onset or leading to death.16 For each
patient, a MACE was defined as the first occurrence of one of these
events during the follow-up period. The associations between baseline
characteristics, including sex and medical history, and MACE were
evaluated.

Statistical methods
Statistical methods appropriate for epidemiological studies were used for
the analysis of the collected data. Baseline continuous variables are presented as means +/- SD or medians and interquartile range, depending on
the distribution of the data that was tested by Shapiro-Wilk normality
test. Categorical variables are presented as counts and percentages. We
used the Wilcoxon rank-sum test to compare continuous variables and
the Pearson chi-square test to compare categorical variables. Events
were analysed as time from enrolment to the first occurrence of any
event from the composite endpoint. We used the Kaplan-Meier method
to provide survival estimates, which were assessed with a log-rank test.
To reduce confounding effects, propensity score methods were used
with potential confounding covariates, including age, sex, hypertension,
dyslipidaemia, diabetes mellitus, current smoking, previous history of
CAD, and previous percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
Additional supportive analyses included time to the first occurrence of
each component of the composite endpoint individually. Event rates of
the composite endpoint and of each endpoint are reported separately at
1, 2, and 3 years since enrolment. To examine the determinants of the
primary endpoint, we used a multivariable Cox proportional hazard
model. A statistical analysis plan was pre-specified before each interim
analysis. Multivariable analysis was conducted to analyse outcomes by
study variables.

Results
Baseline clinical characteristics
Patient enrolment and their follow-up are shown in Figure 1. From
July 2015 to December 2018, a total of 686 patients with MVA (M/F
248/438, 61.2 +/- 11.8 years) were finally enrolled, including 191 cases
in Japan, 171 in the UK, 109 in Germany, 88 in the USA, 59 in Italy, 51

..
.. in Spain, and 17 in Australia. Follow-up rate was 97% (18 lost among
.. 704 patients). Their pertinent clinical characteristics are summarized
..
.. in Table 1. Approximately two-thirds (64%) were female and the
.. main ethnic groups were Caucasians (61%), Asians (29%), and
..
.. Hispanics (6%). More than half of them had hypertension (52%) and/
.. or dyslipidaemia (52%), whereas relatively fewer patients had dia..
.. betes mellitus (17%) or were current smokers (16%). Although 233
.. patients (34%) had the previous history of CAD, including acute cor..
.. onary syndrome and stable angina pectoris, only 9% had undergone
.. PCI previously. Considering risk factors for coronary atherosclerosis,
..
.. current smoking, previous history of CAD, vasospastic angina, and
.. previous PCI were more prevalent among men, whereas the preva..
.. lence of other risk factors were comparable in both sexes (Table 1).
..
Predominant symptoms were chest pain or chest discomfort
..
.. (68%), especially at rest (36%), and shortness of breath on exertion
.. (18%). Ischaemic ECG changes during chest pain were documented
..
.. in 26%, where the most frequent finding was ST-segment depression
.. (24%). Of note, regarding SAQ scores, women had significantly lower
..
.. scores compared with men in all items, indicating lower QOL in
.. women (Table 1).
..
..
Of the 686 patients, 59% had objective evidence of myocardial is..
chaemia
during non-invasive stress testing, including exercise stress
..
.. ECG (34%), Doppler/stress echocardiography (13%), CMR (10%),
..
.. SPECT (6%), and PET (6%). Invasive assessments of coronary micro.. vascular function were performed in 611 patients (89%); these
..
.. showed that microvascular spasm was most frequent (42%), followed
.. by impaired CFR (35%), abnormal microvascular resistance (14%),
..
.. and slow flow abnormalities (6%) (Table 1). In the present study, 261
.. patients (38%) had comorbid epicardial coronary spasm evaluated by
..
.. acetylcholine provocation testing. For the initial treatment after the
.. diagnosis of MVA was made, patients received oral treatment with
..
.. statins (62%), nitrates (43%), calcium channel blockers (36%), and/or
.. beta-blockers (36%), as determined by attending physicians (Table 1).
..
..
.. Clinical outcomes and prognostic factors
..
.. At a median follow-up of 398 days (interquartile range 365-
.. 744 days), there were 78 MACE in the overall cohort, including hos..
.. pitalization for unstable angina (n = 63), cardiovascular death (n = 9),
.. non-fatal MI (n = 5), and hospitalization for acute heart failure (n = 1).
..
.. The annual incidence of the primary composite of MACE in the over.. all cohort was 7.7% per patient year (Figure 2A). Among these, the in..
.. cidence of hospitalization for unstable angina (5.9% per patient year)
..
.. was higher than that of the other adverse events, given that the rate
.. of cardiovascular death was 1.0% per patient year and the rate of
..
.. non-fatal MI was 0.5% per patient year (Figure 2B).
..
Importantly, there was no significant sex difference in the incidence
..
.. of MACE (male 6.4% vs. female 8.6% per patient year, P = 0.19)
.. (Figure 3A). Furthermore, the incidence of MACE was comparable
..
.. even after propensity score matching (Supplementary material on.. line, Figure S1). Considering MACE by ethnic group, the overall im..
.. pact of race or ethnicity was significant, where Caucasians had a
.. higher risk of MACE than Asians (9.3% vs. 4.5% per patient year,
..
.. P = 0.0002) (Figure 3B). However, after propensity score matching,
.. there was no significant difference in the incidence of MACE between
..
.. the two ethnicities (Supplementary material online, Figure S2).
..
Furthermore, multivariable Cox proportional hazard analysis
..
. showed that hypertension and previous history of CAD, including

underwent clinical assessments and received usual medical care as determined by attending physicians. They did not receive any investigational
treatments for MVA before study enrolment and during the follow-up
period. Follow-up of each patient was conducted at least once from study
entry to the end of December 2019 either by a telephone call or a site
visit, depending on the approach considered most practical and effective.
The ethics committee of Tohoku University Graduate School of
Medicine approved the study protocol (No. 2015-1-188) followed by the
ethics committee and/or sponsors at each participating institute, in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki (UMIN000035177). All patients
provided written informed consent for research before study entry.

there were no sex differences in prognosis despite lower QOL in
women. There were no differences in prognosis between ethnic
groups.

Diagnosis of microvascular angina
Coronary microvascular dysfunction can develop in variable clinical
settings and can be triggered by multiple pathogenetic mechanisms.5
Microvascular angina is attributable to varying degrees of disruption
of normal coronary physiology, which may subsequently impair the
capacity of myocardial blood flow to satisfy myocardial oxygen demand.4 In the present study, all patients were registered based on objective evidence of myocardial ischaemia and/or microvascular
dysfunction according to the established diagnostic criteria for MVA
by the COVADIS Group.10 Thus, employing the standardized criteria
for MVA allowed us to utilize different diagnostic strategies, including
non-invasive and invasive assessments in relation to their institutional
feasibility and safety.

Clinical characteristics of patients with
microvascular angina
Coronary microvascular dysfunction has been associated with cardiovascular risk factors, including age, hypertension, dyslipidaemia,
and diabetes mellitus,17 although the prevalence of these conditions
in patients with the MVA syndrome remains unknown. Moreover,
CMD is also associated with clinical syndromes caused by cardiovascular disease, including left ventricular hypertrophy and heart failure
with preserved ejection fraction.17 In the present study, more than
half of the patients with MVA had hypertension (52%) and/or dyslipidaemia (52%), whereas relatively fewer patients had diabetes mellitus
(17%) or were current smokers (16%). The prevalence of traditional
coronary risk factors in our patients with MVA is consistent with a
previous report that targeted patients with myocardial ischaemia and
non-obstructive CAD.18

Prognosis of patients with microvascular
angina
Previously, the prognosis of patients with MVA has been suggested
to be good;19 however, the sample size was small, and a considerable
proportion of patients lacked markers of potential worse outcome.20
In the present study, the incidence of the primary composite of
MACE in the overall cohort (7.7% per patient year) was comparable
to that reported by Pepine et al.20 Although the prevalence of atherosclerotic risk factors was comparable with that of the previous

.. studies of non-obstructive CAD, the incidence of subsequent acute
..
.. MI in the present study was lower than that reported before.19,20
..
..
.. Sex and ethnic differences in
..
.. microvascular angina
.. In previous studies, women, as compared with men, were more likely
..
.. to have angina without significant coronary artery stenosis but had a
.. comparable risk of cardiovascular events.18,20 Of note, in the present
..
.. study, there was no significant sex-related difference in the incidence
..
.. of cardiovascular events even after propensity score matching with
.. potential confounding factors. Additionally, as demonstrated in
..
.. Table 1, women had significantly lower SAQ scores than men, indicat.. ing worse QOL in the former. To date, a few studies addressed
..
.. sex-related differences in QOL in patients with chronic coronary
.. syndromes, but they did not address the underlying mechanisms of is..
.. chaemia.21 Recently, the CorMicA randomized controlled trial of
..
.. stratified medicine reported improvements in anginal symptoms and
.. QOL in patients with CMD in general, but not specifically sex-related
..
.. differences.8 Female hormones are involved in sex differences in the
.. perception of chest symptoms in patients with MVA.18 Furthermore,
..
.. while no previous study has addressed ethnic differences in patients
.. with MVA, in the present study, the incidence of adverse cardiovascu..
.. lar events was significantly higher in Caucasians than in Asians
.. (Figure 3B), in part relating to differences in the burden of vascular
..
.. risk factors since, after propensity score matching, the incidence of
..
.. MACE was not different between the two ethnic groups (Supple.. mentary material online, Table S2, Figure S2).
..
..
.. Treatment of microvascular angina
..
.. The management of MVA represents a major unmet need because

Clinical characteristics and prognosis of patients with microvascular angina

Study limitations
Although our study has multiple strengths (the first international
study on MVA with multiple ethnicities and countries, large sample
size, use of consensus diagnostic criteria for MVA, and high follow-up
rate, etc.), several limitations should be mentioned. First, the present
study was an observational study without a reference group. Second,
the relatively small number of MACE during follow-up limits the statistical power of the present study and might have led to data overfitting. Third, the majority of MACE (90%) were hospitalization for
unstable angina. However, the prevalence of hospitalization for unstable angina to total MACE was comparable with previous
reports.9,27 Fourth, we excluded patients with obstructive CAD by
conventional angiography or coronary computed tomography and
have no data regarding functional relevance of coronary artery stenoses evaluated by physiological indices. Finally, we have no data
regarding changes in or adherence to medical therapy, or symptoms
and/or QOL (e.g. SAQ) during follow-up. These issues remain to be
examined in future studies.

Conclusions
This first international study provides evidence on the prognostic impact of MVA and novel insights into sex and ethnicity. Female patients
have lower QOL than male patients despite the comparable prognosis. Vascular risk factors are prevalent and a target for therapy.
Further studies are needed to address knowledge gaps including risk
stratification and effective treatments of patients with MVA.

NCT04674449) of stratified medicine in angina. Furthermore, the
treatment of MVA has been empirical because its pathophysiology
appears to be multifactorial with overlapping phenotypes that often
coexist. Recent reports discussed the management of MVA patients
and suggested some potential treatment strategies.18,22 Anti-atherothrombotic treatments with statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitors (ACE-I) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), and lowdose aspirin may improve symptoms and outcomes of MVA
patients.23,24 Patients enrolled in the present study received oral
treatment with statins (62%), nitrates (43%), ACE-I (25%), and ARB
(17%) as determined by attending physicians after the diagnosis of
MVA was made. Furthermore, conventional anti-anginal therapies,
including beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and nitrates, are
reasonable first-line regimens for MVA patients given the underlying
pathophysiology.25,26 Regarding vasodilators, there was a sex difference in the present study as women received more frequently
nitrates, whereas men received more frequently calcium channel
blockers. More frequent use of nitrates in women might represent
more frequent anginal attacks than in men, which is consistent with
our observations of significantly lower SAQ scores in physical limitation and angina stability among women.
