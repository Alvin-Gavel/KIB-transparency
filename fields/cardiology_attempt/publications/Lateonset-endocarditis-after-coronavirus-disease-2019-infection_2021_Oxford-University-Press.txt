An 18-year-old man with acute dyspnoea
presented to our hospital 3 months after
hospitalization due to coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19) infection confirmed by
reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2. On
admission, he had no fever and took no
medication. Electrocardiography showed an
early repolarization pattern in the precordial
leads and ST-segment depression in lead III
(Panel A). Transthoracic echocardiography
showed subtle wall motion abnormality in
the left ventricular anterior wall
(Supplementary material online, Video S1).
His cardiac troponin T levels were elevated
at 642 ng/L, prompting urgent coronary
computed tomography (CT) angiography,
revealed no coronary artery stenosis in all
coronary arteries without any manifestation
of pneumonia or pulmonary embolism. Ten
minutes after contrast injection, CT showed
midwall delayed enhancement in the left
ventricular anterior wall (Panel B), indicating
COVID-19-related myocardial injury, which
were consistent with subsequent b-methylp-[123I]-iodophenyl-pentadecanoic
acid
(BMIPP) imaging (Panel C, Supplementary
material online, Video S2). The RT-PCR for
SARS-CoV-2 on admission returned positive, while serological tests for other virus infections were negative. Right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy revealed the thickened endocardium with fibrin and myeloperoxidase-positive neutrophils (Panels D-F) and the moderate interstitial fibrosis without inflammatory cell infiltration in the myocardium (Panels G-I), indicating endocarditis complicating myocardial fibrosis.
No vegetation or thrombus formation was detected by repeat echocardiography. Serum C-reactive protein levels were negative throughout the course. He was discharged without any complications on Day 3 and had no symptoms on Day 21.
In this case, non-bacterial inflammatory processes by SARS-CoV-2 may cause endocarditis. Our findings underscore the importance of
histological work-up to elucidate the mechanisms underlying COVID-19-related myocardial injury.
