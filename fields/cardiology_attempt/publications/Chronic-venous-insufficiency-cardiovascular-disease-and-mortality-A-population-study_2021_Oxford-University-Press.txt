Aims

Evidence regarding the health burden of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), its clinical determinants, and impact on
outcome is scarce.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
Systematic phenotyping of CVI according to established CEAP (Clinical-Etiologic-Anatomic-Pathophysiologic) classiand results
fication was performed in 12 423 participants (age range: 40-80 years) of the Gutenberg Health Study from April
2012 to April 2017. Prevalence was calculated age- and sex-specifically. Multivariable Poisson regression models
were calculated to evaluate the relation of CVI with cardiovascular comorbidities. Survival analyses were carried
out to assess the CVI-associated risk of death. Replication of findings was done in an independent cohort study
(MyoVasc, NCT04064450). The prevalence of telangiectasia/reticular, varicose veins, and CVI was 36.5% [95% confidence interval (CI), 35.6-37.4%], 13.3% [12.6-13.9%], and 40.8% [39.9-41.7%], respectively. Age, female sex, arterial hypertension, obesity, smoking, and clinically overt cardiovascular disease were identified as clinical determinants of CVI. Higher CEAP classes were associated with a higher predicted 10-year risk for incident cardiovascular
disease in individuals free of cardiovascular disease (n = 9923). During a mean follow-up of 6.4 +/- 1.6 years, CVI was
a strong predictor of all-cause death independent of the concomitant clinical profile and medication [hazard ratio
(HR) 1.46 (95% CI 1.19-1.79), P = 0. 0003]. The association of CVI with an increased risk of all-cause death was externally validated in the MyoVasc cohort [HR 1.51 (95% CI 1.11-2.05), P = 0.009].

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
Chronic venous insufficiency is highly prevalent in the population and is associated with the presence of cardiovascular risk factors and disease. Individuals with CVI experience an elevated risk of death, which is independent of
age and sex, and present cardiovascular risk factors and comorbidities.

Introduction
Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) refers to a spectrum of entities,
which are related to both structural and functional pathologies of the
venous system.1 The pathophysiology of CVI displays a complex interplay of venous valve dysfunction and venous hypertension with subsequent macro- and microcirculatory haemodynamic and vascular
alterations.2 Telangiectasia, reticular venectasia, varicose veins, and CVI
ranging from oedema to active skin ulcers represent the most common
clinically visible manifestations of chronic venous disease.3
Venous insufficiency is highly prevalent in developed and industrialized countries,4 but estimates for the prevalence vary widely between study setting, geographic region, and methodology.5 Recent
studies support the hypothesis that the pathophysiology of venous
and arterial vascular disease share commonalities and are interrelated.6,7 However, there is a paucity of investigations exploring the
interplay between venous and arterial cardiovascular disease8
and population-based studies exploring the relation of both vascular
disease manifestations and the subsequent risk of death across the
spectrum of venous insufficiency are currently not available.
The objectives of this study were (i) to provide current age- and
sex-specific prevalence estimates for the clinical range of CVI in the
population, (ii) to investigate the burden of cardiovascular risk factors
and comorbidities in the spectrum of venous disease, and (iii) to

Chronic venous insufficiency, cardiovascular disease, and mortality

Categorization of venous insufficiency
The presence of CVI was assessed according to the clinical presentation
of the CEAP (Clinical-Etiologic-Anatomic-Pathophysiologic) classification
scheme, which is most commonly used for standardized reporting in clinical and epidemiological studies.11 In brief, individuals were classified as
follows: C0-no visible signs of venous insufficiency, C1-telangiectasia
(C1a) or reticular veins (C1b), C2-varicose veins, C3-oedema, C4-
skin changes (C4a: pigmentation/eczema-C4b: lipodermatosclerosis/
white atrophy), C5-healed venous ulcer, and C6-active venous ulcer
(Supplementary material online, Figure S1). On an individual level, each
participant was classified to the highest C class of both legs. Chronic venous insufficiency was defined by CEAP clinical stage >_3, whereas individuals of C0 were categorized as being free of venous disease. The sample of
individuals with CVI was stratified by the severity of disease according to
C status into moderate (i.e. C3) and advanced CVI (i.e. C4-C6) and by
the presence of venous symptoms.

Validation cohort
The MyoVasc Study (NCT04064450)-a large prospective cohort on
heart failure based in Mainz, Germany-was used as an external validation cohort for investigating the relationship of CVI with all-cause mortality. Information on the rationale and design of the cohort including
information on all study procedures has been reported in detail.12 In the
MyoVasc cohort, assessment of CVI according to the clinical presentation
of the CEAP classification scheme was carried out identically to the GHS
cohort.

Statistical analysis
Discrete variables were described by relative and absolute frequencies,
continuous variables by means with standard deviation or median value
with 25th-75th percentiles (interquartile range, IQR), where appropriate.
Prevalence for C classes and symptoms of CVI were calculated sexspecifically with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and subsequently
weighted for the age- and sex-specific distributions of the German population on 31 December 2014 and for the European Standard Population
for translation of estimates to other populations. Cardiovascular disease
was defined as a composite of atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure,
coronary and peripheral artery disease, stroke, or venous thrombo-embolism. In order to evaluate the relation between CEAP clinical categories
and cardiovascular comorbidities, Poisson regression models with robust
variance estimator and adjustment for potential confounders were used.
This approach was chosen instead of less stable binomial regression models to overcome convergence problems. Prevalence ratios (PR) for categories of CVI as binary variable with individuals without signs of the
disease as reference group were calculated. The risk for incident

cardiovascular disease according to the clinical severity of CVI was evaluated using the Framingham 10-year risk score for cardiovascular
disease.13
Kaplan-Meier estimates were calculated to analyse survival according
to the presence of CVI and the log-rank test was applied to compare survival distributions. Cox proportional hazards models were applied to
evaluate whether CVI is an independent predictor of all-cause death. Due
to the explorative nature of the study, a significance threshold was not
defined and P-values were interpreted as continuous measure of statistical evidence. However, 95% CI are provided to guide interpretation of
effects and relative differences in data. All statistical analyses were conducted in R, version 3.5.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing,
Vienna, Austria).

Results
Clinical characteristics of the population
sample
Information on the clinical status of CVI was available for 10 664 individuals (Supplementary material online, Table S1). In the analysis sample, 48.8% of study participants were female and the mean age of the
study sample was 59.5 +/- 10.8 years. No signs of a venous insufficiency
(C0) were detected in 906, whereas telangiectasia or reticular venectasies (C1) were identified in 3756, varicose veins (C2) in 1399, and
clinically overt CVI (C3-C6) in 4603 individuals, of which 3361
presented with venous oedema (C3) and 1242 had skin changes
(C4-C6). The clinical characteristics of the study sample according to
the clinical conditions of the CEAP classification are displayed in Table
1. In brief, individuals with CVI were older and more likely to be female compared with individuals of CEAP class C0. The highest burden of traditional cardiovascular risk factors (i.e. arterial
hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidaemia, family history of myocardial infarction and/or stroke, obesity, and smoking) was detected
for individuals with CVI, which was highest in individuals with skin
changes (C4-C6) followed by individuals with venous oedema (C3).
This finding was accompanied by a higher co-prevalence of cardiovascular disease. Except for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, all
cardiovascular comorbidities showed the highest prevalence in
advanced CVI (C4-C6). In contrast, comparison of clinical characteristics between individuals with varicose veins and telangiectasia or reticular veins to individuals without venous insufficiency (C0) indicated
only minor distinctions.

Prevalence of chronic venous
insufficiency in the general population
In the total sample, the prevalence of chronic venous diseases was
36.5% (95% CI 35.6-37.4%) for telangiectasia and reticular venectasies (C1), 13.3% (95% CI 12.6-13.9%) for varicose veins (C2), and
40.8% (95% CI 39.9-41.7%) for CVI (C3-C6). Among all venous
disease phenotypes, venous insufficiency with oedema (C3) showed
the highest prevalence (30.1%, 95% CI 29.2-31.0%), followed by
venous insufficiency with non-acute skin changes (C4, 10.5%, 95% CI
9.9-11.1%) and venous insufficiency with ulceration (C5/C6, 0.2%,
95% CI 0.1-0.3%). Age- and sex-specific estimates for the burden of
venous insufficiency in the general population are displayed in detail
in Figure 1 and in Supplementary material online, Table S2. Sensitivity

comorbidities via a computer-assisted personal interview, review of medical records, clinical examinations, and laboratory analysis of venous
blood samples. Clinical examination included the pitting oedema test for
the distinction of non-pitting and pitting oedema.10 The clinical condition
of the lower limbs was recorded in a standardized fashion with digital
photographs of the legs in standing position from pre-defined angles
(front and back). Subsequent grading of the data was carried out via image
reading by five independent investigators. Quality control of image reading was performed including the evaluation of inter- and intra-observer
variabilities (Cohen's Kappa = 0.76 and 0.80, respectively). Information
on symptoms related to venous disease (e.g. oedema, phlebitis, and leg
pain) was assessed during a computer-assisted personal interview and in
a standardized clinical examination. Information on all-cause mortality
was obtained for all individuals via state registration offices.

analysis excluding individuals with competing risk for oedema indicated only slightly attenuated estimates for the prevalence of venous
oedema and underlined the robustness of prevalence estimates
(Supplementary material online, Table S3). Prevalence estimates
weighted for standard populations for the comparison to other populations are provided in the Supplementary material online, Appendix
(Table S4 and S5). The frequency of self-reported symptoms associated with CVI was higher in women than in men in almost all categories of symptoms and CEAP classes. Leg pain was the most frequently
reported symptom in CEAP classes C0-C2. For CVI, the highest
prevalence of symptoms was found for leg swelling followed by leg
pain (Supplementary material online, Tables S6 and S7).

Cardiovascular comorbidities and
Clinical-Etiologic-AnatomicPathophysiologic clinical conditions
To analyse the relationship between different stages of venous insufficiency, cardiovascular risk factors, and comorbidities, regression analysis was performed. In univariate analysis, age, female sex, and all
traditional cardiovascular risk factors and cardiovascular comorbidities were associated with the prevalence of CVI (Supplementary material online, Tables S8 and S9). In multivariable analysis
(Supplementary material online, Figure S2), age and female sex were

detected as independent predictors of all stages of the continuum of
venous diseases. Chronic venous insufficiency was independently
associated with an increased prevalence of arterial hypertension (PR
1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.07; P = 0.004), obesity (PR 1.16, 95% CI 1.14-
1.19; P < 0.001), and active smoking (PR 1.09, 95% CI 1.04-1.15;
P = 0.001) as well as cardiovascular disease (PR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-
1.05; P = 0.01). With regard to cardiovascular disease, advanced CVI
(C4-C6) was specifically associated with peripheral artery disease
(PR 1.13, 95% CI 1.04-1.24; P = 0.006) and venous thrombo-embolism (PR 1.18, 95% CI 1.09-1.29; P < 0.001). In contrast, moderate
venous insufficiency (C3) did not show a significant association with
specific cardiovascular disease phenotypes. Overall, a higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease was observed in advanced CVI (PR
1.10, 95% CI 1.03-1.17; P = 0.003) than for moderate CVI (PR 1.03,
95% CI 1.01-1.05; P = 0.01) in comparison to individuals without CVI
(Supplementary material online, Table S10).
Given the high burden of cardiovascular risk factors and cardiovascular disease in individuals with CVI, the role of venous disease for
the prediction of cardiovascular disease was further investigated
(Table 2). In multivariable regression models with adjustment for age,
sex, and traditional cardiovascular risk factors, CVI was independently associated with the presence of clinically overt cardiovascular disease (PR 1.46, 95% CI 1.16-1.84; P < 0.001). This relation increased
proportionally along with higher CEAP stages and was most

pronounced for individuals with symptomatic CVI (PR 2.28, 95% CI

along with increasing severity of CVI (Figure 2A).

Cox proportional hazard models with adjustment for potential confounders (i.e. age and sex) and potential effect mediators (i.e. traditional cardiovascular risk factors, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and symptomatic disease) were
analysed. The cardiovascular medication comprises antithrombotic agents (ATC code B01), cardiac therapy (C01), antihypertensive drugs (C02), diuretics (C03), beta-blockers
(C07), calcium channel blockers (C08), agents interacting with the renin-angiotensin system (i.e. angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin I receptor blockers;

Discussion
The present study represents the largest population-based investigation of the full spectrum of CVI to date. The major findings of this
study are that (i) CVI has a high prevalence in the population, (ii) cardiovascular disease and CVI are interdependent and share risk factors, and (iii) CVI represents a strong predictor for all-cause
mortality in the general population beyond established risk factors
(Graphical abstract). The association with all-cause death was externally replicated in an independent cohort.
The results of the present study provide the latest populationbased, sex-specific prevalence estimates in a developed country of
predominantly white ancestry. The current study underlines the high
burden of chronic venous disorders in the population assessed by
CEAP clinical categories: the prevalence of varicose veins (C2) was
13.3% and of clinically overt CVI (C3-C6) 40.8% making venous disease by far the most prevalent vascular disease in the population. In
line with previous reports, only 9.4% of the population (age range:
40-80 years) showed no clinical signs of venous disease in the present study.14 In the literature, estimates for the prevalence of venous
insufficiency vary widely and range from <1% to 73% by study setting,
methodology, and study population.5,15,16 In contrast to the more
frequent presentations of CVI, i.e. oedema (C3) or skin changes without ulceration (C4), the prevalence of venous ulcers (C5/C6) was
very low in the present study and confirms reports of smaller sample
size.17 To avoid bias, a highly standardized data assessment with rigorous data control was applied and sensitivity analysis performed to exclude misclassification. These results are of particular interest when
considering that the magnitude and impact of venous insufficiency are
prone to an under-appreciation.

Although the present study does not establish a causative role of
CVI for the development of atherosclerosis and arterial cardiovascular disease, it suggests the existence of a link between arterial and
venous vascular disease, which might be partly explained by shared
risk factors. Very recently, a retrospective Taiwanese study using
claims data reported that the presence of varicose veins was associated with an increased incidence of venous thrombo-embolism and
peripheral artery disease.6 These observations are complemented by
data from the Framingham Heart Study demonstrating that individuals with varicose veins experience a higher incidence of future atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease than those without varicose
veins, especially for coronary heart disease.18 Since CVI was related
with cardiovascular disease independent of traditional cardiovascular
risk factors and comorbidities in the present study, the findings suggest a potential cross-talk between arterial and venous vascular beds.
This adds to already existing integrative approaches to vascular disease by highlighting the importance of 'venous disease' as vascular disease in terms of cardiovascular disease, which is till now most
commonly thought to be related to arterial vascular disease only.19
Since systemic inflammation is commonly accepted to play a pivotal
role in the development and progression of both arterial and venous
vascular disease,2,20 it is conceivable that structural and functional
inflammation-mediated alterations in the endothelium in both vascular beds might be the consequence of the exposure to traditional cardiovascular risk factors. This may also lead to a systemic cross-talk via
overarching shared mechanisms such as autonomic imbalance.19,21
In the present study, age and female sex were confirmed as risk
factors of CVI, which have been reported earlier by others,5 but
interestingly also for earlier disease stages. The current pathophysiological understanding is that venous vessels experience vascular ageing due to venous hypertension, which subsequently leads to gradual
deterioration of the vessel wall and valve competence over time.5
With regard to female sex, studies indicate that physiological changes
during pregnancy (e.g. increase in blood volume and body composition) and direct effects of sex-steroid hormones are relevant for the

pathophysiology.22 Hypercoagulability associated with pregnancy23
and the use of oral contraceptives24 provide further explanations for
the increased risk of CVI in women. Considering the high prevalence
of venous insufficiency in the population, it is noteworthy that cardiovascular risk factors and comorbidities were highly prevalent in individuals with CVI. The results substantiated the notion that
cardiovascular comorbidities show a distinct profile throughout the
continuum of venous insufficiency.25 Age, female sex, diabetes mellitus, obesity, arterial hypertension, smoking, and cardiovascular disease were detected as independent predictors of CVI, whereas only
age and female sex were associated with a higher risk for the presence of varicose veins, telangiectasia, or reticular veins. This adds to
the limited literature available by suggesting that smoking and in particular obesity, which is known to contribute to venous stasis and systemic inflammation, are in fact risk factors for the development of
CVI.26 This is of specific importance given the high public health impact of both conditions.27 For arterial hypertension and cardiovascular disease, only a few studies have so far reported an independent

..
.. relation to CVI.7 Against the limited body of evidence available, the
.. present study supports an interdependence of venous and arterial
..
.. hypertension. Peripheral vascular remodelling and systemic inflamma.. tion with subsequent hypercoagulability represent commonalities,
..
.. which may explain the relevance of hypertension for the disease
.. pathology in both vascular beds.28
..
..
..
.. Strengths and limitations
.. The major strengths of the present study represent the population..
.. based setting and comprehensive phenotyping of individuals by
.. specially trained staff in a dedicated study centre. All data including
..
.. clinical outcomes were recorded in a highly reproducible and stand.. ardized manner. Nevertheless, some limitations merit consideration:
..
.. CEAP grading of venous insufficiency was limited to the clinical status
.. as documented by standardized photographic documentation and
..
.. subsequently analysed by trained staff. Although a large panel of cova.. riates was considered in regression analyses, unmeasured confound..
.. ing (e.g. introduced by limited physical activity or nutrition) cannot be
.. ruled out completely. However, verification of the relationship be..
.. tween CVI and all-cause death in the subsample of individuals free of
.. prevalent cardiovascular disease as well as the external replication of
..
.. study findings in an independent cohort support the validity and ro.. bustness of the data. Further investigations in other settings will help
..
.. to explore the generalizability of results (e.g. by analysis of different
.. population cohorts and specific diseased cohorts). Future research
..
.. should evaluate the pathophysiology linking the relationship of CVI
..
.. with arterial cardiovascular disease.
..
..
..
.. Conclusions
..
..
.. The present study demonstrates that CVI is related to cardiovascular
.. disease and is predictive of all-cause death. The data call for an
..
.. increased awareness of the prevalence and clinical implications of the
.. disease beyond cosmetic issues. This work opens up important new
..
.. tasks for future research, including experimental studies, investiga..
.. tions related to subclinical disease pathology, and possibly interven.. tions. Environmental factors (e.g. occupation), diet, imaging
..
.. modalities, and genetic variance29 will play a role in this context.
.. Assessment of the clinical signs of CVI may also represent an interest..
.. ing approach to improve risk stratification through early detection of
.. cardiovascular disease and associated risk factors in individuals with
..
.. this condition.
