Aims

We aimed to describe the risk of myocardial infarction (MI) in middle-aged and older patients with congenital heart
disease (ACHD) and to evaluate the long-term outcomes after index MI in patients with ACHD compared with
controls.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
A search of the Swedish National Patient Register identified 17 189 patients with ACHD (52.2% male) and
and results
180 131 age- and sex-matched controls randomly selected from the general population who were born from 1930
to 1970 and were alive at 40 years of age; all followed up until December 2017 (mean follow-up 23.2 +/- 11.0 years).
Patients with ACHD had a 1.6-fold higher risk of MI compared with controls [hazard ratio (HR) 1.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.5-1.7, P < 0.001] and the cumulative incidence of MI by 65 years of age was 7.4% in patients
with ACHD vs. 4.4% in controls. Patients with ACHD had a 1.4-fold increased risk of experiencing a composite
event after the index MI compared with controls (HR 1.4, 95% CI 1.3-1.6, P < 0.001), driven largely by the occurrence of new-onset heart failure in 42.2% (n = 537) of patients with ACHD vs. 29.5% (n = 2526) of controls.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
Patients with ACHD had an increased risk of developing MI and of recurrent MI, new-onset heart failure, or death
after the index MI, compared with controls, mainly because of a higher incidence of newly diagnosed heart failure
in patients with ACHD. Recognizing and managing the modifiable cardiovascular risk factors should be of importance to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with ACHD.

Introduction

Methods
Data sources
The present study used data from the Swedish National Patient Register
(NPR) and Cause of Death Register. The NPR was initiated in 1964, with
full coverage since 1987, and reporting to the register is mandatory for all
hospitals. Since 2001, the NPR has also recorded all diagnoses from hospital outpatient clinics. Primary and secondary diagnoses in the NPR are
coded in accordance with the International Classification of Disease
(ICD) system. The Cause of Death Register contains information on all
deaths of Swedish citizens from 1961 onwards.

Study population
The NPR was searched to identify all patients with at least one ACHD
diagnosis who were born from 1930-1970 and were alive at the age of
40 years. Patients who were alive at >_40 years of age and were diagnosed
with an ACHD for the first time in the Cause of Death Register were also
included. Each patient with ACHD was sex- and age-matched with 10
controls from the Total Population Register who did not have an ACHD
diagnosis. All personal identifiers were replaced by anonymized codes in
the final dataset. Patients and controls were followed from January 1970
to December 2017. For administrative reasons, cause of death information was unavailable for 2017.

..
The index MI population comprised all patients with ACHD and con..
.. trols with a first diagnosis of MI at >_40 years of age. Patients who were
.. diagnosed with MI before the age of 40 years were excluded (59 patients
..
.. with ACHD, 162 controls), as were patients with a ventricular septal de.. fect (VSD) diagnosed for the first time on the same date or within
..
.. 3 months of the MI diagnosis (n = 96), as these patients were considered
.. more likely to have post-MI VSD.
..
Within the index MI population, patients with recurrent MI, new-onset
..
.. heart failure, or CVD death were then identified. Patients with ACHD
.. and controls were compared regarding: (i) incidence of index MI and (ii)
..
.. risk of a composite event after index MI (either a recurrent MI, or new.. onset heart failure, or CVD death, whichever happened first).
..
..
.. Definitions
..
.. Supplementary material online, Table S1 lists the ACHD diagnoses in the
.. ICD versions 8, 9, and 10. The ACHD diagnoses were grouped into six
.. lesion groups according to a hierarchical classification system based on le..

.. The lesion groups, corresponding diagnoses, and ICD codes are shown in
..
.. Supplementary material online, Table S2. The ICD codes for the out.. comes and cardiovascular risk factors, as well as definitions of cardiovas..
.. cular risk factors and procedures, are shown in Supplementary material
.. online, Table S3.
..
Recurrent MI was defined as a second hospitalization or death due to
..
.. MI in the NPR or Cause of Death Register occurring >_2 months after
.. index MI. New-onset heart failure was defined as a heart failure diagnosis
..
.. that was identified for the first time during the same admission as the
.. index MI or any time after the index MI (either hospitalization or out.. patient clinic visit or fatal heart failure).

..
.. divided by the total follow-up time of patients and controls. The statistical
.. analyses were performed using R version 3.5.2 (R Foundation for

Congenital heart disease is the most common major birth defect,
with an incidence of approximately 1% in newborns.1 Because of
advances in surgical and medical management of patients with congenital heart disease in recent decades, a growing proportion of children with congenital heart disease survive into adulthood,2,3 thus
increasing the population of adults with congenital heart disease
(ACHD).4-6 These older patients will be prone to develop atherosclerotic disease and other age-related disorders such as coronary artery disease (CAD), heart failure, and ischaemic stroke.7-11
Patients with ACHD have been reported to have an increased risk
of CAD and myocardial infarction (MI) compared with controls7,10,12
and it is unclear whether patients with ACHD are at increased risk of
adverse outcomes such as recurrent MI, heart failure, or death compared with other patients with CAD. This represents an important
knowledge gap considering that CAD is one of the main predictors
of mortality in the constantly growing group of older patients with
ACHD.6
CAD is the most common cause of heart failure in patients without ACHD.13 In contrast, heart failure in patients with ACHD is
mostly attributed to complications related to structural abnormalities.9 Given the increased risk of MI in patients with ACHD, knowledge about the long-term outcomes after MI in patients with ACHD
is important for secondary prevention measures and healthcare planning in this patient group.
Therefore, the present study aimed to: (i) describe the risk of
index MI in middle-aged and older patients with ACHD compared
with controls and (ii) evaluate the long-term outcomes after index MI
[risk of a composite event of either a recurrent MI, new-onset heart
failure, or cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality] in patients with
ACHD compared with controls.

survival analysis was performed to calculate the cumulative incidence of a
composite event (either a recurrent MI, or new-onset heart failure, or
CVD death, whichever happened first) in patients with ACHD and
controls.
Cox proportional hazard regression models were performed to obtain the HRs and 95% CIs for the composite event after the index MI in
patients with ACHD and controls. Data are presented as Model 1 (unadjusted) and Model 2 (adjusted for diabetes mellitus, hypertension,
hypercholesterolaemia, and age at MI). The assumption of proportionality
was tested and met the requirement of proportionality.
In the index MI population (for ACHD and controls), we also calculated the total number of recurrent events by adding the number of
patients with one, two, three, or four episodes of recurrent MIs and heart
failure-related hospitalizations and outpatients visits (including fatal MIs
and heart failure), divided by total number of patients with index MI and
multiplied by 100. The time frame was from index MI until the end of
follow-up (2017).

Ethical approval
The study was approved by the regional ethics board in Gothenburg
(Gbg 912-16, T 616-18) and complied with the Declaration of Helsinki.
As retrospective and coded registry data were used, the need for patient
consent was waived.

Results
Study population
The study cohort comprised 17 189 patients with ACHD (52.2%
male) and 180 131 controls (52.3% male) (see Supplementary material online, Table S4). The mean follow-up duration was
23.2 +/- 11.0 years in patients with ACHD and 23.4 +/- 11.0 years in controls, comprising 387 368 person-years in the ACHD population and
4 147 183 person-years in controls.

.. Index myocardial infarction
.. Patients with ACHD had a 1.6-fold higher risk of MI compared with con..

Patients with ACHD were slightly younger than controls at the time
.. of index MI (Table 1). Only 48 patients with ACHD (3.2%) and 110 con..
.. trols (1.1%) with index MI were identified in the outpatient register
..
.. (Table 1). The risk of MI in patients with ACHD compared with controls

Discussion
The present study revealed that in comparison with controls, ACHD
was associated with a higher risk of MI and a higher long-term risk of
a composite event of either a recurrent MI, new-onset heart failure,
or CVD death. The increased risk of any of these events in patients
with ACHD was mainly explained by an increased risk of new-onset
heart failure in patients with ACHD vs. controls.
Patients with ACHD have an increased risk of heart failure compared with controls,16,17 related to complexity of lesion.9 Our results
indicate that patients with ACHD are also more prone to developing
heart failure related to MI, possibly due to structural ACHD-related
factors that predispose to heart failure, such as valvular disease and
systemic right ventricles, univentricular circulation, injury of coronary
arteries during surgical repair, or coronary anomalies. While MI in
patients with ACHD may unmask previously undiagnosed heart failure, heart failure might also be over-diagnosed in patients with
ACHD during admission for an MI (e.g. in patients with systemic right
ventricles and univentricular circulation systems), as these patients
habitually show a decreased ejection fraction.
The present study is the first to compare long-term outcomes
after MI in patients with and without ACHD. Notably, there was no
markedly increased risk of recurrent MI or all-cause death after
index MI in patients with ACHD compared with controls. It is

and 24.0% and 41.4% in controls, respectively. This was largely driven
by 42.2% (n = 537) of patients with ACHD experiencing new-onset
heart failure vs. 29.5% (n = 2526) of controls (P < 0.001), while recurrent MI was slightly more common among controls [9.6% (n = 820)]
than patients with ACHD [8.5% (n = 108)] (P = 0.241). Figure 2 shows
a Kaplan-Meier curve of freedom from composite event after index
MI in patients with ACHD and controls.
Patients with ACHD had a 1.4-fold higher risk of a composite
event compared with controls (HR 1.4, CI 1.3-1.6, P < 0.001), and
the increased risk in patients with ACHD persisted after adjustment
for age at index MI, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hypercholesterolaemia (HR 1.5, CI 1.4-1.6, P < 0.001). Patients with conotruncal
defects and coarctation of the aorta had the highest risk of a composite event relative to controls (Table 3).
ACHD was associated with a higher incidence of total events after
index MI (total number of recurrent non-fatal/fatal MIs, heart failurerelated hospitalizations, outpatient visits, and fatal heart failure in
patients with new-onset heart failure) compared with controls (84.6
events/100 patients with ACHD vs. 59.2 events/100 controls; Figure 3,
P < 0.001). ACHD was also associated with markedly more hospitalizations, outpatient visits for heart failure, and fatal heart failure events
compared with controls (75.3/100 patients vs. 48.8/100 controls),
while the incidence of recurrent MI was similar in both groups.
All-cause mortality after index MI was also slightly higher in
patients with ACHD vs. controls (Supplementary material online,
Figure S1); the cumulative incidence of all-cause mortality up to
38 years of follow-up after index MI was 90.8% in patients with
ACHD and 89.4% in controls.

Myocardial infarction in patients with congenital heart disease

Strengths and limitations
The present study had several strengths. First, the nationwide coverage enabled the study of all patients with ACHD throughout Sweden
born from 1930 to 1970, with a mean follow-up duration of
23 years and minimal loss to follow-up by linkage between the NPR
and the Cause of Death register. Our study is also the first to report
long-term outcomes after MI in patients with ACHD, including risk of
recurrent MI, new-onset heart failure, and CVD death. Second, the
present study specifically evaluated the risk of MI in patients with
ACHD, which is the most serious presentation of ischaemic heart
disease other than sudden cardiac death. Third, the present study
included patients with ACHD who were >_40 years, which is the age
when atherosclerotic disease starts to clinically manifest.

Our study also had several limitations. First, the ACHD and outcome diagnoses were based on ICD codes. As with all registry data,
there is the potential for miscoding and misclassification of the diagnoses. Furthermore, as the 8th, 9th, and 10th versions of the ICD
were used, there might have been inaccuracies in the translation of
the ACHD diagnoses between versions. However, a previous study
validated many of the diagnoses in the NPR, including MI.23 We used
a hierarchical classification system that classifies the ACHD diagnoses
into six different lesion groups. However, there is a potential that the
patients within each group are somewhat heterogeneous in the
ACHD severity. Hence, we believe that there is scope for larger,
more detailed datasets to be examined before we can draw firm conclusions on the more precise or isolated ACHD diagnoses. Second,
as the follow-up started in 1970, we do not have reliable information
on the incidence of MI and death in patients with ACHD before
1970, leading to an immortal time bias. Also, data on emigration were
not available. Third, it was not possible to reliably establish how many
patients underwent surgical procedures and how previous surgeries
affected the risk of MI. Fourth, we did not have access to individual
patient's medical records to ascertain the clinical details of the MI
type and cardiovascular risk factors such as smoking, cholesterol, and
physical activity levels. Furthermore, some cardiovascular risk factors
(such as hypercholesterolaemia and hypertension) are not reliably
registered in the NPR, as they are often treated in primary care only.
However, to minimize the risk of missing potential cardiovascular risk
factors, patients were considered to have hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, and diabetes mellitus if the diagnoses were discovered
before or within 1 year of the index MI. Nevertheless, adjusting for
the risk factors did not differ significantly between the adjusted and
unadjusted models. Fifth, since the patients had their MI between
1970 and 2017, a substantial proportion of patients were treated in
the pre-interventional era when mortality after MI was higher compared to the current era. The total proportion of patients who
underwent interventional treatment was therefore lower compared
to present time. Finally, as primary care diagnoses are not reported
to the NPR, a small proportion of patients with primarily mild ACHD
lesions who never presented to a hospital may not have been identified in the NPR.

Conclusion
Compared with controls, patients with ACHD who were older than
40 years had a 1.6-fold increased risk of MI and this increased risk persisted after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors. After index MI,
patients with ACHD had a 1.4-fold higher risk of a composite event
(recurrent MI, new-onset heart failure, or CVD death) and a greater
number of total events after MI compared with controls, which were
driven mainly by patients with ACHD experiencing markedly more
heart failure-related hospitalizations, outpatient visits, and deaths due
to heart failure compared with controls. The long-term risk of mortality was only slightly higher in patients with ACHD compared with
controls. Recognizing and managing the modifiable cardiovascular
risk factors should be of importance to reduce the morbidity and
mortality in patients with ACHD.

the death register as well as MI identified in outpatient clinics. We
found that 50% of the patients with an MI had a registered ACHD
diagnosis at the time of their MI. This is most likely due to a significant
number of the patients had not been hospitalized before their index
MI, or the hospitalizations occurred before the year 1970 when the
follow-up in the registers began. The outpatient register was initiated
first in 2001.
In the present study, 60% of patients with ACHD and 45% of
controls experienced recurrent MI, new-onset heart failure, or
CVD death during follow-up after index MI. Our findings are in
line with a previous report of outcomes after MI in the general
population where 20% of MI-survivors experienced a recurrent
cardiovascular event in the first year and an additional 20% within
the next 2 years.19
Our findings are consistent with other registry studies on the risk
of MI or acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with ACHD.
Olsen et al.7 found that the risk of MI in patients with ACHD who are
older than 30 years is doubled compared with controls (HR 2.0, CI
1.7-2.3). Saha et al.10 found that the risk of ACS and other cardiovascular endpoints in patients with lower-complexity ACHD is approximately twice as high as that of controls, after adjustment for
cardiovascular risk factors. Whether an 'ACHD-related' factor10 or
traditional cardiovascular risk factors20 is the most important for the
development of CAD in patients with ACHD is not known.
The present study supports the hypothesis that 'ACHD-related'
factors contribute to the increased risk of cardiovascular events in
patients with ACHD, as the risk of MI in patients with ACHD
remained higher than that in controls even after adjustments for diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hypercholesterolaemia. Other studies have also reported that the risk of ischaemic heart disease and
ACS is up to 16.5 times higher in young patients with ACHD than in
controls.11,12 Furthermore, the present study found that the relative
risk of MI was highest in the youngest patients (follow-up period 0-
15 years), suggesting that the 'ACHD-related' factor is more important in younger patients. The increased risk may be due to factors
such as previous surgical treatments (manipulation of coronary
arteries in the arterial switch procedure) and coronary anomalies.21,22 Screening for modifiable cardiovascular risk factors in
patients with ACHD should be considered, and good risk factor control is likely to be very important in order to further improve the
long-term survival of patients with ACHD.
