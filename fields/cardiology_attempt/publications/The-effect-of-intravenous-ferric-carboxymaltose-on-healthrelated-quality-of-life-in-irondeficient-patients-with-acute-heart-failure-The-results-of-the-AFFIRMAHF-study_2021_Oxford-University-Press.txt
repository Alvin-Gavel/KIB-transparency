The effect of intravenous ferric carboxymaltose
on health-related quality of life in iron-deficient
patients with acute heart failure: the results of
the AFFIRM-AHF study

3012

E.A. Jankowska et al.

Aims

Patients with heart failure (HF) and iron deficiency experience poor health-related quality of life (HRQoL). We
evaluated the impact of intravenous (IV) ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) vs. placebo on HRQoL for the AFFIRM-AHF
population.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
The baseline 12-item Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ-12), which was completed for 1058
(535 and 523) patients in the FCM and placebo groups, respectively, was administered prior to randomization and
and results

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
In iron-deficient patients with HF and left ventricular ejection fraction <50% who had stabilized after an episode of

acute HF, treatment with IV FCM, compared with placebo, results in clinically meaningful beneficial effects on
HRQoL as early as 4 weeks after treatment initiation, lasting up to Week 24.

at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 36, and 52. The baseline KCCQ-12 overall summary score (OSS) mean +/- standard error
was 38.7 +/- 0.9 (FCM group) and 37.1 +/- 0.8 (placebo group); corresponding values for the clinical summary score
(CSS) were 40.9 +/- 0.9 and 40.1 +/- 0.9. At Week 2, changes in OSS and CSS were similar for FCM and placebo.
From Week 4 to Week 24, patients assigned to FCM had significantly greater improvements in OSS and CSS
scores vs. placebo [adjusted mean difference (95% confidence interval, CI) at Week 4: 2.9 (0.5-5.3, P = 0.018) for
OSS and 2.8 (0.3-5.3, P = 0.029) for CSS; adjusted mean difference (95% CI) at Week 24: 3.0 (0.3-5.6, P = 0.028)
for OSS and 2.9 (0.2-5.6, P = 0.035) for CSS]. At Week 52, the treatment effect had attenuated but remained in favour of FCM.

Effect of IV FCM on HRQoL in iron-deficient acute HF patients

Methods
Study design and population
The rationale and design of the AFFIRM-AHF trial has been previously
published.17 Briefly, the AFFIRM-AHF trial was a double-blind, placebocontrolled trial in which eligible subjects were 18 years or older and hospitalized with clinical signs, symptoms, and biomarkers consistent with
acute HF. During the index hospitalization, patients had to have received
at least 40 mg of IV furosemide (or equivalent) and an LVEF <50% within
12 months prior to randomization. In addition, patients had to be iron-deficient, defined as serum ferritin <100 ng/mL, or between 100 and 299 ng/
mL with transferrin saturation <20%.16,17 Iron status was assessed on the
basis of serum ferritin and transferrin saturation, with measurement
allowed at any time during the index hospitalization.
Prior to discharge, eligible patients were randomly (1:1) assigned to receive either IV FCM or placebo. The total FCM dose required for repletion was calculated using baseline haemoglobin and body weight, and the
repletion dose was administered at two time points (i.e. at discharge and
Week 6). The first and subsequently administered doses were up to
1000 mg FCM (or placebo). At Weeks 12 and 24, if ID persisted, additional FCM doses of 500 mg (or placebo) were administered.16,17
The protocol was approved by the institutional review board at each
participating centre. Written informed consent was obtained from all
patients before any study-related procedures were performed. The first
and the last authors (E.A.J. and P.P.) had full access to the data, and took
responsibility for its integrity and analysis.
Assessment of HRQoL in the whole trial cohort using the KCCQ-12
was prospectively planned and was specified among other outcomes in
the statistical analysis plan (SAP). The primary composite outcome of
AFFIRM-AHF was recurrent HF hospitalizations and cardiovascular
death, and there were five clinical secondary outcomes.

Health status outcome measures
The KCCQ-12 was used to evaluate the HF-specific health status.18 The
KCCQ-12 is a self-administered, disease-specific instrument for

.. measuring HF-specific health status, regardless of HF aetiology. It is a 12..
.. item questionnaire that quantifies physical function, symptoms (fre.. quency, severity and recent change), social function, self-efficacy and
..
.. knowledge, and quality of life.6,18,19
..
To simplify the clinical interpretation, all scores and subscores are rep..
.. resented on a scale from 0 to 100, in which lower scores represent com.. paratively more severe symptoms and/or limitations, and a score of 100
.. indicates no symptoms, no limitations, and excellent quality of life.18,19
..
.. The KCCQ-12 tool is used to estimate the OSS, which includes pooled
.. information on symptoms, physical and social functioning and perception
..
.. of quality of life, whereas the CSS includes pooled information reflecting
.. mainly symptoms and physical and social functioning of an examined pa.. tient. In addition to two summary scores, four domains can be derived in
..
.. order to separately describe physical limitation, symptom frequency,
.. quality of life, and social limitation.
..
The baseline KCCQ-12 was administered just prior to randomization
..
.. during the index hospitalization. Patients completed the paper-based ver.. sion of the questionnaire, and validated translations were used in coun..
.. tries where English was not the mother tongue. During follow-up, the
.. KCCQ-12 was completed by patients at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 36, and 52.
..
.. Participants were placed in a quiet environment and requested to com.. plete the KCCQ-12 prior to any other assessment or procedure being
.. performed at the visit concerned. For visits conducted by telephone (i.e.
..
.. visits at Weeks 2, 4, and 36 post-randomization), participants were
.. requested to complete the KCCQ-12 just prior to the call and to return
..
.. the completed questionnaire at the next scheduled outpatient visit.
..
..
.. Statistical analyses
..
.. For each visit as described above, the KCCQ OSS and KCCQ CSS were
.. calculated. The actual values and change from baseline in these two sum..
.. mary scores were descriptively summarized at each visit. The treatment
.. difference in KCCQ-12 scores (one model for each summary score) at
.. Weeks 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 36, and 52 were analysed by comparing the model..
.. adjusted means of the respective visits based on a repeated-measures
.. model adjusted for corresponding baseline KCCQ-12 value, sex, age at
..
.. randomization (<70 years/>_70 years), HF aetiology at randomization (is.. chaemic/non-ischaemic/unknown), HF duration (newly diagnosed at
.. index hospitalization/known documented HF prior to index hospitaliza..
.. tion), country, time, treatment, and treatment-by-time interaction using
.. an unstructured covariance matrix to model the within-subject variability.
..
.. Similar analyses were carried out using unadjusted models.
..
into consideration the COVID-19 pandemic, which interfered
.. withTaking
the
progress
of the trial and which could potentially have affected
..
.. the subjective assessment of quality of life, COVID-19 sensitivity analyses
.. were performed using adjusted and unadjusted models. In these analyses,
..
.. all KCCQ-12 assessments occurring after the date when the first
.. COVID-19 case was diagnosed in each country were deleted and were
.. considered as missing values without any imputation.
..
..
In order to evaluate the consistency of the treatment effect, differen.. ces in adjusted mean changes in the KCCQ-12 OSS and CSS from base..
.. line to Week 24 with IV FCM compared with placebo were assessed in
.. 22 pre-specified subgroups.
..
The pre-specified analyses of the KCCQ-12 described in the SAP did
..
.. not include any imputations for death. An additional sensitivity analysis
.. with imputed values accounting for patient mortality was performed, in
..
.. which KCCQ-12 values for patients who were dead at the time of the
.. scheduled assessment were assigned 0 points (worst health status).
..
Responder analyses were performed, examining the proportion of
..
.. patients with a deterioration or an improvement in KCCQ-12 during sub.. sequent study visits. We used thresholds that had been established as
..
. clinically meaningful for KCCQ for patients with stable chronic HF.19,20

improvement in health status (symptoms, function, and quality of life)
is one of the major therapeutic goals in the management of these
patients.3 This view has also been acknowledged and endorsed by
regulatory authorities and by the patients themselves.7-9
Iron deficiency (ID) negatively impacts upon symptom burden, exercise capacity, and quality of life in HF patients.10-12 Randomized
controlled trials have demonstrated that intravenous (IV) ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) alleviates symptoms, and improves exercise capacity and quality of life in ambulatory iron-deficient patients with
chronic HF and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <_45%.13-15
The AFFIRM-AHF trial, which was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, demonstrated that administration of IV FCM in
iron-deficient patients who had stabilized after an acute HF episode
reduced the risk of recurrent HF hospitalizations.16 The effect of IV
FCM on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in this high-risk population has not been previously investigated-the latter was one of
the predefined other secondary outcomes in the AFFIRM-AHF trial.
In this analysis, we evaluated the effect of IV FCM, compared with placebo, administered just prior to discharge in patients with acute HF
and ID on the 12-item Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire
(KCCQ-12) overall summary score (OSS) and clinical summary
score (CSS) up to 52 weeks after randomization.

Results
Baseline characteristics
Among the 1108 patients included in the modified intention-to-treat
AFFIRM-AHF analysis, a baseline KCCQ-12 was completed for 1058
(95%) patients (535 and 523 in the FCM and placebo groups, respectively). The baseline characteristics of the patients who completed the
baseline KCCQ-12 were comparable between the two study groups
(Table 1).
Overall, the KCCQ-12 completion rate decreased from 96% at
Week 2 to 73% at Week 52 (Figure 1). The proportion of patients
who did not complete the questionnaire during follow-up were similar in both the FCM and placebo groups.
The KCCQ-12 OSS and CSS scores were similar and markedly
impaired at baseline for both study groups. The mean (+/- standard
error) KCCQ-12 OSS scores in the FCM and placebo groups were
38.1 +/- 0.9 points and 37.1 +/- 0.8 points, respectively. The mean
KCCQ-12 CSS scores in the FCM and placebo groups were
40.9 +/- 0.9 points and 40.1 +/- 0.9 points, respectively.
During the course of the trial, 5 patients in the FCM arm (0.9%)
and 13 patients in the placebo arm (2.4%) received open-label IV iron
preparations beyond the study treatment (see Supplementary material online, Table S1 for details).

Changes in KCCQ scores
The mean adjusted changes from baseline in the KCCQ-12 OSS for
both study groups are presented in Figure 2A. In both the FCM and
placebo groups, the mean KCCQ-12 OSS score improved at 2 weeks
post-discharge (by th18.5 +/- 1.2 points and th17.2 +/- 1.2 points in the
FCM and placebo groups, respectively). The difference in OSS score
change between FCM and placebo was not statistically significant
(P = 0.277). As of Week 4 and up to Week 24 (i.e. end of the treatment period), the difference in OSS score was statistically significant
in favour of FCM, with a mean change of th2.9 (95% CI 0.5-5.3,
P = 0.018) and th3.0 (95% CI 0.3-5.6, P = 0.028) at Weeks 4 and 24,
respectively. These results were also consistent across the KCCQ12 CSS (Figure 2B). At Week 2 post-discharge, changes in CSS were
similar between FCM and placebo (th20.94 +/- 1.18 and th20.10 +/- 1.21,
respectively). The CSS mean change in favour of FCM at Week 4 and
Week 24 was th2.8 (95% CI 0.3-5.3, P = 0.029) and th2.9 (95% CI
0.2-5.6, P = 0.035), respectively. At Week 52, the treatment effect
was still present but in an attenuated manner [differences in adjusted
mean changes for OSS and CSS at Week 52 were th1.44 (95% CI -
1.45 to th4.33) and th0.63 (95% CI -2.21 to th3.47), respectively].

..
The COVID-19 sensitivity analyses (which excluded data on qual..
.. ity of life obtained after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic)
..
.. using the adjusted model confirmed that the pattern of changes in the
.. KCCQ-12 OSS and CSS and differences between the two treatment
..
.. groups were similar to the results obtained for the complete follow.. up (Supplementary material online, Figure S1A and B).
..
The pattern of KCCQ-12 score changes and differences between
..
.. the two treatment groups in analyses with unadjusted models were
..
.. in agreement with those demonstrated with adjusted models, both
.. for the overall study population (Supplementary material online,
..
.. Figure S2) and for the COVID-19 sensitivity analysis population
.. (Supplementary material online, Figure S1C and D).
..
..
The sensitivity analysis that incorporated imputed values to ac.. count for death of patients into the model (see Methods section for
..
.. details) also showed a pattern of changes in the KCCQ-12 OSS and
.. CSS and differences between study arms that were similar to that for
..
.. the main results.
..
The effects of IV FCM, in comparison with placebo, on the KCCQ..
.. 12 OSS and CSS scores were assessed in 22 pre-specified subgroups
.. (Supplementary material online, Figure S3).
..
..
..
.. Responder analyses
.. In the responder analyses, numerically fewer patients treated with
..
.. FCM had a clinically meaningful deterioration (>_5-point decline in the
.. KCCQ-12 OSS), and a greater proportion of patients had a clinically
..
.. meaningful improvement in the KCCQ-12 OSS at Weeks 12 and 24,
.. compared with the placebo group, although these results did not
..
.. reach statistical significance (Figure 3A and C). An analogous pattern of
..
.. responder analyses was seen for the KCCQ-12 CSS in the FCM
.. group, compared with the placebo group (Figure 3B and D).
..
..
..
..
.. Discussion
..
.. In this pre-specified analysis of the AFFIRM-AHF trial, we observed
..
.. that patients who had stabilized after an episode of acute HF and
.. who had concomitant ID had severely impaired HRQoL at baseline,
..
.. and after discharge experienced an improvement in health status dur.. ing follow-up. Compared with placebo, patients treated with IV FCM
..
.. had significantly greater improvements in health status starting at
..
.. Week 4, and continuing up to Week 24, with a subsequent attenu.. ation of treatment benefit by Week 52 (Graphical abstract).
..
Improving symptoms, function and quality of life is an important
..
.. standalone target of therapy for patients with HF.19 Previous analyses
..
.. have identified IV iron as being one of a very limited number of HF
.. treatments that is able to confer improvements in HRQoL.5
..
.. Collectively, data on the impact of various treatments on health sta.. tus have become an integral part of evaluating therapies and improv..
.. ing care for this high-risk patient population. Only a few interventions
.. have demonstrated benefits in terms of health status in patients with
..
.. chronic HF with reduced ejection fraction: these include dapagliflo.. zin,21 empagliflozin,22 sacubitril/valsartan,23 exercise training,24 self..
.. management interventions with or without remote monitoring,25,26
.. and IV FCM.13-15 Importantly, the modest effects of these therapies

.. (a net effect of th1.5-3.0 points of the KCCQ, at maximum) have
.. been demonstrated in three- to four-fold larger studies and under

The number and percentage of subjects with respective improvements of
>_5, >_8, >_10, >_20, and >_30 points and deterioration of >_5 points in
KCCQ-12 OSS and CSS scores were assessed for the FCM and placebo
groups. Odds ratios to estimate differences between the study groups
(FCM vs. placebo) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals
(CIs) and two-sided P-values were estimated from logistic regression
models.
Missing data were not imputed. The number of missing values were
reported with the identification of missing values due to death. A P-value
of <0.05 was considered statistically significant and no adjustments for
multiple testing were carried out.

patients recovering from acute HF. Beyond pharmacotherapies with
demonstrated benefits on quality of life in patients with HF, the beneficial effects of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) merit attention. Although the heterogeneity in clinical response to CRT
(including improvement in clinical status and quality of life) is commonly acknowledged, selected patients ('good responders') benefit
from a clinically meaningful improvement in quality of life, as demonstrated by an increase in KCCQ score exceeding 10 points.27,28
In other recently reported trials (EVEREST18 and SOLOISTWHF29) patients with a recent episode of acute HF also demonstrated a markedly impaired HRQoL. These observations justify the
particular need to consider this poor quality of life seen in patients
directly after an episode of acute HF as an important therapeutic
target.
The 23-item KCCQ is an instrument for measuring HRQoL in
patients with HF and has excellent psychometric properties, but its
major limitation for its broader use in clinical practice is its length, so
it requires several minutes for patients to complete.18,19 Therefore,
we used a shorter and simpler measure (the KCCQ-12 derived and
validated from the 23-item KCCQ), which allows the capture of
symptom frequency, physical and social limitations, and quality of life
impairment as a result of HF, as well as an OSS. The KCCQ-12 has
been demonstrated to have high correlations with the original
23-item tool and high test-retest reliability, as well as comparable
prognostic significance and interpretation of clinically important differences, compared with the 23-item KCCQ.18,19
In the AFFIRM-AHF study, we demonstrated the favourable effects
of IV FCM treatment on KCCQ-12 OSS and CSS scores, which were
statistically significant and clinically relevant between Weeks 4 and
24. It has been established that a two to three-point mean improvement in the KCCQ score translates into a relevant increase in subjective patient wellbeing.19,20 In the AFFIRM-AHF trial, the beneficial
effect of IV FCM treatment, compared to placebo, on the KCCQ-12
OSS and CSS scores was persistent up to Week 24, which was the
end of the treatment phase. This suggests that treatment with FCM in

these acutely ill patients positively impacts HRQoL, and the positive
effect of FCM appears to correspond with the time points of IV FCM
administration. Indeed, a diminishing proportion of patients with fully
repleted iron status following treatment cessation may have contributed to the reduced quality of life benefit seen at Weeks 36 and 52.
FCM was given at baseline and Week 6 in the vast majority of patients
(i.e. 80% of patients in the FCM arm). In the FCM arm, only 20%
required further administration of the drug at Weeks 12 and/or 24. In
the placebo arm, approximately 50% of patients received the
assigned therapy at either Week 12 and/or Week 24. The discontinuation of therapy (regardless of whether a placebo or an active drug
was administered) could have had an impact on the subjective perception of quality of life by the patients.
We have demonstrated a significant increase in KCCQ-12 OSS
and CSS scores as early as Week 2, which was evident in both FCM
and placebo arms. The 'spontaneous improvement' in the placebo
arm reached th17.2 +/- 1.2 points and th20.1 +/- 1.2 points for, respectively, the KCCQ-12 OSS and CSS, and was even more pronounced
in the FCM group. Comparable patterns and magnitudes of changes
in the KCCQ-12 OSS and CSS scores in patients having recently
undergone hospitalization for acute HF have already been reported
in the EVEREST trial (e.g. a change of th21.8 +/- 21.3 points in KCCQ12 OSS after 1 week in the placebo arm)18 and in the SOLOISTWHF trial (an increase of 13.6 points in KCCQ-12 OSS at Month 4 in
the placebo arm).29 Taking into consideration the important effect of
'spontaneous' improvement seen in the placebo group for the
KCCQ-12 OSS and CSS scores, which is probably associated with
the intensification of HF treatment during the index hospitalization,
the traditional KCCQ-12 thresholds for responder analyses derived
and validated for chronic settings are less meaningful and make the
methodological approach much more challenging in the context of a
recent episode of acute HF. Therefore, it is not surprising that the
proportion of patients treated with FCM vs. placebo that experienced deterioration in health status was consistently numerically
lower, and the proportion of patients with clinically meaningful

improvements established for chronic settings was numerically
greater, although none of these differences reached statistical significance. The reported responder analyses for the KCCQ-12 OSS and
CSS scores using the cut-off values validated for stable clinical settings
are therefore not meaningful in a post-acute HF patient population,
where the overwhelming majority of patients experience substantial
improvements regardless of treatment. Additionally, it is important to
distinguish between the clinically relevant difference in average
KCCQ scores when compared between study groups (analysed collectively) and the clinically relevant change in KCCQ score for individual subjects. It should be emphasized that a difference of >_2-3 points
in average KCCQ scores compared between study groups has been

Recently, the KCCQ-12 data were reported in the SOLOISTWHF trial, but the follow-up assessment was limited to a single
time point.29 Taking into consideration the magnitude of dynamic
changes seen in our trial after an episode of acute HF, being in contrast to patterns seen in stable cohorts, any conclusion about the
clinical significance of reported changes in the KCCQ-12 in postacute settings on the basis of standards developed in chronic settings needs to be considered with caution.
The primary analysis of AFFIRM-AHF showed a beneficial effect
of IV FCM vs. placebo in the reduction in recurrent HF hospitalization in patients who were stabilized after an episode of acute HF.
Our analysis provides evidence that these patients also benefit
from an improvement in HRQoL. There is undoubtedly a relationship between HF hospitalizations and a subjective perception of
quality of life in patients with HF, and the distinction between these
two effects of any applied therapy is difficult. One may argue that
the reported benefits in quality of life are just a reflection of fewer

hospitalizations for HF. However, it needs to be emphasized that
in the AFFIRM-AHF trial, all follow-up KCCQ-12 assessments were
performed during ambulatory visits-hence the data for patients
who were hospitalized at that time of scheduled assessments were
missing and, as per the protocol, no data imputation was applied.
Therefore, we could conclude that the changes in quality of life
reported in this paper are independent of any direct influence of
recent HF hospitalizations that patients could experience. There is
no doubt that if the KCCQ assessments had been performed at
the time of hospitalization and had been imputed in the model, the
gradients in quality of life benefits would have been much more
prominent.
In iron-deficient patients with HF and an LVEF <50% who had stabilized after an episode of acute HF, treatment with IV FCM, compared with placebo, results in clinically meaningful beneficial effects
on quality of life as early as 4 weeks after treatment initiation that last
up to Week 24.
