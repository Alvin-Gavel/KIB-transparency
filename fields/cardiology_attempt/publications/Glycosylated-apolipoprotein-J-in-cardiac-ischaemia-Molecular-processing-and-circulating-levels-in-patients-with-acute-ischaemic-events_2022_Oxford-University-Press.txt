Aim

Using proteomics, we previously found that serum levels of glycosylated (Glyc) forms of apolipoprotein J (ApoJ), a
cytoprotective and anti-oxidant protein, decrease in the early phase of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). We
aimed to investigate: (i) ApoJ-Glyc intracellular distribution and secretion during ischaemia; (ii) the early changes in
circulating ApoJ-Glyc during AMI; and (iii) associations between ApoJ-Glyc and residual ischaemic risk post-AMI.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
Glycosylated apolipoprotein J was investigated in: (i) cells from different organ/tissue origin; (ii) a pig model of AMI;
(iii) de novo AMI patients (n = 38) at admission within the first 6 h of chest pain onset and without troponin T elevaand results

tion at presentation (early AMI); (iv) ST-elevation myocardial infarction patients (n = 212) who were followed up
for 6 months; and (v) a control group without any overt cardiovascular disease (n = 144). Inducing simulated ischaemia in isolated cardiac cells resulted in an increased intracellular accumulation of non-glycosylated ApoJ forms. A
significant decrease in ApoJ-Glyc circulating levels was seen 15 min after ischaemia onset in pigs. Glycosylated apolipoprotein J levels showed a 45% decrease in early AMI patients compared with non-ischaemic patients
(P < 0.0001), discriminating the presence of the ischaemic event (area under the curve: 0.934; P < 0.0001). STelevation myocardial infarction patients with lower ApoJ-Glyc levels at admission showed a higher rate of recurrent
ischaemic events and mortality after 6-month follow-up (P = 0.008).

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusions
These results indicate that ischaemia induces an intracellular accumulation of non-glycosylated ApoJ and a reduction in ApoJ-Glyc secretion. Glycosylated apolipoprotein J circulating levels are reduced very early after ischaemia
onset. Its continuous decrease indicates a worsening in the evolution of the cardiac event, likely identifying patients
with sustained ischaemia after AMI.

Translational perspective
This study highlights a potential role of glycosylated apolipoprotein J (ApoJ-Glyc) as a protein marker sensitive to the early ischaemic injury in acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Due to its rapid and specific changes in cardiac cells under simulated ischaemic conditions and
the early decrease in its circulating levels, ApoJ-Glyc appears as a protein that, if further validated, could be used in mapping the initiation and progression of ischaemic events. Therefore, ApoJ-Glyc could represent a novel biomarker for the early detection of ischaemia
with a potential added value in risk assessment post-AMI.

Introduction
The diagnosis and management of acute coronary syndromes (ACS)
are based on clinical assessment, electrocardiogram (ECG) findings
and troponin (Tn) levels, the most often used biomarker.1,2 Due to
their intracellular structural role, cardiac Tn are excellent markers of
irreversible cell damage. Evidence has shown that the earliest Tn elevations are associated with cardiomyocyte apoptosis,3 highlighting
that some type of irreversible cell death is needed for Tn to be
released. Troponin is elevated in many cardiovascular diseases, such
as heart failure, aortic dissection, myocarditis, takotsubo cardiomyopathy, and atrial fibrillation among others,4,5 making Tn a specific

biomarker of cardiac injury. Undetectable levels of high-sensitivity Tn
(hs-Tn) at admission, in patients presenting 1-3 h after the onset of
chest pain, with an ECG without ischaemic changes may rule out an
acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with a good sensitivity in one-third
of the patients. However, there are some limitations in patients aged
65 years or less due to an increased risk of false-negative results.5,6
Indeed, a final confirmatory test for safe discharge, such as exercise
ECG or non-invasive stress testing, has been recommended in lowrisk patients.7,8 Still, the application of this protocol implies longer
length of hospital stay, potentially unnecessary testing and higher
costs, without clearly showing a direct benefit.8,9 In this context, a
specific biomarker of ischaemia, in combination with Tn, should allow

Glycosylated apolipoprotein J as a novel marker of ischaemia. Under ischaemic conditions there is a decrease in the secretion of glycosylated apolipoprotein J. The quantification of specific glycosylated apolipoprotein J variants with a novel immunoassay discriminates the presence of a cardiac ischaemic
event, indicating that glycosylated apolipoprotein J could be a novel marker of cardiac ischaemia.

Materials and methods

Materials and Methods.

In vitro studies
In vitro cell culture experiments were used to investigate the influence of
simulated ischaemia in the intracellular ApoJ forms and their secretion profile. Cells from different organ/tissue origin (cardiac, hepatic, endothelial,
and vascular) were investigated (Supplementary material online, Figure
S2A). The secretion pattern, glycosylation profile, and intracellular distribution of ApoJ-Glyc were analysed in normoxic, hypoxic (1% O2), and simulated ischaemia (1% O2 and acidic conditions by nutrient deprivation only
with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at pH 6.4, as previously described)16
conditions for 1, 2, 4, and 8 h (Supplementary material online, Figure S2A).
Specifically, primary cultures of porcine ventricular cardiac fibroblasts
(PVCFs), mouse atrial cardiomyocytes line HL-1, human liver cell line
HepG2, human hepatic mesenchymal cells (Stellate), human umbilical vein
endothelial cells (HUVEC), and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) from
coronary artery explants (without plaque) from heart transplant recipients
with non-ischaemic (dilated) cardiomyopathy were expanded as previously
described.17,18

Proof-of-concept in induced pluripotent stem derived
human cardiomyocytes
Cellartis human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell line 22 differentiated
to cardiomyocytes was used to further confirm the observed changes in
ApoJ-Glyc secretion profile in cells of human origin. Differentiation was
carried out following manufacturer's instructions and confirmed by western blot for troponin T (TnT) and Nkx-2.5 for each culture. After differentiation, cardiomyocytes were incubated for 4 h either in normoxia,
hypoxia, or simulated ischaemia (following the same protocol as the one
used with the other cell types).

..
.. Analysis of culture media
.. Glycosylated apolipoprotein J released to the culture medium was ana.. lysed by measuring ApoJ-Glyc with the lectin-based immunoassay. In this
..
.. assay, no sample pre-treatment was carried out and, thus, crude cell cul.. ture medium was directly used for running the assay for the specific de..
.. tection of ApoJ-Glyc variants. If ApoJ-Glyc concentration in the media
.. was below 7.8 ng/mL [limit of detection (LOD) of the assay], the absorb..
.. ance of the sample was similar to blank and no ApoJ-Glyc concentration
.. could be obtained by extrapolation in the standard curve.
..
Glycosylated apolipoprotein J levels, using this immunoassay, were de..
.. tectable only in PVCF, VSMC and iPS cells differentiatied to cardiomyo..
.. cytes whereas, in the other cell types (HL-1, HepG2, Stellate, and
.. HUVEC), the concentration in the medium was below the LOD.

To further confirm the presence of ApoJ-Glyc in the medium of all
..

.. medium of all the different cell types so that enough protein material
..
.. was obtained to run a western blot analysis. Deglycosylation and
.. western blot analysis were carried out as previously described.15,19 In
..
.. this assay, the relative amount of ApoJ-Glyc that was present in the
.. sample is estimated based on the ratio between the ApoJ that is degly..
.. cosylated and the total ApoJ that is detected prior to running the
.. deglycosylation.15,19

the rapid identification of the ischaemic event in those patients with
undetectable Tn levels, unconclusive Tn/ECG results, or other criteria indicating a low probability of an event.
Currently, there are no accepted biomarkers able to detect the initial ischaemic cell damage before it develops into cell death and necrosis; therefore, there is a need for further understanding of signals
that may differentiate between ischaemia and necrosis.10 Thus, the
search has continued for biomarkers of ischaemia that may be translated into an improved management algorithm for patients in the
early phase of myocardial ischaemia.2,11-14
In a previous proteomic study, we focused on the assessment of
protein glycosylations and we described, for the first time, a shift in
the glycosylation profile of apolipoprotein J (ApoJ; also known as
clusterin) in the early phase of ischaemia (Supplementary material online, Figure S1).15
Here, we investigated, using cellular and preclinical experimental modelling, as well as performing clinical studies: (i) glycosylated
ApoJ (ApoJ-Glyc) intracellular distribution and secretion in different cells and its changes during ischaemia; (ii) the early changes in
circulating ApoJ-Glyc during acute myocardial ischaemia; and (iii)
the relationship between ApoJ-Glyc levels and residual ischaemic
risk post-AMI.

event presentation (n = 212; Table 2).
Inclusion criteria were >_18 years of age, provision of signed informed
consent and diagnosis of STEMI based on the following criteria: first, STsegment elevation in two contiguous leads of >_0.25 mV in men below the
age of 40 years, >_0.2 mV in men over the age of 40 years, or >_0.15 mV in
women in leads V2-V3, and/or >_0.1 mV in other leads (in the absence of
left ventricular hypertrophy or left bundle branch block); and second,
meeting the third universal definition of myocardial infarction criteria.13
Exclusion criteria were patients transferred to the hospital after primary
percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) performed in another hospital,
or absence of an acute coronary occlusion at the time of coronary angiography. Patients were admitted to the hospital between December
2011 and December 2014.
Among the 212 STEMI patients who were included, a total of 206
were reperfused (205 through PCI and 1 through emergent surgical
revascularization). There was 1 patient in whom catheterization was not
possible due to existing co-morbidities. In the remaining patients (n = 5),
PCI was unsuccessful. Myocardial blush grade (MBG) could be assessed in
199 patients as an indicator of status of the microcirculation; among
these, 129 had an MBG of 3, 46 had an MBG of 2, 21 had an MBG of 1,
and 3 had an MBG of 0.
Freshly drawn venous blood samples were collected at the moment of
admission (t = 0), and in a subset of 82 patients, an additional blood sampling was performed at 72 h post-admission. Samples were immediately
processed and were aliquoted and stored at -80 C until the ApoJ-Glyc
analysis was carried out in batches.

The study comprised two groups of patients.
Group 1: Patients who were admitted to the emergency room with a
time frame from symptom onset to admission and initial blood sample
collection of 2.5 h (1.9-3.2 h) fmedian [interquartile range (IQR)]g and
showed negative conventional TnT levels at admission with a subsequent
rise above the 99th percentile upper reference limit after the first blood
sampling (early-AMI; n = 38; Table 1).
Inclusion criteria were >_18 years of age, provision of signed informed
consent, and diagnosis of AMI, consistent with the third universal definition of myocardial infarction,13 in a subset of patients who met the following criteria: (i) admission to hospital within the first 6 h after the onset
of chest pain with typical ischaemic symptoms; (ii) ST-segment elevation
0.2 mV in at least two contiguous leads; and (iii) negative conventional
TnT levels at admission (excluding subacute myocardial infarction) with a
subsequent increase to a level greater than the 99th percentile upper reference limit. Exclusion criteria were a previous documented or suspected
myocardial infarction and antithrombotic treatment because of the onset
of AMI before arriving to the emergency department and time of blood
collection. Patients were admitted to the hospital between February
2004 and April 2005.

Glycosylated Apo J in cardiac ischaemia

A group of 'healthy volunteers' without overt cardiovascular
disease was used as a control group. Demographic and clinical characteristics of the control group and the AMI cohorts are shown in Tables 1
and 2.
The Ethical Committee of the Santa Creu i Sant Pau Hospital approved
the project and the studies were conducted according to the principles of
the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants gave written informed consent to take part in the study. Reporting of the study conforms to the
STROBE guidelines.23

Non-parametric Mann-Whitney (n = 2) or Kruskal-Wallis (n > 2) tests
were used for comparison between groups and Wilcoxon analysis for
comparison between different time points (i.e. ApoJ-Glyc levels between
the moment of admission and 3 days after in cohort 2). Bivariate correlations between variables were determined by Pearson correlation coefficients. v2 test or Fisher's exact test, when any of the expected values was
<5, was used for categorical variables.
To determine the correlation between ApoJ-Glyc levels, anthropometric parameters (age, sex and body mass index), risk factors (diabetes,
hypertension, dyslipidaemia, tobacco), background treatment, and biochemical parameters [total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), glucose
and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels], we first performed bivariate analyses by correlation (for continuous variables) or by t-test (for categorical
variables). This analysis allowed us to find the parameters that showed an
influence on the levels of ApoJ-Glyc in each cohort of patients (variables
with a significant P-value in the bivariate analysis in Supplementary material online, Tables S1 and S2). Those variables were afterward included in a
multiple linear regression analysis (stepwise selection of variables) to assess those that remained as independent factors for ApoJ-Glyc levels.
Receiver operating characteristic curves (to assess the discriminating
power of selected variables) and Kaplan-Meier curves (to carry out survival analyses) were performed with IBM SPSS Statistics v19.0. A P-value
of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Quantification of glycosylated
apolipoprotein J levels
Glycosylated apolipoprotein J levels in samples from in vitro experiments
(culture media), from the in vivo pig model (systemic levels), and from the
two cohorts of patients (systemic levels) were measured with a novel
lectin-based immunoassay that allows their specific detection and quantification (see Supplementary material online, Material and Methods). This
immunoassay shows an intra- and inter-assay variability comparable to
that of commercially available ELISAs to detect total protein levels
(mean +/- desvest: intra-assay variability: 3.8 +/- 1.8; inter-assay variability:
8.05 +/- 2.02; day-to-day variability: 8.1 +/- 4.4; assessed in 9 samples with 10
replicates per sample in two independent plates and two nonconsecutive days). The LOD is 7.8 ng/mL.

Results
Glycosylated apolipoprotein J secretion
profile by isolated cardiac cells in culture
under simulated ischaemic conditions
Porcine ventricular cardiac fibroblast subjected to simulated ischaemia showed a time-dependent decrease in the secretion of ApoJGlyc (Figure 1A) whereas hypoxia alone (O2 deprivation) was not
able to induce the same changes. The decrease was evident as early
as in 1 h (16% vs. normoxia; P < 0.0001) and was progressive until 8 h
of simulated ischaemia (38% vs. normoxia; P < 0.0001). After 8 h of
simulated ischaemia, there was a 20% decrease in ApoJ-Glyc secretion when compared to the levels detected at 1 h (Figure 1B).
In contrast, no significant differences in the secretion levels of
VSMC were found. HL-1, HepG2, Stellate, and HUVEC cells released
very low levels of ApoJ-Glyc with a concentration that was below the
LOD of the assay (<7.8 ng/mL).
To further confirm the presence of ApoJ-Glyc in the medium of all
the cell types and to characterize the changes in the glycosylation
profile of secreted ApoJ, PNGase F deglycosylation analysis was carried out in concentrated protein extracts of the medium of all the

different cell types so that enough protein material was obtained to
analyse ApoJ by western blot analysis (Supplementary material
online, Figure S4A). In this analysis, the ratio of deglycosylated vs. glycosylated forms serves as an indicator of ApoJ-Glyc containing Nacetylglucosamine residues. Interestingly, simulated ischaemia, both
in PVCF and HL-1, induced a 28% decrease in the deglycosylated/glycosylated ratio, highlighting reduced glycosylation of secreted ApoJ
specifically in those cells of cardiac origin subjected to simulated ischaemic conditions (Supplementary material online, Figure S4B and
C).

The analysis of intracellular ApoJ forms (Supplementary material online, Figure S5 for representative western blot images in each cell
type) revealed an influence of simulated ischaemia in the ratio between non-glycosylated ApoJ and ApoJ-Glyc variants, specifically in
cellular types of cardiac origin (PVCF and HL-1). Both PVCF and HL1 cells subjected to 8 h simulated ischaemia (O2 deprivation and acidic conditions) depicted a shift in the abundance of non-glycosylated
ApoJ vs. ApoJ-Glyc forms when compared to 1 h of simulated ischaemia (Supplementary material online, Figure S6A and B). Hypoxia alone
did not induce these changes in intracellular ApoJ forms. The

basal levels; Figure 3A). In contrast, hs-TnI levels showed a significant
increase only after 60 min of ischaemia onset (P < 0.05 vs. basal levels;
Figure 3B), time point in which signs of irreversible cardiac damage
were evident as revealed by the detection of a significant scar in TTC
staining (Supplementary material online, Figure S3). No significant correlation was observed between ApoJ-Glyc and hs-TnI levels
(R = 0.101 P = 0.058). Three days after myocardial infarction, there
was a recovery in ApoJ-Glyc levels (Figure 3C). High-sensitivity troponin I levels showed the strongest increase 3 days after myocardial infarction with a decrease to baseline levels 2 weeks after the
intervention (Figure 3D).

revealed that the measurement of ApoJ-Glyc levels showed a high
discriminating value for the presence of myocardial ischaemia with an
area under the curve (AUC) of 0.934 (P < 0.0001) and a cut-off value
of 332 mg/mL with 97% sensitivity and 71% specificity (Figure 4B).

Multiple linear regression analysis, including those variables significantly associated with ApoJ-Glyc levels in the bivariate analysis (having an ischaemic event, sex, HDL-C, and CRP levels, and statin
treatment; Supplementary material online, Table S1), showed that the
presence of an ischaemic event remained as the only independent
factor for ApoJ-Glyc levels in a first model with an R of 0.693 and a
beta-value for unstandardized coefficients of -0.693 (P < 0.0001). In a
second model, sex was also included as an independent factor for
ApoJ-Glyc levels although with a beta-value for unstandardized coefficients of -0.139 (P = 0.017).
To further investigate ApoJ-Glyc in the clinical setting, we investigated a second independent group of patients. Specifically, ApoJ-Glyc
levels were analysed in samples taken at admission in 212 STEMI
patients (including de novo and secondary events) with different times
of evolution of the ischaemic pain that included patients with positive
hs-TnT detection at admission (group of patients with full-blown necrosis). ST-elevation myocardial infarction patients showed 15%
lower ApoJ-Glyc levels at admission when compared with the control
group (mean +/- SEM: STEMI: 402 +/- 8 vs. C: 473 +/- 6 mg/mL; P < 0.0001;
Figure 5A). C-statistics analysis revealed that the measurement of
ApoJ-Glyc levels showed a discriminating ability for the presence of
myocardial ischaemia with an AUC of 0.713 (P < 0.0001) and a cut-off
value of 409 mg/mL with 80% sensitivity and 53% specificity (Figure 5B).

Figure 5C). In this second cohort of patients, multiple linear regression
analysis including those variables significantly associated with ApoJGlyc levels in the bivariate analysis (having an ischaemic event, total
cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C, and CRP levels, and hypertension;
Supplementary material online, Table S2) also showed that the presence of an ischaemic event remained as the only independent factor
for ApoJ-Glyc levels in a first model with an R of 0.326 and a betavalue for unstandardized coefficients of -0.326 (P < 0.0001). In a
second model, total cholesterol levels were also included as an independent factor for ApoJ-Glyc levels although with a beta-value for
unstandardized coefficients of -0.199 (P = 0.001). In a third model,
CRP levels were also included as an independent factor for ApoJGlyc levels with a beta-value for unstandardized coefficients of -0.161
(P = 0.001). Nevertheless, in the three models, having an ischaemic
event remained as the best predictor of ApoJ-Glyc levels.

Glycosylated apolipoprotein J in STelevation myocardial infarction patients
after the acute event
ST-elevation myocardial infarction patients with a final TIMI flow
grade of 0 or 1, which is known to be associated to a worse prognosis
due to increased risk of mortality,24 showed significantly lower ApoJGlyc plasma levels at admission (t = 0) than those STEMI patients
with a final TIMI flow of >_2 (Figure 6A). In addition, STEMI patients
with cardiogenic shock showed 12% lower ApoJ-Glyc plasma levels
at admission (t = 0) when compared to those who did not have cardiogenic shock (P = 0.004).
In a subset of 82 STEMI patients (for whom a blood sample was
available 72 h after admission), ApoJ-Glyc levels were quantified in
plasma samples obtained 72 h after admission (Figure 6B).

Glycosylated apolipoprotein J showed, on average, a decrease with
respect to levels at admission (mean +/- SEM: t = 72 h: 331 +/- 10 vs.
t = 0: 402 +/- 8 mg/mL; P < 0.0001; Figure 6C). If changes in ApoJ-Glyc
levels were analysed individually, two different groups of patients
were defined, namely those patients showing stable ApoJ-Glyc levels
or even an increasing (recovery) trend and those showing a progressive decrease in ApoJ-Glyc levels (P < 0.0001; Figure 6D). The latter
group showed a progressive decrease in ApoJ-Glyc levels and had
higher Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) risk
score values than the group showing stable ApoJ-Glyc levels
(P = 0.03; Figure 6E).
Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis revealed that those patients
with ApoJ-Glyc levels below the median value of the STEMI group at
admission showed a higher rate of recurrent ischaemic events (nonfatal AMI, unplanned revascularization for ischaemia after discharge,
admission for heart failure or stroke) and mortality after 6 months of
follow-up (P = 0.008; Supplementary material online, Figure S8; cut-off
value median levels of STEMI patients at admission).

Discussion
Chest pain is one of the most common causes of hospital admission
worldwide and represents a major diagnostic challenge. Early triage
of patients with acute chest pain is crucial to optimize treatment and
reduce healthcare costs. The heterogeneous nature of patients presenting with acute chest pain, together with the emerging importance
of distinguishing between myocardial infarction and non-ischaemic
myocardial injury,25 has highlighted the need for the identification of
novel pathways and pathological mechanisms to characterize ischaemic damage.

Glycosylated Apo J in cardiac ischaemia

Glycosylated apolipoprotein J as an early
sensor of myocardial ischaemia
In the present study, we have demonstrated, for the first time, that
glycosylated ApoJ-Glyc forms are a specific and sensitive biomarker
of myocardial ischaemia (Graphical Abstract). In a previous discovery
study, we described a shift in the proteomic glycosylation profile of
ApoJ, also known as clusterin, in the early phase of cardiac ischaemia.15 Aberrant glycosylation has now been recognized as an attribute of many mammalian diseases, including hereditary disorders,
immune deficiencies, neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer.26 Therefore, protein glycosylation analysis has become a new approach for the discovery of novel cell damage
pathways. Indeed, recent studies have suggested a relationship between differential glycosylation states of serum proteins and specific
pathologies.27,28
Apolipoprotein J is a molecular chaperone with anti-oxidant and
cytoprotective properties.29 This apolipoprotein has different forms
with different functions according to alternatively spliced variants, the
presence of targeting sequences, the presence of disulphide bonds,
and the presence of different post-translational modifications.30 One

of the most relevant post-translational modifications in ApoJ protein
is glycosylation. There are different glycosylation states of ApoJ ranging from a partially glycosylated variant (60 kDa) to a fully glycosylated variant (75 kDa). This ability to change its glycosylation level is
related to ApoJ sensitivity to cellular perturbations, such as the ATP
and O2 deprivation and their impact on cellular metabolism typical of
ischaemia. Under normal conditions, fully ApoJ-Glyc has a functional
role as a molecular chaperone.31,32 Under oxidizing conditions, intracellular hypoglycosylated and retro-translocated ApoJ variants have
shown an enhanced activity as molecular chaperones cooperating
with other chaperones to fight against oxidative stress.32,33 In the
context of AMI, oxidative stress is precisely one of the pathophysiological concepts underlying myocardial ischaemia/reperfusion injury
contributing to oxidative damage to proteins.34,35 Our in vitro results,
using cell cultures of different origin, show that simulated ischaemic
conditions induce a shift in the glycosylation profile of ApoJ indicative
of an accumulation of intracellular non-glycosylated variants. This accumulation could be related to the previously described enhanced
chaperone activity of intracellular ApoJ variants in a highly oxidative
milieu to help in the trafficking, binding, and/or refolding of denatured

intracellular proteins in the context of ischaemia. This change is mirrored by a decrease in the secretion of ApoJ-Glyc, specifically in cells
of cardiac origin as confirmed by the proof-of-concept experiments
in differentiated cardiomyocytes from iPS cells, appearing as the potential underlying cause behind the observed decreased circulating
ApoJ-Glyc levels in patients with ischaemic events. Thus, under the
initial ischaemic insult, the cell could be secreting lower levels of the
glycosylated variant, before reaching the threshold of cell damage
that triggers the apoptosis gene program, necrosis, and Tn release.
Our results in the preclinical pig model of STEMI have demonstrated
the early decrease in the secretion of ApoJ-Glyc upon the initiation
of ischaemia that precedes, by 1 h, the release of Tn (measured
with a hs assay) into the bloodstream, highlighting a potential role as
an early biomarker of ischaemia prior to the evidence of irreversible
cell damage emerging. Importantly, ApoJ-Glyc changes were
observed even when no signs of cardiac damage were evident by
TTC (30 min post-AMI initiation).
Until now, studies analysing the potential role of ApoJ in the cardiovascular system have been based on the analysis of total protein
levels36,37 and/or animal models where ApoJ gene expression was
knocked down or over-expressed,38 being all of them scenarios in
which the potential contribution of specific ApoJ protein variants
could not be elucidated. Apolipoprotein J is represented by a series

Glycosylated Apo J in cardiac ischaemia

Limitations
A limitation of the study is that hs-TnT measurement was not available in the cohort of patients in Group 1 in which TnT levels were
measured by conventional assays (as this was the assay that was
clinically used at the time patients were included in the study) and unfortunately no blood samples were left to run the quantification of hsTnT. However, in Group 2, hs-TnT measurements were available and
we have seen that ApoJ-Glyc-reduced levels occur and are associated
with clinical outcomes even in the context of elevated hs-TnT levels
at admission. Furthermore, by using the pig model, we have been able
to compare the kinetics of the changes between ApoJ-Glyc and hsTnT. Further work is required to look at the behaviour of ApoJ-Glyc
in different conditions where non-ischaemic myocardial injury occurs
and Tn release is induced by mechanisms other than ischaemia,3,46 to
better clarify if ApoJ-Glyc decrease is specific for ischaemia.
Nevertheless, it is important to stress that, if further validated, ApoJGlyc could be useful in complementing markers of myocardial injury.
In addition, due to the low numbers and the consequent lack of
multivariable analysis, the survival analysis represents an early exploratory analysis that deserves further validation.

Conclusions and future research
We have identified, in proof-of-concept in vitro studies, in a preclinical
STEMI model and in patients with myocardial ischaemia that ApoJ-

Glyc is a promising novel sensor for the early detection of ischaemia
with potential added value regarding risk assessment post-AMI
(Graphical Abstract). Further studies are needed to test its performance in large prospective clinical validation trials in unselected
patients with possible acute myocardial ischaemia and to fully assess
its potential added value in the context of hs-Tn. Of particular importance could be the clinical value of ApoJ-Glyc in patients with suspected ACS and normal or inconclusive hs-TnT values and in the
context of other possible mechanisms of cardiac ischaemia, such as
non-obstructive coronary artery disease and functional disorders
affecting coronary blood flow.

availability of sensitive and accurate biomarkers of ischaemia might
improve current clinical risk stratification scores.43
The association between the progressive decrease in ApoJ-Glyc
levels 72 h after admission and PCI and higher GRACE risk score values, points towards a potential role of ApoJ-Glyc in mapping an ongoing ischaemic process that could have a direct impact on a patient's
prognosis. Indeed, increasing evidence has shown that in a proportion
of patients, PCI does not achieve effective myocardial reperfusion
due to the occurrence of coronary microvascular obstruction
(MVO). This has led to the notion that MVO is another important independent predictor of adverse left ventricular remodelling that
could be more predictive of major adverse cardiovascular events
than infarct size itself.44,45 In this context, having a reliable biomarker
of ischaemia able to map the evolution of the ischaemic event, irrespectively of its origin, would be very useful to guide decision-making
and treatment. In fact, our in vitro studies have revealed a timedependent decrease in the secretion of ApoJ-Glyc that was evident
as early as in 1 h and was progressive until 8 h of ischaemia, pointing
to the potential added value of ApoJ-Glyc in detecting the evolution
of the ischaemic process. Furthermore, the observed association
between decreased ApoJ-Glyc levels and the worse outcome at
6-month follow-up after STEMI highlights the potential pathophysiological role of this protein in the clinical evolution of the disease. We
have previously reported, for the first time, the association between
the glycosylated status of another apolipoprotein, apolipoprotein A-I,
and myocardial infarction.19 The added value of ApoJ-Glyc points out
to a potential role of this biomarker in the identification of high-risk
patients at the moment of admission, representing a clear advantage
in the triage of those patients with the highest need for advanced
treatment and monitoring.
