Aims

We evaluated the long-term prognostic value of invasively assessing coronary physiology after heart transplantation
in a large multicentre registry.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
Comprehensive intracoronary physiology assessment measuring fractional flow reserve (FFR), the index of microand results
circulatory resistance (IMR), and coronary flow reserve (CFR) was performed in 254 patients at baseline (a median
of 7.2 weeks) and in 240 patients at 1 year after transplantation (199 patients had both baseline and 1-year measurement). Patients were classified into those with normal physiology, reduced FFR (FFR <_ 0.80), and microvascular
dysfunction (either IMR >_ 25 or CFR <_ 2.0 with FFR > 0.80). The primary outcome was the composite of death or
re-transplantation at 10 years. At baseline, 5.5% had reduced FFR; 36.6% had microvascular dysfunction. Baseline
reduced FFR [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 2.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88-6.15; P = 0.088] and microvascular dysfunction (aHR 0.88, 95% CI 0.44-1.79; P = 0.73) were not predictors of death and re-transplantation at
10 years. At 1 year, 5.0% had reduced FFR; 23.8% had microvascular dysfunction. One-year reduced FFR (aHR 2.98,
95% CI 1.13-7.87; P = 0.028) and microvascular dysfunction (aHR 2.33, 95% CI 1.19-4.59; P = 0.015) were associated with significantly increased risk of death or re-transplantation at 10 years. Invasive measures of coronary physiology improved the prognostic performance of clinical variables (v2 improvement: 7.41, P = 0.006). However, intravascular ultrasound-derived changes in maximal intimal thickness were not predictive of outcomes.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
Abnormal coronary physiology 1 year after heart transplantation was common and was a significant predictor of
death or re-transplantation at 10 years.

Cardiac allograft vasculopathy

Introduction
Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is the leading cause of late morbidity and mortality (>_1 year) after heart transplantation.1 Cardiac
allograft vasculopathy is a panarterial disease with a progressive and
diffuse process involving both the epicardial coronary artery and the
microcirculation. Approximately 10% of patients have angiographic
coronary artery disease at 1 year, 50% at 5 years, and 80% at 15 years,
with long-term mortality increasing with angiographic severity.2
Cardiac allograft vasculopathy can also manifest as a microvasculopathy, which occurs more frequently than epicardial coronary artery
stenosis at 1 year after transplantation and is associated with a higher
risk of cardiac events, independent of epicardial coronary artery
stenosis.3
Clinical guidelines recommend annual or biannual coronary angiography to assess the development of CAV.4 Intravascular ultrasound
(IVUS) is often used to more accurately detect progression of CAV
that is not readily apparent with coronary angiography.5 However,
anatomical evaluation is limited to assessing the physiological consequences of epicardial coronary artery disease and is not able to assess
microvascular dysfunction. In addition, the presence of epicardial

CAV does not necessarily indicate that microvascular dysfunction is
present and vice versa.6,7
Assessing coronary physiology using a pressure-temperature sensor-tipped guidewire has been well validated in non-transplant
patients.8 The comprehensive physiological assessment of the epicardial coronary artery and microcirculation has helped to characterize
the physiological phenotype of patients and to better predict their
prognosis.9,10 Similarly, in transplant patients, fractional flow reserve
(FFR) correlates with plaque volume assessed by IVUS, and the index
of microcirculatory resistance (IMR) measured after transplantation
has been shown to predict the development of CAV, poor graft function, and long-term mortality in single-centre studies.11,12 The prognostic value of invasively assessing coronary physiology early after
heart transplantation has not been adequately validated in a large
multicentre study.
This international multicentre registry enrolled heart transplant
recipients who underwent a comprehensive intracoronary physiology assessment at baseline and 1 year after transplantation. We
then characterized the coronary physiological abnormality into abnormal epicardial coronary physiology and/or microvascular dysfunction and evaluated their long-term prognostic value.

Methods
Study population

Immunosuppressive therapy and
surveillance endomyocardial biopsy
All patients received standard immunosuppressive therapy according to
the clinical protocol of each participating centre.13-15,18-20 Briefly,
patients received induction therapy with antithymocyte globulin, daclizumab, or basiliximab. Maintenance immunosuppression was based on calcineurin inhibitors (cyclosporin or tacrolimus), antimetabolites
(azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil), and prednisone, which was
tapered during the first year at some centres. Calcineurin inhibitors were
partially or completely replaced with mammalian target of rapamycin
inhibitors (everolimus or sirolimus) in selected patients according to the
clinical status or protocol. Therapeutic levels of immunosuppressive
agents and associated side effects were carefully monitored and titrated
accordingly. Concomitant medications including statins and, in some
cases, aspirin were initiated as soon as the patient was able to comply
with oral intake. As part of standard clinical care, patients were monitored for the occurrence of acute cellular rejection by endomyocardial
biopsies performed at the standard interval according to the clinical
protocol of each participating centre and at the time of any suspected episode of rejection. Specimens were graded with respect to rejection by
each centre's pathologist according to the criteria of the International
Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) 2004 version.21

Intracoronary physiological assessment
At baseline and at 1 year after successful heart transplantation, intracoronary physiological assessment was performed in conjunction with a coronary angiogram and intravascular imaging.4 After performance of
coronary angiography, FFR, IMR, and CFR were measured in the usual
fashion with a pressure-temperature sensor-tipped guidewire (Abbott
Vascular) placed in the distal two-third of the left anterior descending artery.12,18 Fractional flow reserve was defined as the mean distal coronary
pressure divided by the mean aortic pressure at maximal hyperaemia.
Index of microcirculatory resistance was calculated as the distal coronary
pressure at maximal hyperaemia divided by the inverse of hyperaemic
mean transit time.22 Coronary flow reserve was calculated as resting
mean transit time divided by hyperaemic mean transit time. Resting and
hyperaemic mean transit time were measured using standard thermodilution techniques.23 Maximal hyperaemia was induced with intravenous adenosine at 140 lg/kg/min through a central vein or large antecubital vein.

Definition of physiological abnormality
According to intracoronary physiology assessment, the study population
was classified into three categories: normal coronary physiology, reduced
FFR, and microvascular dysfunction. Patients with reduced FFR were
defined as those having an FFR <_0.80 regardless of IMR and CFR values.24
Microvascular dysfunction was defined according to standardized
COVADIS (Coronary Vasomotion Disorders International Study Group)

diagnostic criteria: IMR >_25 or CFR <_2.0 in the absence of significant epicardial disease (FFR > 0.80).25 In addition, sustained abnormal physiology
was defined when coronary physiology was abnormal at baseline and at
1 year, and newly developed abnormal physiology was defined when coronary physiology was normal at baseline and abnormal at 1 year.

Coronary angiography and intravascular
ultrasound assessment
The angiographic severity of CAV after transplantation was evaluated by
ISHLT classification based on 1-year coronary angiography.5 ISHLTCAV0 indicates no detectable angiographic lesion; ISHLT-CAV1 (mild)
indicates angiographic left main <50%, or primary vessel with a maximum
lesion of <70%, or any branch stenosis <70% (including diffuse narrowing) without allograft dysfunction; ISHLT-CAV2 (moderate) indicates
angiographic left main <50%, a single primary vessel >_70%, or isolated
branch stenosis >_70% in branches of two systems, without allograft dysfunction; and ISHLT-CAV3 (severe) indicates angiographic left main
>_50%, or two or more primary vessels with >_70% stenosis, or isolated
branch stenosis >_70% in all three systems, or ISHLT-CAV1 or ISHLTCAV2 with allograft dysfunction.
Intravascular ultrasound was performed in the left anterior descending
artery with a 20 MHz (Volcano Corporation Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) or
40 MHz IVUS catheter (Boston Scientific, Natick, MA, USA) and an automatic pullback at 0.5 mm/s. Offline IVUS analyses (EchoPlaque, Indec
Systems, Santa Clara, CA, USA) were performed in the IVUS core laboratory of individual participating centres according to the American College
of Cardiology clinical expert consensus document.26 Maximal intimal
thickness (MIT) at baseline and at 1 year and the change in MIT was measured. An increase of >_0.5 mm in MIT within 1 year after transplantation
was considered as the rapid progression group.27,28

Outcomes
The primary outcome of this study was the composite of death from any
cause or re-heart transplantation. A major secondary outcome was the
rate of major adverse cardiac events (MACE), the composite of death
from any cause, re-heart transplantation, myocardial infarction defined by
ischaemic symptoms and signs with cardiac enzyme elevation more than
the upper reference limit, coronary revascularization including percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary bypass surgery, stroke, graft dysfunction defined by newly developed left ventricular dysfunction (ejection
fraction <_45%), or readmission due to a cardiac cause. Patients were censored at 10 years or when an event occurred.

Data collection and follow-up
Individual patient data from each study were sent to the study coordinating committee at Stanford University and merged for analysis. The pooled
database was checked for completeness and consistency. Patients were
followed until May of 2020. The independent ethics committee for each
centre/country approved each study protocol.

Statistical analysis
Continuous variables are expressed as mean +/- standard deviation or median with interquartile range; categorical variables are shown as counts
and percentages. Continuous variables were compared using one-way
analysis of variance; categorical variables were compared using v2 statistics or Fisher's exact test. Paired samples were compared using
Wilcoxon test or McNemar test. Time-to-event data are presented as
Kaplan-Meier estimates. The multivariable Cox regression model was
used to identify statistically significant predictors and potential confounders for the primary outcome. In addition, the treatment effect was

Patients were pooled from five prospective cohorts [three prospective
randomized trials and two prospective observational studies conducted
in four countries (USA, Norway, Sweden, and Korea)].13-17 The study design, detailed entry criteria of each study, and the key features are summarized in Supplementary material online, Table S1 and Figure S1. For this
analysis, only patients evaluated by comprehensive coronary physiological
assessment including FFR, IMR, and coronary flow reserve (CFR) at baseline and/or at 1 year after transplantation were included.

Coronary physiology after transplantation

Results
Baseline characteristics
Comprehensive intracoronary physiological evaluation for epicardial
coronary artery and coronary microcirculation using FFR, IMR, and
CFR were performed in 254 patients at baseline [7.2 weeks (Q1-Q3,
4.1-10.3) after transplantation] and in 240 patients at 1 year [1.0 year
(Q1-Q3, 0.99-1.01)]. Of those, 199 patients had both baseline and
1-year measurement (Figure 1 and Supplementary material online,
Figure S1). Overall, the recipient mean age was 50.3 +/- 12.7 years with
72.5% male sex. The donor mean age was 36.8 +/- 13.8 years with
70.8% male sex. Most patients were Caucasian (86.3%), with 3.3%
Asian and 6.3% Black. Sex, blood type, and cytomegalovirus IgG mismatch occurred in 29.2%, 2.1%, and 20.8%, respectively. All patients
received standard induction and maintenance immunosuppressive
therapy. Patient characteristics are summarized in Table 1.

Changes in coronary physiology
Supplementary material online, Figure S2 depicts the changes in individual physiology indices from baseline to 1 year after transplantation. Fractional flow reserve value did not change significantly
[0.92 (Q1-Q3, 0.88-0.94) at baseline to 0.91 (Q1-Q3, 0.86-0.95)
at 1 year, P = 0.45]. However, IMR decreased significantly from a
median of 16.0 (Q1-Q3, 11.3-22.8) to a median of 13.7 (Q1-Q3,
10.1-19.6) (P = 0.001) and CFR increased significantly from a median of 3.1 (Q1-Q3, 2.0-4.1) to a median of 3.7 (Q1-Q3, 2.5-
5.2) (P < 0.001).
Regarding the physiology phenotype, 5.5% of patients had reduced
FFR and 36.6% of patients had microvascular dysfunction at baseline;
5.0% of patients had reduced FFR and 23.8% of patients had microvascular dysfunction at 1 year (Figure 1). The incidence of patients
with reduced FFR was not significantly changed (P = 0.79) from baseline to 1 year after transplantation while the incidence of those with
microvascular dysfunction was significantly decreased (P = 0.002)
(Figure 1). Smoking status and donor age were significantly associated
with microvascular dysfunction (Supplementary material online,
Table S2).

Clinical outcomes and coronary
physiology
At 10 years, the primary outcome of the composite of death from
any cause or re-transplantation occurred in 44 patients (40 deaths
from any cause, and 4 re-transplantations). In addition, coronary
revascularization occurred in 8 patients, stroke in 6 patients, graft
dysfunction in 25 patients and readmission in 54 patients among the
cohort with physiology evaluation at 1 year (Supplementary material
online, Table S3).
At baseline physiological assessment, reduced FFR was not associated with a higher risk of death or re-transplantation [adjusted hazard
ratio (aHR) 2.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88-6.15; P = 0.088]
and MACE (aHR 1.69, 95% CI 0.77-3.71; P = 0.19) at 10 years. In addition, microvascular dysfunction at baseline was not associated with
the higher risk of death or re-transplantation (aHR 0.88, 95% CI
0.44-1.79; P = 0.73) and MACE (aHR 0.88, 95% CI 0.54-1.41;
P = 0.58) at 10 years (Table 2, Figure 2, and Supplementary material
online, Table S4).
At 1-year assessment, reduced FFR was significantly associated
with an increased risk of death or re-transplantation (aHR 2.98, 95%
CI 1.13-7.87; P = 0.028) but was not associated with the risk of
MACE (aHR 1.90, 95% CI 0.68-5.34; P = 0.22). Microvascular dysfunction was significantly associated with both the risk of death or retransplantation (aHR 2.33, 95% CI 1.19-4.59; P = 0.015) and the risk
of MACE (aHR 2.52, 95% CI 1.45-4.35; P < 0.001) (Table 2, Figure 2,
and Supplementary material online, Table S4). Additional analysis
using time-varying Cox proportional model using physiology study at
1 year as time-varying covariate showed consistent results
(Supplementary material online, Table S5). Sustained abnormal epicardial coronary physiology (reduced FFR) between baseline and
1 year (aHR 11.4, 95% CI 1.68-77.4; P = 0.013), and newly developed
microvascular dysfunction after baseline assessment (aHR, 7.12, 95%
CI 2.53-20.0; P < 0.001) (Table 2 and Figure 3) contributed significantly to the prognostic value of the coronary physiological assessment.
Adding comprehensive invasive measures of coronary physiology
into the model including only clinical variables improved the prognostic performance to predict death and re-transplantation and MACE
at 10 years (Table 3 and Supplementary material online, Table S6).
Supplementary material online, Table S7 demonstrates the prognostic value of individual physiology indices. Coronary flow reserve
<_2.0 at 1 year (aHR 2.32, 95% CI 1.10-4.89; P = 0.027) was significantly associated with the risk of death and re-transplantation at
10 years while IMR >_25 at 1 year was significantly associated with the
risk of MACE at 10 years (aHR 2.13, 95% CI 1.20-3.76; P = 0.009).
FFR <_0.80 did not show a significant worse outcome compare with
FFR >0.80 which included normal physiology and microvascular
dysfunction.

Prognostic value of coronary
angiography and intravascular
ultrasound parameter
In our cohort (N = 240) who underwent coronary physiology measurement at 1 year, angiographically detected ISHLT-CAV occurred in
35 patients (14.6%): 29 (12.1%) had ISHLT-CAV1, and 6 (2.5%) had
ISHLT-CAV2, while most patients (N = 203, 84.6%) had no angiographic evidence of CAV and no patients had ISHLT-CAV3. The

estimated separately for each study, and the estimates were combined to
provide an overall estimate of the treatment effect using a stratified Cox
regression analysis. Variables listed in Table 1 were selected by the backward elimination methods and those with a significant association with
death from any cause and MACE were entered into the final model. To
evaluate the prognostic value of physiology study at 1 year, patients who
experienced clinical events before the physiology study at 1 year were
censored in the multivariable model. In addition, a time-varying Cox proportional model using the physiology study at 1 year as time-varying covariate was performed. The proportional hazards assumption was tested
using Schoenfeld residuals. A nested Cox proportional hazard regression
analysis was used to investigate the incremental prognostic value of physiology abnormality. The cut-off value of coronary physiology indices was
additionally assessed by time-dependent receiver operating characteristic
curve analyses. Statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS version
21.0 software (IBM, Chicago, IL, USA) and R software version 3.5.1 (R
Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). All applicable Pvalues were two-sided, and a P-value of <0.05 was considered statistically
significant.

Coronary physiology after transplantation

Discussion
This is the largest cohort to date studying the prognostic value of
intracoronary physiology assessment in cardiac transplant recipients. The primary finding of this international multicentre registry
is that either abnormal epicardial coronary physiology or microvascular dysfunction is common, occurring in 42.1% at baseline
and 28.8% at 1 year after cardiac transplantation and both abnormal epicardial coronary physiology and microvascular dysfunction
at 1 year were significant predictors of the composite of death or
re-transplantation at 10-year follow-up (Graphial Abstract). This
study suggests that for the management of the heart transplant recipient, a comprehensive intracoronary physiology assessment has
an important clinical role in characterizing the patient's physiological phenotype and predicting long-term outcomes and, thus, should
be considered as a routine monitoring strategy for CAV. Key questions that remain are how a clinician should respond to these abnormal phenotypes and whether adjunctive therapy will prevent
future adverse events.
This study confirms a previous pathological study on the prognostic value of microvascular dysfunction using comprehensive physiological assessment in a larger multicentre population.3,10
Microvascular dysfunction occurred more frequently than abnormal
epicardial coronary physiology and had contrasting temporal trends
in its incidence and prognostic value. Early after transplantation,
39.2% of patients had microvascular dysfunction, which decreased
significantly by 1 year to 29.2% of patients. The prognostic value of
microvascular dysfunction at baseline was not significant while microvascular dysfunction at 1 year was strongly associated with the 10year risk of death or re-transplantation; this was mostly a result of
newly developed microvascular dysfunction. These findings suggest
different underlying mechanisms of microvascular dysfunction
according to the post-transplantation period. Early after

transplantation, microvascular dysfunction is likely to be associated
with post-operative changes, reperfusion injury, or an early immunological or inflammatory reaction, which are presumed to be temporary and reversible, and, thus, unlikely to mediate long-term
outcomes. Microvascular dysfunction at 1 year is likely due to structural changes or overt functional deterioration.3,18 The incidence of
pathological microvasculopathy significantly increased during the 1year post-transplantation period3 and microvascular dysfunction at
1 year has been shown to be associated with impaired ventricular
function, a decrease in cardiac index and stroke volume index, and
more haemodynamically compromising rejection.18 Therefore,
microvascular dysfunction at 1 year could be considered as a clinically
relevant surrogate marker for long-term survival after heart transplantation and a potential therapeutic target for medical management, although this needs to be validated in further studies.14,29
Currently, there are no standard criteria for detecting microvascular dysfunction after heart transplantation although CFR and IMR
measured with a coronary wire in the catheterization laboratory are
the best studied. In this study, we defined microvascular dysfunction
as either IMR >_25 or CFR <_2.0 in the absence of significant epicardial
coronary stenosis (FFR > 0.80) according to COVADIS diagnostic
criteria.25 Coronary flow reserve is a dynamic test to evaluate the
coronary vasodilatory capacity, defined as hyperaemic coronary
blood flow divided by resting flow, and represents the ability of the

presence of any ISHLT-CAV (>_ISHLT-CAV1) was significantly associated with a higher risk of the composite of death or retransplantation (aHR 4.34, 95% CI 1.29-14.6; P = 0.018) and MACE
(aHR 2.58, 95% CI 1.05-6.31; P = 0.039) at 10 years. Nevertheless,
the presence of microvascular dysfunction at 1 year was significantly
associated with the composite of death or re-transplantation (aHR
2.16, 95% CI 1.09-4.30; P = 0.028) and MACE (aHR 2.10, 95% CI
1.12-3.34; P = 0.008) even after adjusting for angiographic severity of
CAV. In addition, adding coronary physiology assessment improved
the prognostic performance of the model including clinical variables
plus angiographic severity of CAV (Supplementary material online,
Table S8).
In our cohort, 206 patients underwent serial IVUS analysis at baseline and at 1 year. An increase of >_0.5 mm in MIT from baseline to
1 year after transplantation was observed in 10 (4.9%) patients and
was not associated with long-term risk of death and retransplantation [hazard ratio (HR) 1.09, 95% CI 0.26-4.55; P = 0.91].
The prognostic significance of reduced FFR (HR 2.53, 95% CI 1.24-
5.18; P = 0.011) and microvascular dysfunction (HR 4.43, 95% CI
1.52-13.0; P = 0.007) compared with normal physiology was maintained even after putting an increase of >_0.5 mm in MIT into the multivariable model.

microcirculation to appropriately increase myocardial blood flow. It
is important to recognize that CFR interrogates the entire coronary
circulation, both the epicardial vessel and the microvasculature, so an
abnormal value can be indicative of abnormal physiology in either location. In addition, an abnormal CFR may occur due to increased
resting flow, with a normal hyperaemic flow. This has been suggested
as a specific endotype of microvascular dysfunction, which cannot be
detected by measuring IMR alone. Index of microcirculatory resistance measures the minimum achievable coronary microvascular resistance during hyperaemia. Because it is measured during
hyperaemia, it is less dependent on haemodynamic changes and
more reproducible than CFR,30 which incorporates resting flow into
its equation. Previous studies showed that both IMR11,12 and
CFR31,32 were associated with the progression of CAV and
decreased long-term survival after transplantation, although there
were conflicting results.33,34 In this study, CFR <_2.0 was associated
with a higher risk of death and re-transplantation at 10 years and IMR
>_25 at baseline and at 1 year were associated with a higher risk of
MACE at 10 years.
Abnormal epicardial coronary physiology assessed by FFR <_0.80
was associated with 10-year mortality or re-transplantation in this
study. However, an increase of >_0.5 mm in MIT based on serial IVUS
was not. This could be explained by the low incidence of rapid progression of MIT: 4.9% in our study compared with 29.1% in previous
studies,27,28 probably due to more extensive use of statin therapy
and advances in immunosuppressive therapy. In addition, the diffuse

nature of CAV can lead to a significant decline in myocardial perfusion pressure without a remarkable increase in MIT in a single plane
measurement.35 Finally, negative vascular remodelling, without intimal thickening can lead to a decrease in FFR.36 Physicians should be
aware that microvascular dysfunction after transplantation can attenuate hyperaemia, resulting in higher FFR values. Nevertheless, FFR
continues to provide information about the impact of an epicardial
stenosis on the percentage of maximum achievable myocardial flow.
A previous study found that microvascular dysfunction improved
during the first year after transplantation, and worsened again thereafter.35 In addition, simultaneous evaluation with microvascular function using IMR and CFR helps to interpret FFR more appropriately in
heart transplant recipients.
There is some controversy about the prognostic significance of
donor transmitted atherosclerosis. A previous study suggested that
donor lesions do not accelerate plaque progression early after transplantation.37 However, volumetric IVUS analysis demonstrated a significant association between donor transmitted atherosclerosis and
worsening of CAV.38,39 Similarly, this study shows the prognostic
value of donor transmitted atherosclerosis based on functional significance for predicting the risk of death or re-transplantation at
10 years, particularly when it is sustained during the first year after
transplantation.
This study has several limitations. First, this is a post hoc analysis of
prospectively collected data. Second, given the wide CIs for the estimate of effect, the findings do not allow for a conclusive

interpretation, although this is the largest study to evaluate the prognostic value of coronary physiology measurements in heart transplant
recipients. Third, coronary physiology and IVUS evaluations were
performed only in the left anterior descending artery from a selected
population. Fourth, the lack of a uniform immunosuppressive regimen partially due to long enrolment period could have affected the
results. Fifth, endothelium-dependent epicardial and microvascular
dysfunction was not evaluated and may also be an important physiological predictor of outcomes.11 Sixth, because of the invasive study
protocol performing intracoronary physiology assessment both at
baseline and at 1 year, unstable patients were not included. Seventh,
we had few patients with very low FFR compared with some earlier
studies. It may be that more recent improvements in medical management after heart transplantation have led to less CAV and higher
FFR values. Finally, this study included three randomized clinical trials.
Study randomization may have affected our results.
In conclusion, coronary physiological abnormalities at 1 year after
heart transplantation are common and are significant predictors of
death and re-transplantation at 10 years. Therefore, invasively assessing coronary physiology may help identify heart transplant recipients
at high risk for future adverse events who may benefit from close
follow-up and individualized medical therapy. However, it should be
taken into consideration that the diagnostic criteria for physiology
abnormalities used in this study were derived from patients with
non-transplant heart disease and further study to determine the optimal cut-off values of each physiology index in the heart transplantation population will be necessary.

A 72-year-old man with a history of hyperlipidaemia and palpitations presented for
ablation of supraventricular tachycardia.
He also had a history of right knee replacement, two shoulder surgeries, and bilateral
carpal tunnel syndrome. In the electrophysiology laboratory, severe (2 cm) concentric left ventricular hypertrophy was
noted on intracardiac echocardiography.
After the procedure, he underwent a cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR),
which revealed prominent thickening of
the interventricular septum and spontaneous intramyocardial haemorrhage (IMH)
[four-chamber cine and late gadolinium
enhancement (LGE) with phase-sensitive
inversion recovery (PSIR) (baseline) (white
arrows)]. In native T1 images, brighter
signals were present in the haemorrhage because gadolinium had not reached the area (black arrows). In the post-contrast T1 images, the
haemorrhage core areas remained very high signal. CMR also showed extensive global LGE which suggested amyloid infiltration. He underwent a repeat CMR 1 week later that showed an evolving septal haematoma which had decreased in size (FU1) (second row). Follow-up
CMRs at 6 weeks (FU2; third row) and 10 weeks (FU3; bottom row) documented the near resolution of intramyocardial haemorrhage.
The patient remained stable without symptoms and had a diagnostic work up which included a normal serum/urine protein electrophoresis, a positive fat pad biopsy for amyloid, a positive pyrophosphate nuclear scan, and a wild-type transthyretin (TTR) gene. He was initiated
on tafamadis after the diagnosis of wild-type ATTR cardiac amyloidosis was made.
Spontaneous intramyocardial haemorrhage is rare and one of the possible mechanisms of IMH is amyloid deposition in the vessel wall
which could lead to increased vessel fragility.
