Aims

The aim of this study was to provide population-based data on maternal and neonatal complications and outcome
in the pregnancies of women with congenital heart disease (CHD).

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
Based on administrative data from one of the largest German Health Insurance Companies (BARMER GEK, 9 miland results
lion members representative for Germany), all pregnancies in women with CHD between 2005 and 2018 were
analysed. In addition, an age-matched non-CHD control group was included for comparison and the association between adult CHD (ACHD) and maternal or neonatal outcomes investigated. Overall, 7512 pregnancies occurred
in 4015 women with CHD. The matched non-CHD control group included 6502 women with 11 225 pregnancies.
Caesarean deliveries were more common in CHD patients (40.5% vs. 31.5% in the control group; P < 0.001).
There was no excess mortality. Although the maternal complication rate was low in absolute terms, women with
CHD had a significantly higher rate of stroke, heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias during pregnancy (P < 0.001 for
all). Neonatal mortality was low but also significantly higher in the ACHD group (0.83% vs. 0.22%; P = 0.001) and
neonates to CHD mothers had low/extremely low birth weight or extreme immaturity (<0.001) or required resuscitation and mechanical ventilation more often compared to non-CHD offspring (P < 0.001 for both). On multivariate logistic regression maternal defect complexity, arterial hypertension, heart failure, prior fertility treatment,
and anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists emerged as significant predictors of adverse neonatal outcome
(P < 0.05 for all). Recurrence of CHD was 6.1 times higher in infants to ACHD mothers compared to controls
(P < 0.0001).

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusions
This population-based study illustrates a reassuringly low maternal mortality rate in a highly developed healthcare

system. Nevertheless, maternal morbidity and neonatal morbidity/mortality were significantly increased in women
with ACHD and their offspring compared to non-ACHD controls highlighting the need of specialized care and
pre-pregnancy counselling.

Overview over the main findings of the study. The results illustrate significantly increased risk of maternal and neonatal complications as well as a significantly increased risk of recurrence of congenital heart disease in the children of congenital heart disease mothers. For details, please see Tables 1-4.

Methods
This was a retrospective analysis based on administrative data from the
BARMER GEK German Health Insurance Company. The BARMER
insures 9 million members (i.e. around 1/9 of the German population of
83 million in 2018). All out- and inpatient procedures and diagnoses
occurring between 2005 and 2018 in the insured population are routinely
coded in the BARMER database for reimbursement purposes and were
available in an anonymized manner for our analysis. The dataset is complete, and its integrity and representativeness for Germany's population
have been demonstrated.17 To compare pregnancy outcomes in ACHD
patients with women without CHD, an age-matched cohort of women
under observation was also included. Patients with CHD were identified
based on the German modification of ICD-10 codes (Q20-26; for
detailed codes and additional information on classification of disease complexity, see Supplementary material online, Appendix Table SA). We
included all ACHD women who were between 10 and 55 years old during the study period. Women with an isolated atrial septal defect were
excluded as this defect shares an ICD code with patent foramen ovale in
the German ICD-10 system. Pregnancies were identified based on a panel
of pregnancy-specific ICD and inpatient procedural codes [German OPS
(operational and procedural system)] as well as reimbursement codes
used exclusively by office-based physicians. With a similar system of
codes (see Supplementary material online, Appendix for details),

.. miscarriages, abortions, complications, and the mode of delivery were
..
.. recorded. Neonates were linked to the mother via a joint identification
.. number and the frequency of neonatal complications, resuscitation, mor..
.. tality, and recurrence of CHD was evaluated. To validate the recurrence
.. rates of CHD and account for possible forward carrying of a congenital
..
.. code from the mother to the neonate, the rate of cardiac specific opera.. tions/interventions in newborns were also assessed. The study was
..
.. approved by the relevant Ethics committee as part of the overarching re.. search project using anonymized administrative health insurance data
..
.. (OptAHF project).
..
..
.. Patient and public involvement
.. No particular patient involvement was sought for this specific research
.. question. However, this project forms part of a larger group of CHD
..
.. analyses and patients as well as the broader public are continuously
.. involved in choosing and prioritizing projects relevant to CHD within the
..
.. framework of the National Register for Congenital Heart Disease.
..
..
.. Statistical analysis
.. Categorical variables are presented as number and percentages, while
..
.. continuous variables are shown as mean +/- standard deviation or median
.. and interquartile ranges, respectively. Differences between groups are
..
.. assessed by Man-Whitney U test or v2 tests depending on data type. The
.. association between maternal baseline characteristics and neonatal ad..
.. verse outcome was evaluated using uni- and multivariable mixed effect lo.. gistic regression analyses and odds rations (OR) are presented. The
.. regression models include a random intercept to account for the cluster..
.. ing of the data, i.e. mothers contributing multiple births to the analysis.
.. Model selection was carried out with backward stepwise regression
..
.. methods based on the Akaike information criterion. A two-sided P-value
.. of <0.05 was considered significant throughout the study.
..
..
..
..
.. Results
..
.. Overall, 25 585 women with ACHD between the age of 10 and 55-
..
.. included in the database during the study period-formed the basis
.. of the analysis. Of these, 4015 had at least one pregnancy between
..
.. 2005 and 2018. In addition, an age-matched cohort of 50 813 women
..
.. without CHD was identified and served as a control group. In this
.. non-CHD group, 6502 women became pregnant at least once during
..
.. the observation period. Overall, 7512 pregnancies were observed in
.. the ACHD group and 11 225 pregnancies in the non-CHD group. Of
..
.. the 7512 pregnancies in the ACHD group, 4663 (62.1%) led to deliv.. ery, 2592 (34.5%) to miscarriage/abortion and in 257 cases (3.4%)
..
.. the outcome could not be determined (e.g. because the health insur..
.. ance contract was terminated during pregnancy). The majority of
.. non-completed pregnancies were due to miscarriages/spontaneous
..
.. abortions (n = 1879; 72.5%), while 713 (27.5%) were terminated
.. medically. The rate of miscarriage/abortion was slightly but signifi..
.. cantly higher in the ACHD cohort compared to the non-CHD co.. hort (34.5% vs. 31.0%; P < 0.001). Age at pregnancy in the congenital
..
.. cohort was 30.5 +/- 6.5 years, with 13 (0.17%) of women being
..
.. <_14 years, 53 (0.71%) 15-16 years of age and 146 (1.96%) 17-
.. 18 years of age at the onset of pregnancy.
..
The vast majority of ACHD deliveries occurred in hospital
..
.. (n = 4642; 99.5%), which was similar to the non-CHD control group
..
. (n = 6623 of total 6686 deliveries, 99.1%).

This is in part due to the fact that in Western countries CHD has
now become one of the leading causes of maternal mortality.4-7
Commendable international efforts, including large-scale multicentre
registries, have provided important information regarding maternal
risk and have led to the development of risk scores for quantifying especially maternal complication rates.8-11 In addition, major tertiary
centres have contributed their extensive experience in providing specialized care for pregnant CHD patients to the literature.6,11,12
However, most of these reports are prone to selection bias and very
limited data are still available on a population-based level.13 In addition, the risks to mother and child cannot be seen in isolation of the
healthcare system involved. In resource-rich, contemporary healthcare systems, it is expected that more selected CHD women with
lower-risk profiles will proceed to pregnancy and this should alter
outcomes across the spectrum of CHD. In largely decentralized
health systems as in Germany or the USA, CHD women of reproductive age will be jointly managed by paediatric cardiologists, adult
cardiologists, gynaecologists, general practitioners, and regional and
supra-regional adult CHD (ACHD) centres. As a consequence, risk
profiles described in the literature originating from heterogeneous
geographies (including developing countries) or highly centralized
health systems (such as the English NHS) will not necessarily reflect
the outcomes and risk factors observed across the spectrum of disease in devolved community-based and decentralized settings with
established ACHD accreditation and large ACHD programmes.14-16
Using administrative data from one of Germany's largest health insurance companies, covering over 9 million members representative
for the country's population and a time period of more than a decade, we aimed to provide contemporary population-based data on
maternal and neonatal complications and outcome, quantify maternal
and neonatal risk, and investigate potential predictors of maternal or
neonatal outcome specifically in women linked to the healthcare
system.

ACHD, adult congenital heart disease; CHD, congenital heart disease; TGA, transposition of the great arteries; UVH, univentricular heart.

The pregnancy rate per patient under follow-up was slightly higher
in the ACHD cohort compared to the non-CHD cohort (0.29 vs.
0.22 pregnancies per patient, P < 0.001). Within the ACHD group,
the highest frequency of pregnancies per patient was observed in
patients with complex heart disease (0.46 pregnancies per patient),
compared to 0.32 and 0.27 in the moderate complexity and simple
complexity group (P < 0.001). Considering various maternal diagnoses, the lowest pregnancy rate overall was observed in patients
with Eisenmenger syndrome (13%). Overall, 21 successful
deliveries were recorded for 14 Eisenmenger mothers (maternal
age 28.5 +/- 5.6 years) at a median of 38.4 weeks of gestation.
Characterizing these patients further showed that all but two
Eisenmenger patients had an isolated ventricular septal defect as an
underlying lesion and none of the patients were treated with specific
pulmonary hypertension drugs before pregnancy. In the complex disease group, the rate of complications leading to abortion was lowest
in the transposition of the great arteries group (17.8% loss of pregnancy due to complications), compared to 32.8% in women with univentricular heart, 22.9% in Eisenmenger syndrome, and 20.0% in
complex uncorrected CHD, respectively. Table 1 illustrates mode
and outcome of delivery by complexity group, showing that ACHD
patients had a higher proportion of caesarean deliveries (40.5% vs.
31.5% in the non-congenital group, P < 0.001). Caesarean section
rate increased with ACHD disease complexity group of the mother
(caesarean in simple/moderate and complex heart defect groups:
39.3/42.1/44.8%, respectively; P = 0.031).
No maternal death was observed during pregnancy and up to
90 days post-delivery in the ACHD group and one woman died in
the non-ACHD group. Maternal complications tended to be higher
in ACHD patients compared to the non-CHD control group.
Statistical significance for the difference was only reached for cerebral
ischaemia (see Table 2 and Graphical Abstract). The stroke rate was
9.8 times higher for patients with moderate defect complexity and
6.6 times higher for those with high complexity compared to nonCHD controls (P < 0.001 for both). A co-existent atrial septal defect

(ICD-10 code Q21.1), a history of arrhythmias, and anticoagulation
with vitamin K antagonists or antithrombotic drug treatment (probably reflecting risk factors and prosthetic valves) were significantly
related to the risk of stroke in our population (P > 0.05 for all; for
details see Supplementary material online, Table SG). To further assess maternal morbidity during pregnancy, the incidence of heart failure admissions during pregnancy or new prescription of loop
diuretics during pregnancy was assessed (Supplementary material online, Appendix Table SC). Patients who experienced similar episodes in
the year preceding pregnancy were excluded. Although low in absolute terms, compared to non-ACHD pregnancies, the rate of heart
failure admission/new prescription of diuretics was significantly higher
in ACHD patients during pregnancy (0.84% vs. 0.03%, P < 0.001).
Similarly, assessing only hospitalization, ACHD patients had a significantly higher rate of heart failure-related admissions compared to
non-ACHD women (0.69% vs. 0.02%, P < 0.001). The complication
rates during pregnancy increased in line with increasing ACHD complexity (simple/moderate and complex heart defect groups: 0.48%,
0.94% and 2.84%, respectively). Similarly, pregnant ACHD patients
had a higher rate of arrhythmia-related complications during pregnancy (0.82% vs. 0.12%, P < 0.001). Within the ACHD group, patients
with moderate and complex heart defects had higher arrhythmia
rates (1.46% and 1.32%, respectively) compared to simple defect
patients (0.54%).
Overall, the percentage of stillbirths was significantly higher in
ACHD patients compared to the non-congenital cohort (1.4% vs.
0.4%, P < 0.001). Patients with simple defects had a stillbirth rate of
0.7%, those with moderate complexity defects of 2.2% and ACHD
patients with severe complexity defects of 4.2%. Among those with
high complexity, patients with univentricular hearts exhibited a stillbirth rate of 8.2% (P < 0.001 vs. non-congenital controls). Among the
live births, the percentage of twins was not significantly different in
ACHD compared to non-congenital women (1.66% vs. 1.61%,
P = 0.82).

ACHD, adult congenital heart disease; ECS, extracorporeal circulatory support. *Comparison between ACHD and non-congenital group.

Overall, in 85.7% of deliveries (3906 ACHD and 5745 non-ACHD
deliveries), the neonate could be linked to the mother using the
unique identification number provided. In neonates born to ACHD
mothers, infant mortality was significantly higher compared to controls. Infant mortality in the first week (first month) of life was 0.5%
(0.83%) in neonates to ACHD mothers, compared to 0.19% (0.22%)
in neonates from non-ACHD women (P = 0.004 and P < 0.001, respectively). Table 3 illustrates that neonates of ACHD mothers had
significantly more prematurity, low birth weight, and extremely low
birth weight compared to neonates of non-ACHD mothers.
Furthermore, these neonates had higher morbidity rates and
required more intensive care treatment including mechanical ventilation and mechanical circulatory support.
Comparisons between major visible abnormalities in neonates to
ACHD and non-ACHD mothers are presented in Table 4. This

presented in the online supplement) was employed to this end. On
multivariate analysis including various potential risk factors, heart defect complexity, arterial hypertension, treatment with vitamin K
antagonists in the year before pregnancy, as well as fertility treatment
preceding pregnancy emerged as significant adverse predictors of
outcome (Figure 1). Further multivariate analyses revealed an association between pre-pregnancy diagnosis of heart failure (OR 2.0,
P = 0.02), maternal arterial hypertension (OR 1.4, P = 0.02), previous
vitamin K antagonist treatment (within 1 year before pregnancy, OR
3.2, P = 0.004), and prior fertility treatment (within 1 year before
pregnancy, OR 1.5, P = 0.004) with neonatal immaturity or low birth
weight (Supplementary material online, Table SD). In addition, maternal age (OR 2.1/10 years, P < 0.001) and moderate complexity maternal heart defect (OR 2.26 vs. simple defects, P < 0.001) emerged as
significant predictors of neonatal chromosomal anomalies or visible
abnormalities on multivariate logistic regression analysis (Supplementary material online, Table SE).

Neonatal recurrence rate of congenital
heart disease
To assess recurrence rates in neonates of mothers with CHD compared to the control population, the percentage of newborn/children
with a documented CHD code was quantified. Overall, 17.7% of children to ACHD mothers and 2.9% of children from the noncongenital control group had a congenital heart defect code
recorded (P < 0.001). To further exclude liberal coding including suspicion of CHD only, we also evaluated the percentage of children
requiring cardiac surgery with heart-lung machine (HLM) support.
As some cardiac defects are not detected immediately at birth and
there may be time delay in coding, we assessed the prevalence of
congenital codes within the first month of life, the first year of life, as
well as <_6 years of age. At 1 month of age, 3.18% of children to

congenital mothers compared to 0.21% of newborn in the control
group had a documented CHD code and required cardiac surgery
with HLM (P < 0.001). Within the first year (<_6 years) of age, 5.47%
(5.95%) of children to ACHD mothers vs. 0.36% (0.39%) of children
in the control group required surgery for ACHD (P < 0.001 for
both). Within the group of liveborn children to congenital mothers,
the percentage of children with heart defects requiring cardiac surgery with HLM increased from 1.77% (2.03%) to 9.06% (9.93%) and
21.48% (22.60%) at <_1 (<_6 years) of age (P < 0.001 for both) with
increasing cardiac defect complexity of the mother (simple vs. moderate vs. complex defect). As a group the recurrence risk for CHD
requiring surgery with HLM was highest in mothers with univentricular hearts (26.5% <_6 years of age).
Information on the temporal changes in neonatal and maternal
morbidity is provided in the Supplementary material online, Appendix
Figures SH-SJ.

Discussion
Based on a large administrative dataset of women with CHD and
pregnancy, the current study supports the notion that maternal death
is uncommon in contemporary high-resource healthcare systems
providing appropriate management and counselling for women with
CHD. In this study including over 7000 ACHD pregnancies, no
affected woman died as a result of pregnancy. Although maternal
morbidity was in absolute terms also reassuringly low, it was nevertheless increased compared to non-CHD controls and especially
neonatal complications including mortality were more frequent. In
addition, a relevant proportion of neonates had visible or chromosomal abnormalities, or presented with CHD themselves, thus
requiring cardiac surgery within the first years of life. Therefore, the

data suggest that beyond continuing efforts to advise against high-risk
pregnancies, the focus of counselling in women with CHD associated
with acceptable pregnancy risk should shift to neonatal health issues
and complications. The proportion of newborns with congenital
heart defects increased in line with disease complexity. The most important multivariable predictors of adverse neonatal outcome were
maternal age, complexity of underlying heart defect, need for anticoagulation before pregnancy, and prior fertility treatment.
Large national and international efforts have provided important
insights into maternal and neonatal risk factors in CHD. These data
include the European Registry on Pregnancy and Heart Disease
(ROPAC) reporting a maternal mortality rate of 1%, mostly due to
fatal events in developing countries and associated with valvular
lesions.10 Consistent with our data, CHD patients had relatively low
mortality rates and outcome was superior to other forms of structural heart disease in the ROPAC registry. The authors suggested
that this may be due to a high proportion of CHD patients who
underwent corrective surgery and benefitted from appropriate preconception management.10 However, considerable maternal morbidity and a high rate of neonatal complications were observed.
Specifically investigating pregnancy in women with CHD, Drenthen
et al.8 (ZAHARA) and Silversides et al.11 (CARPREG II) developed
risk scores of adverse maternal and neonatal outcome. Including
1302 and 1938 pregnancies these studies draw particular attention to

important physiological parameters associated with increased risk in
this setting. These risk factors include functional class, cyanosis, systolic ventricular dysfunction, aortic dimensions, valvular regurgitation,
the presence of mechanical heart valves, as well as pulmonary hypertension. Due to the design of our study, many of these functional
parameters were not available for analysis. However, consistent with
previous reports, anticoagulation treatment and fertility treatment
emerged as risk factor for adverse events in our analysis. Predicting
risk to offspring is particularly challenging in the setting of CHD and
the external validity of available tools is unfortunately still suboptimal.18,19 Due to the nature of our study and the lack of more granular
data, such as symptoms and imaging parameters of heart size and
function, we abstained from developing a risk model for neonatal or
maternal outcome. However, on multivariate analysis heart defect
complexity, diagnosis of heart failure, arterial hypertension, treatment with vitamin K antagonists before pregnancy, as well as fertility
treatment preceding pregnancy emerged as significant adverse predictors of outcome. In addition, higher maternal age and moderate
complexity maternal heart defect emerged as significant predictors of
neonatal chromosomal anomalies or visible abnormalities. These factors are in line with previous studies and should be considered when
gauging risk for the neonate.
It was reassuring to note that real-world risk stratification and
management of women with CHD appear to work in the German

Maternal and neonatal complications in congenital heart disease

Strength of the current report
To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest cohort of pregnancies in ACHD reported in the literature providing population-based
real-world data for maternal and neonatal complications. The current
report highlights the low maternal mortality achievable in high-resource health systems and draws attention to the persistent excess
morbidity and mortality rate of offspring to ACHD mothers. Using a
robust, complete, and representative administrative database we also
highlight the significant recurrence rate of CHD in women with
ACHD.

Limitations
The underlying database was not designed for research purposes but
represents an administrative database. While this offers the advantage
of a complete and validated dataset of diagnostic codes and procedures, it lacks granularity in terms of symptoms, imaging, or laboratory results. While maternal anticoagulation was identified as a
significant risk factor for severe neonatal complications we cannot
comment on the link between mechanical valves mandating anticoagulation and neonatal complications. Further studies such as the ongoing European ROPAC registry are required to clarify this
important issue. Therefore, we cannot assess the impact of these important aspects on maternal of neonatal outcome. In addition, as maternal outcome was generally good in the current study, we lack
events to establish a robust risk model for maternal adverse outcome
based on the BARMER dataset. Furthermore, the favourable maternal
outcome should not be misinterpreted to conclude that all ACHD
patients have a low pregnancy risk but rather that in a highly developed healthcare system with assumingly appropriate counselling and
pregnancy care such good outcomes can be achieved. This requires
that patients who have a high or prohibitively high maternal risk are
discouraged from pregnancy. The current sample is biased towards
those women who, by interaction with the healthcare system, were
not advised against pregnancy or decided to pursue pregnancy.

Conclusions
This population-based study of pregnancy in adults with CHD illustrates a reassuringly low maternal rate of mortality and serious complications in a highly developed healthcare system. These results
should not be misinterpreted as a carte blanche for pregnancy in all
CHD women but a testimony that the appropriate interaction of
patients with the healthcare system can lead to low maternal risk and
reasonable maternal complication rates. Maternal morbidity and in
particular neonatal morbidity and mortality were nevertheless significantly increased in women with ACHD and their offspring compared
to non-ACHD controls highlighting the need of specialized care and
pre-pregnancy counselling.

healthcare system. Overall, <1% of CHD women undergoing pregnancy in the current study were in the modified WHO Class IV (i.e.
group of patients with prohibitively high pregnancy risk).9,20
Unfortunately, some criteria required to classify patients into the appropriate WHO class were not available from our administrative
dataset (e.g. severe ventricular dysfunction, aortic dimensions, or severity of valve disease), however, based on diagnosis we estimate
that <10% are in WHO class III. As a consequence, the lack of
observed maternal mortality is probably, both, the result of avoidance of very high-risk pregnancies and appropriate pregnancy management in the current sample. Based on the fact that no case of
maternal death was also observed in 7512 CHD pregnancies we calculated an upper 95% confidence interval for CHD maternal rate of
6.4 deaths/10 000 pregnancies in this population. The observed maternal mortality of the control group (1/11 225 pregnancies) is also in
line with national statistics suggesting a maternal death rate of 0.3-
0.5/10 000 pregnancies. Reassuringly, the percentage of teen pregnancies <_16 years of age was below 1% in our congenital cohort.
While maternal morbidity related to heart failure and cardiac
arrhythmias was increased in the current study compared to nonCHD women, the overall rates were relatively low with <0.7% of
ACHD women requiring hospitalization for heart failure or arrhythmias during pregnancy overall. Even in patients with complex defects
the rate of hospitalization for heart failure or cardiac arrhythmias was
2.7% and 1.0%, respectively. Higher morbidity rates in registry
reports may be due to selection bias and the weakness of defining
heart failure by the shortness of breath during pregnancy not requiring treatment. Such data may overestimate the complication rate and
risk of pregnancy.
Surprisingly, the rate of recurrence of CHD in our cohort was
found to be higher than previously suspected especially for mothers
with complex underlying congenital defects.21 Especially the recurrence rates of CHD in mothers affected themselves were twice to
three times higher compared to the literature. To exclude that this
phenomenon was due to liberal coding, we also evaluated the percentage of offspring requiring well documented cardiac procedures.
This revealed that 6% of children to ACHD mothers had cardiac
surgery by the age of 6 years, therefore suggesting that the overall
burden of disease is higher. Especially children to CHD mothers with
moderate and high complexity lesions had high recurrence rates of
9.9% and 22.6%, respectively. These aspects require further investigation, are, however, consistent with the notion that incidence rates of
CHD may increase with improving diagnostic technology22,23 and
should be considered when providing preconception counselling to
women and in the planning of pre-natal screening procedures in this
high-risk population.
