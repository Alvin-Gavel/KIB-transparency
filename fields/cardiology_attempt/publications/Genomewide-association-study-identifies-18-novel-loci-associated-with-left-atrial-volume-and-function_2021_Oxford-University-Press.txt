Aims

Left atrial (LA) volume and function impose significant impact on cardiovascular pathogenesis if compromised. We
aimed at investigating the genetic architecture of LA volume and function using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging
data.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
We used the UK Biobank, which is a large prospective population study with available phenotypic and genetic data.
On a subset of 35 658 European individuals, we performed genome-wide association studies on five volumetric
and results

and functional LA variables, generated using a machine learning algorithm. In total, we identified 18 novel genetic
loci, mapped to genes with known roles in cardiomyopathy (e.g. MYO18B, TTN, DSP, ANKRD1) and arrhythmia (e.g.
TTN, CASQ2, MYO18B, C9orf3). We observed high genetic correlation between LA volume and function and stroke,
which was most pronounced for LA passive emptying fraction (rg  1/4  0.40, P = 4  10-6). To investigate whether the
genetic risk of atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with LA traits that precede overt AF, we produced a polygenetic
risk score for AF. We found that polygenetic risk for AF is associated with increased LA volume and decreased LA
function in participants without AF [LAmax 0.25 (mL/m2)/standard deviation (SD), 95% confidence interval (CI)
(0.15; 0.36), P = 5.13  10-6; LAmin 0.21 (mL/m2)/SD, 95% CI (0.15; 0.28), P = 1.86  10-10; LA active emptying fraction -0.35%/SD, 95% CI (-0.43; -0.26), P = 3.14  10-14].

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
We report on 18 genetic loci associated with LA volume and function and show evidence for several plausible candidate genes important for LA structure.

Translational perspective
Atrial cardiomyopathy has been suggested to play an important role in the development of atrial fibrillation (AF). Using machine-learning algorithms, we segmented and annotated the left atrium (LA) in cardiac magnetic resonance data from 35 658 individuals. We identified 18 novel genetic loci associated with LA volume and function, many near well-established cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia genes.
We observed high genetic correlation between LA volume and function and stroke. We found that the genetic risk of AF influences LA
structure prior to diagnosis of AF, suggesting an intrinsic relationship.

Introduction
The left atrium (LA) serves primarily as a reservoir chamber of blood
entering the heart from the pulmonary veins and is important for
enhancing ventricular filling. Changes in left atrial (LA) volume and
function have been associated with impaired cardiac performance,1
arrhythmogenesis,2 risk of stroke,3 and mortality.4 Left atrial

and changes in the LA are traditionally considered secondary to
other cardiovascular diseases. However, the pathology behind
changes in LA volume and function and the association with atrial fibrillation (AF), heart failure (HF), and risk of stroke is poorly characterized.6,7,8 An increasing interest in LA pathology and atrial tissue
prompted the need for defining atrial cardiomyopathy.9 In a recent

Genome-wide association study on left atrial volume and function based on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Imaging data from 35 658 individuals
were exposed to machine learning algorithms to annotate five left atrial traits. A total of 18 novel genetic loci were associated with left atrial volume and
function. Of these, 15 constituted unique loci. Genes marked with bold have previously been associated with cardiomyopathy.

Left atrial volume and function CMR GWAS in UKBB

Methods
UK Biobank
UK Biobank is a large, population-based, prospective cohort study with
500 000 participants aged 40-69 years at the time of recruitment
(2006-10). The biobank holds a variety of health-related information on
participants, including health records, imaging data, lifestyle indicators,
cognitive function, biomarkers from blood and urine, imputed genomewide genotypes, information on population structure, relatedness, and
genotype-level quality. A detailed description of data collection and study
protocol has been provided previously by Bycroft et al.13
All participants gave written informed consent and the study complies
with the Declaration of Helsinki.

Derivation of cardiac magnetic resonance
measurements
The UKBB CMR protocol has previously been described in detail.14 In
brief, CMR scans were performed using a 1.5 Tesla scanner
(MAGNETOM Aera, Syngo Platform VD13A, Siemens Healthcare,
Erlangen, Germany) using an 18-channel body coil. Long-axis cines and a
complete short axis stack of balanced steady-state free precession cines
were acquired at one slice per breath hold.
Cardiac magnetic resonance DICOM images on >43 000 individuals
were converted into NifTI format. In an automated image analysis, the
NifTI images were quality controlled and followed by annotation of cardiac imaging traits from the segmentations, using a trained fully convolutional network architecture. The method is described in detail by Bai
et al.,15 see URLs for source code and model availability. The reported
mean Dice metric for LA segmentation of the model was 0.93 for LA
(2-ch) and 0.95 for LA (4-ch).15 The following traits were derived as
described below: indexed LA maximum (LAmax) and LA minimum
(LAmin) volumes, LA active emptying fraction (LAAEF), LA passive emptying fraction (LAPEF), and LA total emptying fraction (LATEF).

..
Annotations of cardiac atrial imaging traits were defined by the identifi..
.. cation of the global maximum LA volume in a phase, followed by a local
.. minimum (LA mid-diastolic volume; LAmdv), a subsequent local maximum
..
.. (LA volume before atrial contraction; LAbac) and lastly a global minimum
.. volume (Supplementary material online, Figure S1). Cardiac magnetic res..
.. onance images were excluded if any of these points could not be identi.. fied. Left atrial volumes were indexed by body surface area, calculated on
.. each participant using Du Bois formula,16 denoted LAmax and LAmin (mL/
.. 2
.. m ). Left atrial passive emptying fraction was calculated as (LAmax -
.. LAmdv)/LAmax * 100, LAAEF as (LAbac - LAmin)/LAbac * 100 and LATEF
.. as (LA - LAmin)/LAmax * 100. See Supplementary material online,

expert consensus document, written by internationally recognized
experts, atrial cardiomyopathy was defined as structural, architectural, contractile, or electrophysiological changes affecting the atria
with the potential to produce clinically relevant manifestations.6
Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is at present the gold
standard for assessing cardiac volumes, with a superior accuracy and
precision compared with other imaging modalities such as echocardiography.10 The clinical use of CMR is currently expanding due to lowered costs and increased accessibility, but the widespread use of the
CMR modality is still limited.
Genetics play a major role in ventricular cardiomyopathies and
could also play a role in several of the pathophysiological mechanisms
behind atrial cardiomyopathy,6 but large-scale genetic studies of LA
volume and function are lacking. Prior genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on cardiac chamber volumes and function have been
limited to echocardiographic measurements11 or CMR imagingderived left ventricular (LV) phenotypes.12
UK Biobank (UKBB) provides extensive phenotypic and genotypic
data on more than 500 000 individuals from the British general
population.13 At the time of this study, a subset of UKBB participants
had CMR imaging data available, which enabled the coupling of genetic data with these state-of-the-art imaging variables. Using a validated
machine learning algorithm to annotate the LA, we performed
GWAS on five LA volume and function traits.

Variance component analysis
(h2g )

Single nucleotide polymorphism heritability
and genetic correlation
(rg) were estimated with the BOLT-REML algorithm for variance component analysis.20 As input, we used the model SNPs described in the genetic analysis above. Sex, age, genotyping array, assessment centre, and PC
1-10 were used as covariates in the analysis. The variance explained by
each sentinel SNP was calculated with effect allele frequency (f) and beta
(B) estimates, in SD-1, with the formula R2  1/4  B2(1-f)2f.21 For each trait
separately the total variance explained by the sentinel SNPs was calculated by summing the variance explained by each sentinel.

We compared the phenotypic correlation between LA traits using
Pearson's correlation. Furthermore, we evaluated the correlation between LA traits and measurements of LV ejection fraction (LVEF), LV
end-diastolic volume (LVEDV), and LV end-systolic volume (LVESV). Left
ventricular measurements were derived simultaneously to the annotation
of the LA, as described by Bai et al.15

Genetic correlation of left atrial traits with
other traits
Using summary statistics, we applied LD score regression (LDSC software) to estimate the genetic correlation between LA traits and 10 traits
selected based on availability and relevance for cardiovascular disease
[AF, type 2 diabetes (T2D), systolic and diastolic blood pressure, any
stroke, any ischaemic stroke, cardioembolic stroke (CES), HF, overall
health rating, BMI; Supplementary material online, Data S2, stroke definitions from the MEGASTROKE Consortium].22 We excluded the MHC
region and SNPs with MAF <1%. Only phenotypes with a mean v2 > 1.02
were considered. Pre-computed LD scores for HapMap3 SNPs were
used in the regression (see URLs).

Biological and functional annotation
Loci were formed around sentinel SNPs. Sentinel SNPs were chosen by
the lowest P-value. Variants that were nominally significant (P < 0.05) and
within 1000 kb and a r2 > 0.1 of the sentinel SNPs were assigned to a
locus. The locus region was defined by the SNPs assigned to a locus. To
identify independently associated variants within a locus, we performed
conditional and joint analyses using GCTA-cojo v.1.91 with default
settings.23

Co-localization
We investigated co-localization with expression quantitative trait loci
(eQTL) using coloc.24 We tested all genes with a significant cis-eQTL association within 250 kb of the sentinel SNP in each locus. Pre-computed ciseQTLs from LV and atrial appendage tissue were obtained from GTEx
v.8 (see URLs). We used the coloc.abf function with default settings and
tested variants intersecting both GTEx and GWAS datasets. We
reported on eQTLs for genes with high evidence of co-localization (posterior probability >0.75).

Transcriptome-wide analyses
We used MetaXcan v0.625 to investigate mediating effects of gene expression levels on LA traits. Using summary statistics and eQTL data
(GTEx v.7 atrial appendage and LV heart tissue, see URLs) we performed
gene-based association analyses of predicted gene expression and phenotype risk. We tested 5369 genes with available expression data in the LV
and 5982 in the atrial appendage. A P < 9.3  10-6 was considered significant in the LV and a P < 8.4  10-6 was considered significant in atrial

appendage tissue. See Supplementary material online, Methods for further
details.

FINEMAP
In an effort to identify plausible causal variants, we employed FINEMAP
v1.426 at each of the 18 identified loci. All variants within 500 kb of a sentinel SNP were used to model each locus. Variants with a log10 Bayes factor (log10BF) >2 were functionally annotated using snpEFF v.4.327 and
dbNSFP v2.9.28

Conditional analysis
Mediating effects on loci by AF or HF were analysed by performing conditional analyses with multi-trait conditional and joint analysis (mtCojo)
from GCTA v1.92.29 The mtCojo method is able to condition phenotype
y on phenotype x using GWAS summary statistics. These estimates are
free from collider bias, which otherwise can occur when adjusting for
heritable covariates.30 For estimation of LD structure, a reference sample
set of 12 000 individuals without CMR imaging and free from AF or HF
was randomly selected from UKBB. Left atrial traits summary statistics
were adjusted on GWAS summary statistics of AF31 and HF.32

Polygenetic risk score for atrial fibrillation
We derived a polygenetic risk score (PRS) for AF using stacked clumping
and thresholding.33 A penalized regression was used for stacking the
clumping and threshold predictions. Therefore, the penalized regression
was fitted on a training set and then predicted onto the CMR cohort.
Unrelated UKBB participants with European ancestry and without available CMR (n = 332 673) were used for developing the PRS (the training
set). Input beta estimates and P-values came from summary statistics
from a GWAS on AF not containing the UKBB cohort.34 We used SNPs
with MAF >1% and a grid of varying thresholds for P-values, base size for
clumping window and LD (r2) to derive intermediate PRSs (Supplementary material online, Table S1). The intermediate PRSs were stacked into
one PRS, weighted by a penalized logistic regression. The polygenetic risk
for AF was then calculated for each individual with available CMR and
free of AF included in this study. Additionally, we employed a two-sample
2-stage least square (2SLS) regression in order to explore the impact of
LA traits on AF, HF, and stroke (Supplementary material online,
Methods).

Mendelian randomization analyses
We used Mendelian randomization to investigate causal effects between
the five exposures AF,31 HF,32 SBP, coronary artery disease (CAD), and
T2D and LA traits. We employed the inverse-variance weighted
method35 as primary model, and Mendelian randomization-Egger regression, weighted median and mode-based estimates as sensitivity analyses.
All analyses were performed using the R package TwoSampleMR.36 The
MR Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and Outlier (MR-PRESSO) method was
used to assess whether any detectable effect was mediated through outliers. We selected SNPs that were genome-wide significant (P < 5 
10-8), and removed SNPs in LD using default settings (r2 < 0.001) in order
to obtain independent variants. A P < 0.05/5 traits = 0.01 was considered
statistically significant. See Supplementary material online, Methods for
references to MR tools.

Associations between left ventricular loci
and left atrial traits
To assess the role of LV loci in LA traits, we queried the genetic variants
associated with LV by Aung et al.12 in our summary statistics. To correct

Left atrial volume and function CMR GWAS in UKBB

for multiple testing, variants with a P < 0.05/(11 loci * 5 LA traits) =
0.0009 were considered significantly associated with LA traits.

Results
The overall study design is illustrated in Figure 1. Baseline characteristics of the study population are shown in Table 1 and summary of
CMR traits in Table 2. A comprehensive description of the selection
of study population and covariates is available in Supplementary material online, Methods.
A total of 35 658 individuals were included. The median age was
64 years (IQR 58-70), average BMI was 26 (SD = 4) and 52% were
women. Biplane LAmax had a mean of 39 mL/m2 (SD = 11 mL/m2), biplane LAmin had a mean of 16 mL/m2 (SD = 6 mL/m2), and LATEF
61% (SD = 8%), which are comparable to previous studies on reference values on the UKBB cohort37 (Supplementary material online,
Figure S2). The reproducibility of the included images with automatic
and manual measurements was high (intraclass correlation coefficient
[ICC]lamax = 0.93, ICClamin = 0.88, n = 50; Supplementary material online, Methods).

Identification of loci associated with left
atrial volume and function
We identified 18 novel loci associated with LA volume and function
(LAmax n = 2; LAmin n = 3; LAAEF n = 6; LAPEF n = 2; LATEF n = 5,
Figure 2, Supplementary material online, Data S3). Of these, 15 constituted unique loci. Several loci were associated with multiple LA traits,
e.g. rs9664170 in proximity of ANKRD1 reached genome-wide significance in LAmax, LAmin, and LAAEF (MAF = 41%, LAmax/LAmin/LAAEF
P = 4.3  10-8/6.8  10-10/3.4  10-9). There was little evidence of
population stratification or cryptic relatedness (Supplementary material online, Figures S6 and S7 and Table S2). Regional plots for each
locus are shown in Supplementary material online, Figure S8. We conducted three sensitivity analyses, to test the robustness and reproducibility of our results. The main results did not materially change,
when we excluded individuals with AF, valvular heart disease or
when adjusting for blood pressure (Supplementary material online,
Data S4). Moreover, nominally significant variants (P < 0.05) in the
reported loci correlated with beta estimates obtained in the sensitivity models (min r > 0.98).
Variance explained by loci was 0.29/0.18/0.63/0.21/0.50% for
LAmax/LAmin/LAAEF/LAPEF/LATEF, respectively (Supplementary material online, Data S5).

Heritability and genetic correlation of
left atrial traits
Heritability estimates were h2g = 0.24/0.22/0.17/0.18/0.16 for LAmax/
LAmin/LAAEF/LAPEF/LATEF, respectively (Supplementary material
online, Figure S9 and Data S6). We observed a high genetic correlation between LAmax and LAmin (rg  1/4  0.94), as well as LAAEF and
LATEF (rg  1/4  0.92). Left atrial emptying fractions had a negative genetic correlation with LA volumes, e.g. LATEF with LAmax/min (rg  1/4 
-0.59/-0.84). Left atrial traits had a lower genetic correlation with LV
traits (LVEDV, LVESV, LVEF). The highest absolute genetic correlation with LV traits was observed between LAmax and LVEDV (rg  1/4

Characterization of left atrial associated
loci
We examined co-localization of loci and eQTLs by conducting a
Bayesian co-localization analysis.24 Using GTEx v.8 tissue samples
from atrial appendage (n = 372) and LV (n = 386), we found evidence
of co-localization (posterior probability > 0.75) between loci and
eQTL for 10 genes (Supplementary material online, Data S7). Left
atrial volume associated loci co-localized with ANKRD1. Left atrial

function associated loci co-localized with C9orf3 (also known as
AOPEP), CASQ2, RP11-10A14.4, VANGL1, and RP11-236B18.2. Loci
associated with both LA function and volume co-localized with
BHMG1, DMWD, PCGF5, and SYMPK. Interestingly, the genes BHMG1,
DMWD, and SYMPK reside in the same gene dense on chromosome
19. We also investigated the effects of gene expression levels on LA
traits in a transcriptome-wide analysis (TWAS) using MetaXcan. This
revealed 20 associations between the predicted gene expression and
LA volume/function (Supplementary material online, Methods, Figures
S10 and S11, and Data S8-S17). Interestingly, the expression of
C9orf3 was associated with increased LA function and decreased LA
volume in atrial appendage tissue samples (LAmin/LAAEF/LATEF,
P = 9.1  10-8/4.7  10-6/3.0  10-7).
In a further effort to identify genes that might be causally linked to
the associated loci, we used FINEMAP26 to identify credibly causal
alleles. We identified seven missense variants in genes associated
with LA function (Supplementary material online, Data S18), e.g. missense variants associated with LAAEF in the genes CASQ2, CILP, DSP,
and SIX5, and a missense variant in TTN associated with LAPEF. Two
missense variants associated with LATEF were identified in CASQ2
and MYO18B. Functional characterization and evidence linking genes
to loci are summarized in Table 3.

Genetic correlation with cardiovascular
traits
Using LD score regression, we investigated the genetic correlation of
LA volume and function with selected cardiovascular diseases (Figure
3 for nominal significant associations, Supplementary material online,
Data S19 for all associations). Atrial fibrillation, CES, and HF had
higher genetic correlation estimates with LAmin than LAmax (LAminAF rg = 0.20, P = 3  10-4; LAmin-CES rg  1/4  0.32, P = 4  10-3; LAminHF rg  1/4  0.19, P = 4  10-2). For LA functional traits, we observed the
highest genetic correlation in LAPEF with all-cause stroke (AS) and
HF (rg  1/4  0.40, P = 4  10-6; rg  1/4  0.53, P = 6  10-7), whereas the genetic correlation between LAPEF and AF did not reach nominal significance. Left atrial passive emptying fraction had higher genetic
correlation estimates than other LA traits with overall health rating,
DBP and SBP (rg  1/4  0.33, P = 4  10-12; rg  1/4  -0.32, P = 3  10-11; rg
 1/4  -0.28, P = 1  10-8). Among LA functional traits, LATEF had the
highest genetic correlation with AF and CES (rg  1/4  0.26, P = 5 x 10-5; rg
 1/4  0.38, P = 5  10-3).

Structural effects of polygenetic risk for
atrial fibrillation
To identify whether genetic risk of AF yields LA structural changes
without AF diagnosis, we produced a PRS for AF. We calculated the
estimated polygenetic risk for AF in each included individual with
available CMR and without AF (n = 34 945, the test set), given our
stated definition of AF (Supplementary material online, Methods).
Fitting a linear model adjusted for age and sex, we found that the AF
PRS was associated with decreased LAAEF [-0.35%/SD, 95% confidence interval (CI) (-0.43; -0.26), P = 3.14  10-14] and LATEF [-0.27
SD, 95% CI (-0.35; -0.19), P = 4.57  10-11], but not with LAPEF
(P = 0.54). Atrial fibrillation PRS was also associated with increased
LAmax and LAmin [LAmax 0.25 (mL/m2)/SD, 95% CI (0.15; 0.36),
P = 5.13  10-6; LAmin 0.21 (mL/m2)/SD, 95% CI (0.15; 0.28), P = 1.86

 10-10]. Furthermore, 2SLS regression of sentinel SNP allele scores
indicated that LA function has an impact on AF risk [LAAEF/SD OR =
0.69, 95% CI (0.57; 0.84), P = 2  10-4; LAPEF/SD OR = 0.43, 95% CI
(0.31; 0.61), P = 1.0  10-6; LATEF/SD OR = 0.41, 95% CI (0.33;
0.51), P = 1.0  10-15; Supplementary material online, Data S20]. For
LAAEF and LATEF, we also identified a nominal significant modification on the effect of AF-PRS for individuals with incident AF (LAAEF
P = 0.019, LATEF P = 0.036; Supplementary material online, Methods
and Data S21).

Conditional analyses and Mendelian
randomization
To estimate whether the associations between genetics and LA traits
were mediated by AF or HF, we performed a conditional analysis
using mtCOJO.29 All identified sentinel SNPs with their respective
LA trait were conditioned on either AF or HF, using publicly available
summary statistics. We did not observe any mediating effect on beta
estimates greater than the estimated standard error, which suggests
that SNP effect sizes are independent from AF and HF
(Supplementary material online, Figure S12 and Data S22).
Next, we estimated the causal effects of AF, HF, SBP, CAD, and
T2D on LA traits using MR.
We found supporting evidence for a casual effect of SBP on all LA
traits (Supplementary material online, Data S23). Systolic blood pressure increases LA volume and decreases LA function (beta LAmax/

..
.. LAmin/LAAEF/LAPEF/LATEF = 0.23/0.21/-0.01/-0.18/-0.11 SD/SD-1,
.. P < 0.01). The effect of SBP was larger on LAPEF than on LAAEF,
..
.. which is in line with other findings on LAPEF. We also found robust
.. support for a casual effect of AF, which show congruent causal effects
..
.. on LA volume, LAAEF, and LATEF (Supplementary material online,
.. Data S23). Atrial fibrillation was similarly associated with an increase
..
.. in LAmin/max, (beta LAmax and LAmin = 0.07 and 0.1 SD, respectively,
.. P < 0.0.1) and decrease in LAAEF and LATEF (beta LAAEF and
..
.. LATEF = -0.11 and 0.10 SD, respectively, P < 0.01), but had no statis.. tically significant effect on LAPEF.

(Graphical abstract). Furthermore, we established a set of credible
causal genes, of which many have a previously established relation to
AF or cardiomyopathy. We evaluated the casual relationship between AF and LA traits with MR analyses and found supporting evidence of AF being causal for increased LA volume and decreased
active and total emptying function. We show that polygenetic risk for
AF is associated with increased LA volume and decreased LA function, in participants without prior diagnosis of AF. This suggests that
structural and functional dysfunction may appear before clinically
diagnosed AF.
Many of the genes identified in this study have previously been
linked to cardiomyopathy or muscular dystrophy. Using finemapping, seven plausibly causal missense variants associated with LA
function in the genes DSP, SIX5, MYO18B, CILP, TTN, and CASQ2. SIX5
resides in a gene dense region on chromosome 19, with neighbouring
genes such as DMKP and DMWD. This region is known to cause myotonic dystrophy type 1 through expansion of CTG repeats.38
MYO18B has recently been associated with AF.31 Zebrafish mutants
with loss of function of the myo18b gene show compromised sarcomere assembly and atrial enlargement,39 a hallmark of atrial cardiomyopathies. Similar findings have been reported in zebrafish with
titin-truncating variants.40 CILP, encoding cartilage intermediate layer
protein 1, has been shown as a marker for fibrosis, which can lead to
HF.41 Mutations in DSP, encoding the protein desmoplakin, are
known causes of several types of cardiomyopathy.42,43 The TTN gene
encodes the protein titin, which is responsible for the passive elasticity of the cardiomyocytes and has been associated with dilated cardiomyopathy and AF.40,44,45rs9664170, in proximity to ANKRD1
encoding the cardiac ankyrin repeat protein, was associated with
LAAEF and LAmax/min and showed evidence of co-localization with
eQTLs affecting expression of ANKRD1 and RP11-236B18.2. RP11-

236B18.2 is a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), residing adjacent to
ANKRD1. Long non-coding RNA has been shown to regulate gene
expression.46 Cardiac ankyrin repeat protein functions as a transcription co-factor and is a member of the titin-N2A mechanosensory
complex that translocate to the cell nucleus in response to stretch,
and has previously been associated with dilated cardiomyopathy.47
Cardiac ankyrin repeat protein expression is up-regulated in HF,
where it has been shown to suppress the expression of sarcomere
proteins.47 The SNP rs4074536 was associated with LAAEF and
LATEF and showed evidence of co-localization with CASQ2 eQTLs,
also supported by TWAS. CASQ2, encoding the gene calsequestrin 2,
is an important gene in calcium handling and cardiac contraction,
which is functionally in line with its association with LAAEF. CASQ2
has previously been associated with AF48 and catecholaminergic
polymorphic ventricular tachycardia.49 Although some of the identified loci have previously been associated with AF and HF, adjusting
our analyses for AF or HF genetics with conditional analyses did not
show any mediating effects.
Due to a growing interest in atrial cardiomyopathy, a number of
studies focusing on LA volume and function have previously been
conducted. These studies indicate that LA traits are independent predictors of a number of clinical outcomes such as stroke, HF, and
AF.50 In this study, we estimate that these LA traits have a SNP heritability of 16-26%. Left atrial volume is more heritable than LA function. Left atrial volume traits are highly genetically correlated but
LAAEF and LAPEF are different genetic entities based on genetic
correlation.
Recent GWAS on AF have implicated numerous genes associated
with cardiomyocyte function.31 Moreover, a growing body of evidence suggests that rare variants in structural genes cause AF.40,51
Previous reports have shown that decreased LAAEF is associated

with an increased risk of AF.52 To evaluate the influence of predisposition to AF on the volumetric and functional properties of the atria,
we produced an AF-PRS. We found that our AF-PRS was associated
with lower LAAEF in individuals without known AF. This suggests
that the increased risk of AF in part is mediated by predisposition to
alterations in atrial function that precede the development of AF. In
fact, LAAEF was associated with genes previously associated with
cardiomyopathy. Whether the same genes expressed in the atria give
rise to an atrial cardiomyopathy that precedes overt AF remains to
be established.
By separating the passive and active emptying function in our genetic analyses of the LA, we discern that these traits have vastly different genetic bases. We observed a higher genetic correlation
between LAAEF, AF, and CES compared with LAPEF. With regards
to LAPEF, we found no significant association between the genetically

predictive risk of AF and LAPEF. However, we found larger genetic
correlations for LAPEF with traditional cardiovascular risk factors
and diseases (e.g. BMI, all-cause stroke, blood pressure, and HF) compared with LAAEF. This could be of importance since the mechanisms giving rise to stroke may differ and the link between the atria
and CES needs further refinement. When looking at the overlap between LV and LA genetics, we found LV loci close to the TTN gene
associated significantly with LAPEF. It is possible that this overlap
could be mediated by the gene TTN, which plays an important role in
ventricular cardiomyocyte sarcomere elasticity. Impaired ventricular
elasticity could in theory influence the passive emptying of the atria.
Traditionally, LAmax is used to assess LA volume. However, LAmin
has previously been found to have a stronger predictive value of AF,
as well as subclinical AF, than LAmax.2,52 In line with these reports, our
genetic analyses show that LAmin has a larger genetic overlap with AF

and CES than LAmax. Using MR analyses, we measured that AF had a
larger effect on LAmin than LAmax, altogether reiterating the role of
LAmin as important when evaluating cardiac disease.
Our findings should be interpreted within the context of their limitations. To avoid population stratification bias, we excluded persons
with non-European ancestry from analyses. Our findings are therefore limited to European ancestry only and cannot be directly
extrapolated to other populations. However, they do inform us of
fundamental important biological processes in the LA. Annotation of
LA traits is based on machine learning algorithms with the resulting
strengths and weaknesses. To evaluate the accuracy of the deep
learning model, we performed manual segmentation on a subset of
the dataset which validated the performance of the model. Although
our manual segmentation was highly correlated with the automated
segmentation, an overestimation was present for the automated segmentation compared with the manual. The overestimation was systematic and should therefore not influence the genetic results. Bai et
al.15 have previously validated the algorithm on UKBB CMR at a
larger scale with a Dice metric of 0.93 for LA (2-ch) and 0.95 LA (4ch). Also, they note that the automated method is trained by multiple
observers which may make it less susceptible to biases by learning a
consensus estimate, since manual inter-observer variability is to be
expected. However, the LA is challenging to measure and even after
quality control filtering, errors might remain that dilute the genetic
signal. In the future, refinements addressing these issues might be able
to enhance the genetic signal of these traits. Although the majority of
our findings are plausible candidate genes with well-described roles
in cardiac pathophysiology, future studies are needed to cement their
role in LA volume and function.
In conclusion, we report on 18 genetic loci associated with LA
function and volume. We show evidence for several plausible candidate genes important for atrial structure. Many of the genes associated with LA function have previously been linked with
cardiomyopathy. The results found in this study suggest that compromised LA function may share genetic underpinning with cardiomyopathy. Furthermore, we show that the genetic risk of AF influences LA
structure prior to diagnosis of AF, suggesting an intrinsic relationship.
