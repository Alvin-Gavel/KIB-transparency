intervention, but do we need it post-stenting?', by D. Erlinge and M. Gotberg, https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab525.

Aims

A fractional flow reserve (FFR) value >_0.90 after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is associated with a
reduced risk of adverse cardiovascular events. TARGET-FFR is an investigator-initiated, single-centre, randomized
controlled trial to determine the feasibility and efficacy of a post-PCI FFR-guided optimization strategy vs. standard
coronary angiography in achieving final post-PCI FFR values >_0.90.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
After angiographically guided PCI, patients were randomized 1:1 to receive a physiology-guided incremental optimization strategy (PIOS) or a blinded coronary physiology assessment (control group). The primary outcome was
and results
the proportion of patients with a final post-PCI FFR >_0.90. Final FFR <_0.80 was a prioritized secondary outcome.
A total of 260 patients were randomized (131 to PIOS, 129 to control) and 68.1% of patients had an initial postPCI FFR <0.90. In the PIOS group, 30.5% underwent further intervention (stent post-dilation and/or additional
stenting). There was no significant difference in the primary endpoint of the proportion of patients with final postPCI FFR >_0.90 between groups (PIOS minus control 10%, 95% confidence interval -1.84 to 21.91, P = 0.099). The
proportion of patients with a final FFR <_0.80 was significantly reduced when compared with the angiographyguided control group (-11.2%, 95% confidence interval -21.87 to -0.35], P = 0.045).

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
Over two-thirds of patients had a physiologically suboptimal result after angiography-guided PCI. An FFR-guided

optimization strategy did not significantly increase the proportion of patients with a final FFR >_0.90, but did reduce
the proportion of patients with a final FFR <_0.80.

Introduction
Fractional flow reserve (FFR)-guided percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), as compared with angiography-guided PCI, reduces
unnecessary stenting and lowers the risk of myocardial infarction at
2 years.1 The utility of measuring FFR after PCI is less certain but
post-PCI FFR values are reported to be inversely associated with adverse cardiac events.2 In a meta-analysis of 7470 patients, post-PCI
FFR values >_0.90 were associated with a lower risk of repeat PCI and
major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE).3 However, post-PCI
FFR is rarely assessed in clinical practice. Potential barriers may be
the assumptions that (i) the incidence of suboptimal FFR results post-

PCI is low; (ii) where this occurs, it is primarily related to residual diffuse disease in the vessel and, accordingly, (iii) there is limited scope
to improve the FFR result through further intervention.
In fact, data on post-PCI FFR vary widely and the true incidence of
suboptimal FFR after stenting is unknown. The reported proportion
of patients achieving an optimal post-PCI FFR of >_0.90 ranges from
21% to 100%.4-14 Furthermore, from previous reports, a post-PCI
FFR that remains below the clinical threshold for revascularization
(FFR <_0.80) despite angiographically successful PCI may occur in
<1% or as many 36.5% of patients.11-24 Registry data indicate that
identifying and intervening on coronary arteries with suboptimal
post-PCI FFR can achieve improvements in the final FFR value but

with varying degrees of success.14,25,26 The Trial of Angiography vs.
pressure-Ratio-Guided Enhancement Techniques-Fractional Flow
Reserve (TARGET-FFR) was designed to assess the efficacy of a
post-PCI physiology-guided incremental optimization strategy (PIOS)
vs. standard angiographic guidance in achieving final post-PCI FFR values >_0.90.

Methods
Study design
TARGET-FFR was a prospective, single-centre, randomized, controlled,
parallel group, blinded, clinical trial conducted at the Golden Jubilee
National Hospital in Glasgow, UK. The study complies with the
Declaration of Helsinki and the West of Scotland Research Ethics
Committee 3 gave it a favourable opinion on 18 August 2017 (reference
17/WS/0153). The trial was sponsored and monitored by the NHS
National Waiting Times Centre. Coronary physiology data were adjudicated and validated by a core laboratory (CoreAalst BV, Aalst, Belgium)
blinded to treatment group assignment. Clinical endpoints were adjudicated by an independent Clinical Events Committee. The study rationale
and design have been described previously.27 The study is registered on
ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT03259815).

Participants
Patients eligible for the trial were >18 years of age and undergoing PCI
for either stable angina, medically stabilized non-ST-elevation myocardial
infarction (NSTEMI), or staged completion of non-culprit vessel revascularization following either NSTEMI or ST-elevation myocardial infarction
(STEMI). Since the primary objective was focused on PCI optimization,
the target population was unrestricted and patients with either stable or
acute coronary syndromes (ACS) were included. Exclusion criteria were
PCI to a coronary bypass graft, PCI of an in-stent restenosis lesion, PCI to
a target artery providing Rentrop grade 2 or 3 collateral blood supply to

..
.. another vessel, inability to receive adenosine (e.g. severe reactive airway
.. disease, marked hypotension, or advanced atrioventricular block without
.. pacemaker), recent (within 1 week prior to cardiac catheterization)
..
.. STEMI in any arterial distribution (not specifically target lesion), severe
.. cardiomyopathy (left ventricular ejection fraction <30%), and renal insuf..
.. ficiency such that an additional 20-30 mL of contrast would, in the opin.. ion of the operator, pose unwarranted risk to the patient. Patients were
..
.. invited to participate prior to undergoing coronary angiography and were
.. enrolled only after providing written informed consent. All subjects com..
.. pleted Seattle Angina Questionnaires (SAQ-7) and the EQ-5D-5L health.. related quality of life questionnaire prior to their procedure.
..
..
..
..
..
.. Randomization and masking
.. Patients proceeding to PCI had invasive coronary physiology assessment
..
.. prior to intervention. Once the operator declared the PCI procedure to
.. be complete, patients meeting all inclusion and exclusion criteria were eli.. gible for randomization. This was performed in the catheterization la..
.. boratory using a 1:1 variable block (2, 4, 6) randomization method
.. generated through a secure (ISO 27001 and 9001 compliant) web-based
..
.. platform. The timing of the randomization before FFR measurement was
.. intended to limit bias and prevent selection of patients for randomization
..
.. when FFR was already known. An operator-blinded invasive coronary
.. physiology assessment was then performed. The coronary physiology
..
.. data were obscured and the digital interface was visible only to the re.. searcher (D.C.) who advised on measurement quality. This concluded
..
.. the procedure for all patients in the control group and those in the PIOS
.. intervention group with FFR >_0.90. In patients randomized to the PIOS
..
.. group with post-PCI FFR <0.90, operators reviewed the measurements
.. and planned additional intervention based on the findings of the FFR pull.. back assessment. Following these additional optimization measures,
..
.. physiology assessment was repeated and the procedure was completed.
.. Final coronary physiology results were not disclosed to patients.

Procedures
The PCI procedure was undertaken according to operator judgement
(including the use of intracoronary imaging) in line with contemporary
standards of care. All PCI procedures were performed using drug-eluting
stents.
Coronary physiology measurements were acquired using the
PressureWire X Guidewire (Abbott Laboratories, IL, USA) and analysed in real time (CoroFlow v3.0, Coroventis Research AB, Uppsala,
Sweden). Following administration of a 200 lg bolus of intracoronary
nitrate to the study artery, the pressure wire sensor was positioned at
the tip of the guide catheter and equalized with the aortic pressure.
The pressure wire was then advanced to position the sensor in the distal third of the vessel. Hyperaemia was induced by infusion of adenosine into an antecubital vein at a rate of 140 lg/kg/min. In addition to
resting Pd/Pa, the following non-hyperaemic pressure ratios were
measured: diastolic pressure ratio (dPR)-the Pd/Pa ratio of the averaged Pa and Pd values measured during the entire diastolic period of
five consecutive cardiac cycles; resting full-cycle ratio (RFR)-the lowest Pd/Pa ratio over an entire cardiac cycle averaged over five consecutive cycles. Microvascular function was simultaneously assessed with

FFR. Using a thermodilution technique, coronary flow reserve (CFR-
the ratio of resting to hyperaemic coronary flow) and the index of
microcirculatory resistance (IMR-the product of mean hyperaemic
distal coronary pressure and mean hyperaemic transit time) were calculated as previously described.27 Fractional flow reserve was measured during stable hyperaemia with the sensor positioned as far distally
in the vessel as practical. Finally, a hyperaemic pressure wire pullback
assessment was performed and the sensor returned to the tip of the
guide catheter to assess for pressure drift. If there was drift of >0.03
units, repeat measurements were requested. Using the CoroFlow software, the research cardiologist annotated the hyperaemic pullback
recording to co-register the anatomical landmarks during fluoroscopyguided pullback of the pressure wire (distal and proximal stent edges,
the position of relevant side branches and the tip of the guiding catheter, etc.). This allowed calculation of the hyperaemic trans-stent gradient (HTG) and localization of residual pressure gradients proximal or
distal to the stented segment.
Patients in the PIOS group with post-PCI FFR <0.90 had their coronary
physiology findings disclosed to the operator. Based on the clinical interpretation of the FFR changes (pressure loss) in the treated artery post-

PCI, the operator then followed the PIOS algorithm to optimize the final
PCI result (Figure 1). If the residual pressure gradient reflected diffuse atherosclerosis with no focal step-changes in pressure gradient, the result
was accepted and no optimization attempted.
Three months after PCI, participants were invited to complete questionnaires for anginal symptoms (SAQ-7) and health status (EQ-5D-5L).
The questionnaires were administered by telephone or mail by a research
nurse blinded to the randomized group allocation and the physiology
results. Clinical outcomes at 1-year post-PCI were assessed by electronic
health record linkage.
For the purposes of the primary and relevant secondary endpoints,
coronary physiology data underwent post hoc adjudication by an independent core laboratory (CoreAalst BV, Aalst, Belgium). Each individual
tracing was assessed for quality based on pre-specified criteria and
received a binary decision regarding adequate quality for inclusion in the
final analysis. Fractional flow reserve, CFR and IMR were calculated independently from the corresponding recordings. Further details on the
core lab adjudication process are available in the Supplementary material
online.

Outcomes
The primary endpoint of the study was the proportion of patients with a
final post-PCI FFR result >_0.90. Secondary endpoints were proportion of
patients with final FFR <_0.80 (the guideline-directed threshold for revascularization28); change from baseline SAQ-7 scores at 3 months; change
from baseline EQ-5D-5L scores at 3 months; rate of target vessel failure
and its components (cardiac death, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, unplanned re-hospitalization with target vessel revascularization) at

Results
Between 22 February 2018 and 22 November 2019, 1265 patients
attending for coronary angiography and/or PCI were assessed for eligibility (Figure 2). Of these, 721 were enrolled in the trial before their
procedures. Following PCI, 260 patients were randomized to either
the PIOS intervention group or control group (blinded physiology

assessment). Clinical and procedural characteristics at baseline were
evenly distributed between the randomized groups (Tables 1 and 2).
The mean initial post-PCI FFR for the overall population was
0.85 +/- 0.09. Intracoronary imaging was utilized during the initial PCI in
16.2% (42/260) of patients. There was no significant difference in initial post-PCI FFR between those with ICI-guided PCI (0.83 +/- 0.09)
and those guided by angiography alone (0.85 +/- 0.09, difference -0.02,

cremental optimization strategy group. Following an initial post-percutaneous coronary intervention fractional flow reserve
assessment, 29% of patients had a fractional flow reserve >_0.90 and
did not require optimization. Of the remaining 93 patients with fractional flow reserve <0.90, 33 had diffuse residual patterns, which did
not meet the protocol-defined criteria for further intervention.
Targets for additional intervention were identified in 60 patients.
Operators attempted functional optimization in 40 of these
patients. The remaining 20 cases in which optimization attempts
were not undertaken are discussed in the Supplementary material
online. FFR, fractional flow reserve; PIOS, physiologically guided incremental optimization strategy.

95% CI -0.05 to 0.01, P = 0.26). Overall, 30.5% (40/131) of patients
randomized to the PIOS group received further intervention (Figure
3). The left anterior descending (LAD) artery was the target vessel in
85% (34/40) of these patients. There were no significant differences
in physiology indices between randomized groups with respect to
final mean FFR values or the absolute and relative changes from prePCI to final post-PCI phases (Table 3). 34/117 (29.1%) in the PIOS
group had an initial post-PCI FFR <_0.80, improving to 22/118 (18.6%)
following additional FFR-guided optimization. The proportion of vessels with post-PCI FFR >_0.90 in the PIOS group was 42/117 (35.9%)
initially, increasing to 45/118 (38.1%) following additional PCI.
The primary and secondary endpoint results are presented in
Table 4. There was no significant difference between groups with respect to the primary endpoint of the proportion of patients with final
post-PCI FFR >_0.90 (PIOS minus control 10%, 95% CI -1.84 to 21.91,
P = 0.099). The proportion of patients with final FFR <_0.80 was significantly lower in the PIOS group (PIOS minus control -11.2%, 95% CI
-21.87 to -0.35, P = 0.045).
A per-protocol procedural and safety analysis of patients in the
PIOS group who underwent additional optimization identified that
this group had longer procedure durations with higher radiation, contrast and adenosine doses. There were no differences in the incidence of procedural complications when compared with those
patients who did not receive additional interventions (Supplementary
material online, Table S1).
Among patients who received further optimization, both FFR and
CFR increased significantly. Patients receiving an additional stent had
a greater increase in FFR than those who received further postdilation alone (Supplementary material online, Table S2). Non-STelevation ACS patients were medically stabilized and underwent PCI

on a priority outpatient basis at a median of 3 weeks following their
ACS presentation. Pre-PCI FFR values were lower in this cohort but
there was no significant difference in microvascular resistance (as represented by corrected IMR) compared with patients undergoing PCI
for either stable angina or staged completion of revascularization in
non-culprit vessels (Supplementary material online, Table S3). When
stratified by target vessel, there was no difference in mean pre-PCI
FFR values between vessels, however, post-PCI FFR was significantly
lower in the LAD (Supplementary material online, Table S4). The
LAD had a lower proportion of patients with a final FFR >_0.90 and a
higher proportion with FFR <_0.80 when compared with other vessels (Supplementary material online, Table S5).
The relative (percentage) change in FFR following PCI had a moderate but significant correlation with SAQ angina frequency score at
3-month follow-up (Spearman correlation coefficient 0.36,
P < 0.0001). Larger relative increases in FFR were associated with a
reduced burden of patient-reported angina at follow-up (Table 5).
There were no peri-procedural deaths. At a median follow-up of
2 years, there had been only one target vessel failure. This patient,
who was in the PIOS group but had not received any additional optimization, suffered a presumed cardiac death in the community
17 months after the procedure.

Discussion
In this randomized controlled trial of a coronary physiologyguided PCI optimization strategy, additional FFR-guided intervention after stenting did not significantly increase the proportion of patients achieving the optimal post-PCI FFR result of
>_0.90, but did reduce the proportion of patients with a final
FFR <_0.80 (the guideline-directed threshold for revascularization) when compared with the angiography-guided control
group (Graphical abstract)
There is a gap in clinical trial evidence on strategies to optimize
PCI outcomes.29 In a retrospective, single-centre registry of 664 vessels from 574 patients, 118 (17.8%) vessels were found to have a
post-PCI FFR <_0.80.19 Additional interventions were performed in
87/118 (73.7%) of these vessels which increased the final FFR to
>_0.80 in 58/87 (66.7%). In the overall population, additional postdilation or stenting reduced the proportion of vessels with post-PCI
FFR <_0.80 from 118 (17.8%) to 63 (9.5%). In total, 137 vessels
(20.6%) underwent further treatment for what were perceived to be
suboptimal post-PCI FFR results with further post-dilatation (42%)
and/or additional stenting (33%) or both (18%). Fractional flow reserve was repeated in all 137 lesions with an overall improvement
from 0.78 +/- 0.07 to 0.87 +/- 0.05. Amongst patients who received
post-dilatation only, FFR improved from 0.75 +/- 0.06 to 0.85 +/- 0.06.
This is perhaps not surprising when the particulars of the index PCI
procedure are examined. Just over half of lesions (n = 352, 53%)
were pre-dilated, the mean diameter of implanted stents was
2.87 mm and only 200 (30.1% of vessels) received post-dilatation. By
comparison, in TARGET-FFR, the mean stent diameter was 3.23 mm
with 100% and 98.1% rates of pre-dilatation and post-dilatation (with
on average a 0.5 mm larger non-compliant balloon), respectively
(Table 2). The yield from additional post-dilatation alone in our study
was more modest (FFR increased from 0.79 +/- 0.07 to 0.83 +/- 0.05,

by 6.1% (36.5-30.4%). The number of vessels with a final FFR >0.90
increased by 5 (2.1%). In TARGET-FFR's PIOS group, additional
FFR-guided optimization measures reduced the overall incidence of
FFR <_0.80 by 10.5% and increased the proportion of vessels with
post-PCI FFR >_0.90 by 2.2%.
Why is it so difficult to achieve a post-PCI FFR >_0.90? The answer
may be influenced by characteristics of the target coronary artery.
Percutaneous coronary intervention on a lesion in the LAD has previously been identified as an independent predictor of suboptimal
post-PCI FFR results14,19,21,22,30 and the LAD was the target vessel in
150/260 (57.7%) of patients in TARGET-FFR. Our data confirm that
both absolute post-PCI FFR values and the proportion of patients
achieving a final FFR value >_0.90 were significantly lower in the LAD
than either the left circumflex or right coronary arteries. There were,
however, no significant differences between vessels in post-PCI CFR
or corrected microvascular resistance. It has been postulated that
lower FFR values in the LAD relate to the larger area of myocardium
subtended by this vessel. Higher flow rates across long segments of
residual mild diffuse atheroma can result in large pressure gradients
in these vessels. Hydrostatic factors relating to coronary anatomy
and the height of the pressure wire sensor above or below the aortic
pressure transducer may also contribute to this phenomenon. Given
that achieving a post-PCI FFR >_0.90 in the LAD in anything other
than a minority of patients appears unlikely, does this threshold actually represent a realistic target or definition of a functionally optimal
PCI result in this vessel? In a registry of 835 patients who had postPCI FFR measured, Hwang et al.23 reported that the optimal cut-off
values for predicting target vessel failure at 2 years were lower in
LAD than in non-LAD vessels (0.82 vs. 0.88).
In the present study, use of ICI during the index PCI was not associated with higher post-PCI FFR values when compared with cases
guided by angiography alone. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) or optical coherence tomography (OCT) was utilized in 16.2% (42/260) of
PCI procedures, which exceeds the UK national average of 10.7% in
2018/19. The DOCTORS study previously randomized 240 patients
with non-ST-elevation ACS to either OCT- or angiography-guided
PCI and reported a marginally higher post-PCI FFR in the OCT arm
(0.94 +/- 0.04 vs. 0.92 +/- 0.05, P = 0.005).31 It is worth noting that observational data from a number of non-randomized studies in which
IVUS was routinely used before and after PCI7,11,18 have reported
mean/median post-PCI FFR values within the same range as those
from cohorts with lower rates of adjunctive ICI than in TARGETFFR.9,13,25

Even well-expanded stents manifest a pressure gradient during
maximal hyperaemia. In TARGET-FFR, we theorized that a transstent gradient of >0.05 FFR units would be of sufficient magnitude to
actually detect change/improvement related to additional postdilation of the stent. Yang et al.32 have reported that trans-stent gradients >_0.04 FFR units are associated with increased rates of MACE.
The authors found that despite successful, IVUS-assessed PCI, 98.5%
of stents in their study had a HTG >0, with single stents having a
mean HTG of 0.03 +/- 0.02 and overlapping stents a mean of
0.05 +/- 0.02. These findings support our hypothesis that intervening
on stents with HTG <0.05 units would have been unlikely to achieve
an appreciable change in final FFR.
Currently, there are no generally accepted definitions of focal or
diffuse disease with respect to pressure-wire pullback curves. To
date, such definitions have been arbitrary, vary from study to study,
and are often very much in the eye of the beholder. The DEFINE PCI
study examined post-PCI instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR) pullbacks and arbitrarily categorized trans-stenotic pressure gradients
>_0.03 iFR units as focal lesions when their length was <_15 mm, and as
diffuse disease when their length exceeded 15 mm.33 Fifteen millimetres is not an insignificant length of vessel and a plausible argument
could be made that a relatively small pressure loss (0.03 units) over
such length should be considered diffuse. Adopting such a broad definition of focality led the authors to the unprecedented conclusion
that 81.6% of patients with post-PCI iFR <0.90 had 'focal' residual disease. The signal to noise ratio is lower with hyperaemic pullbacks
than with resting assessments. Had we chosen to define focal disease
as a gradient of >_0.03 FFR units over 15 mm, the data from Yang et al.
illustrate how a pre-PCI gradient of 0.03 within a vessel could end up
being replaced by an HTG of 0.03 post-stenting. This would achieve
no overall functional gain in the vessel yet expose the patient to the
risk of additional coronary intervention. As one can observe from the
case examples provided in the Supplementary material online, truly
focal lesions cause an obvious and abrupt drop in pressure.
Accordingly, we felt that an abrupt pressure drop >_0.05 FFR units
was an appropriate definition of focal disease when utilizing FFR assessment (with anything else being considered generally diffuse).
TARGET-FFR provides the first randomized data on the incidence
of physiologically suboptimal results following standard-of-care PCI
and confirms the feasibility of routine post-PCI FFR assessment. It
found that persistently abnormal post-PCI FFR values are common
and that a strategy of routine post-PCI physiology guidance can safely
and effectively improve the final FFR values in a significant number of
the worst-affected patients. Importantly, larger relative increases in

FFR were associated with a reduced frequency of angina at 3-month
follow-up.
The trial has a number of limitations. It is a single-centre study with
a relatively homogeneous PCI practice, including high rates of lesion
pre-dilatation and high-pressure stent post-dilatation. On average,
FFR is performed prior to PCI in 9.4% of cases in the UK. In our study,
the rate of pre-PCI FFR guidance (including pullback assessment) was
35%. This may have influenced or altered operators' stenting strategy
and consequently reduced the incidence of focal, physiologically significant residual disease post-PCI. A larger multicentre trial incorporating a wider range of PCI strategies and techniques may have had a
different outcome. With just 40 of the 131 patients randomized to
the PIOS arm actually receiving additional optimization measures, the
study was ultimately underpowered to detect a significant betweengroup difference for its primary endpoint. Excluding patients with
post-PCI FFR >_0.90 (29% of the PIOS group) from randomization
would have increased the power for the primary endpoint but overestimated the effect physicians could expect from measuring postPCI physiology. Ultimately, TARGET-FFR was a trial of a strategy of
routine post-PCI FFR assessment vs. standard of care, without selection based on the post-PCI FFR value. This approach permits an
evaluation of the effects of the PIOS intervention, regardless of the
baseline post-PCI FFR. By randomizing all-comers, the design allowed
a comprehensive, and generalizable evaluation of the effects of
physiology-guided PCI optimization. The incidence of target vessel
failure at a median follow-up of 2 years was very low and the study
was not powered for clinical outcomes. Larger randomized trials
would be required to test if physiology-guided optimization of PCI
results can improve patient outcomes compared with standard
angiographic assessment alone.
