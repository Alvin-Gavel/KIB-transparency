Aims

The aim of this study was to test whether current and past night shift work was associated with incident atrial fibrillation (AF) and whether this association was modified by genetic vulnerability. Its associations with coronary
heart disease (CHD), stroke, and heart failure (HF) were measured as a secondary aim.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods and
This cohort study included 283 657 participants in paid employment or self-employed without AF and 276 009 parresults
ticipants free of CHD, stroke, and HF at baseline in the UK Biobank. Current and lifetime night shift work information was obtained. Cox proportional hazard models were used. Weighted genetic risk score for AF was calculated.
During a median follow-up of 10.4 years, 5777 incident AF cases were documented. From 'day workers', 'shift but
never/rarely night shifts', and 'some night shifts' to 'usual/permanent night shifts', there was a significant increasing
trend in the risk of incident AF (P for trend 0.013). Usual or permanent night shifts were associated with the highest risk [hazard ratio (HR) 1.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.32]. Considering a person's lifetime work
schedule and compared with shift workers never working nights, participants with a duration over 10 years and an
average 3-8 nights/month frequency of night shift work exposure possessed higher AF risk (HR 1.18, 95% CI 0.99-
1.40 and HR 1.22, 95% CI 1.02-1.45, respectively). These associations between current and lifetime night shifts and
AF were not modified by genetic predisposition to AF. Usual/permanent current night shifts, >_10 years and 3-8
nights/month of lifetime night shifts were significantly associated with a higher risk of incident CHD (HR 1.22, 95%
CI 1.11-1.35, HR 1.37, 95% CI 1.20-1.58 and HR 1.35, 95% CI 1.18-1.55, respectively). These associations in
stroke and HF were not significant.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
Both current and lifetime night shift exposures were associated with increased AF risk, regardless of genetic AF

risk. Night shift exposure also increased the risk of CHD but not stroke or HF. Whether decreasing night shift
work frequency and duration might represent another avenue to improve heart health during working life and beyond warrants further study.

Introduction
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent arrhythmia managed in
clinical practice and often occurs as a cause or consequence of heart
failure (HF).1 The 2017 Global Burden of Disease Study showed that
there were 37.6 million individuals with AF worldwide, including 3
million people with new-onset AF and 287 000 people who died
from AF in 2017.2 The American Heart Association stated that the
primary and secondary prevention of AF through intervention in lifestyle and risk factors was essential.3 Several risk factors such as obesity, sleep apnoea, hypertension, diabetes and other modifiable
lifestyle-related factors have been associated with the occurrence of
AF.4,5 Considering the increasing prevalence of AF, novel risk factors
should be studied.
With the intensification of social production pressure and the refinement of the division of labour, shift work is gradually becoming
common among employees in modern society.6 According to the
6th European Working Conditions Survey, nearly 21% of the working
population engaged in shift work, which is identified as an irregular
working schedule outside the conventional daytime, often classified
into daily, night, rotating and other types of shift work.7 Growing evidence indicates that shift work, particularly night shift work, has an
adverse impact on individual health and organ function.8 Night shift
work may break the body's circadian rhythm and affect metabolism

and hormone secretion,9 and the effect may be more significant with
long-term night shift exposure. Several investigations have focused
on the relationship of night shift work with metabolic and cardiovascular disease10-12 and emphasize the important role of the lifetime
duration of night shift work.13 Thus, night shifts have been associated
with various changes in metabolism and the autonomic system that
are likely to be related to AF;14,15 however, data on the association of
night shifts with AF are lacking.
Besides environmental factors, genetic risk plays a role in the development of AF. A recent genome-wide association study identified
140 loci associated with AF.16 Genetic predisposition may modify
the association between environmental factors and cardiometabolic
diseases;17 however, little is known about the potential interaction
between genetic risk and night shift on AF risk.
Using this cohort of 283 657 participants from the UK Biobank
(UKB), our objective was to test whether current night shift work
was associated with AF. According to lifetime employment reports,
we examined whether a longer duration of and more frequent night
shift work were associated with a higher AF risk. We further analysed
the effect of the interaction between night shift work and genetic AF
predisposition on disease risk. In addition, the association between
night shift exposure and cardiovascular diseases including coronary
heart disease (CHD), stroke and HF was also measured as a secondary aim.

This study demonstrates that both current and lifetime night shift exposures were associated with increased risk of atrial fibrillation and coronary heart
disease.

Materials and methods
Study design and population

Shift work assessment
Participants who indicated they were in paid employment or selfemployed were asked whether their current work involved shift work.
'Shift work is a work schedule that falls outside of the normal daytime
working hours of 9 a.m.-5 p.m. This may involve working afternoons, evenings or nights or rotating through these kinds of shifts'. The answers
included 'never/rarely, sometimes, usually, and always' and additional
options: 'prefer not to answer' and 'do not know'. Those who answered
'sometimes, usually, and always' were further asked whether their work
involved night shift work that 'is a work schedule involving working
through the normal sleeping hours, for instance working through the
hours from 12 a.m. to 6 a.m.'. The answer options were the same as
above. As suggested in previous studies,12 current shift work status was
categorized as 'day workers', 'shift but never/rarely night shifts', 'some
night shifts', and 'usual/permanent night shifts'.
In the lifetime employment questionnaire, participants provided
detailed information about each job ever worked, the number of years in
each job, and the number of night shifts per month for each job. The lifetime employment information before the baseline in each participant was
selected. Suggested by previous studies,12 using that information, we calculated the duration (i.e. number of years working night shifts) and frequency (i.e. the average number of night shifts per month) of night shift
work.

Ascertainment of atrial fibrillation
The outcome, incident AF (field ID 131351, ICD code I48), was extracted
from the 'first occurrence of health outcomes defined by a three-character International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health
Problems 10th Revision code' (category ID in UKB 1712). The diagnosis
of AF was obtained by using linkage with death register, primary care, and
hospital inpatient records. Detailed information regarding the linkage
procedure is available online (https://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/exinfo.
cgi?src=diag_xtabs_HES, last accessed date 24 July 2021). How to ascertain CHD, stroke and HF is shown in the Supplementary material online.

..
.. Genetic risk score for atrial fibrillation
.. Detailed information on genotyping in the UKB was reported previous.. 20
.. ly. The weighted genetic risk score (GRS) was created for AF using sin.. gle-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with AF at the genome.. wide association significance in a meta-analysis of genome-wide associ..
.. ation studies that did not include UKB participants.16 Information on the
.. 166 selected SNPs is listed in Supplementary material online, Table S1.
..
.. Individual SNPs were coded as 0, 1, and 2 according to the number of risk
.. alleles. The regression coefficient for each SNP was taken from the
..
.. reported meta-analysis.16 The GRS was formulated as the sum of the
.. number of AF risk-increasing alleles at each locus multiplied by the re.. spective regression coefficient.21 We determined whether participants
..
.. were at high (highest quartile), intermediate (mid two quartiles), or low
.. (lowest quartile) genetic risk for AF.
..
..
.. Covariates
..
.. Three main groups of covariates were considered. One group was demo.. graphic information, including age, sex, ethnicity (white/others), education
.. (university or college degree/others), and the Townsend index reflecting
..
.. socioeconomic status (continuous).
..
The second group included seven ideal cardiovascular health metrics
..
.. (ICVHMs) proposed by the American Heart Association, which are well.. defined cardiometabolic health metrics and are potential confounders in
..
.. the associations explored.22 The ideal metrics were binomial variables
.. including never or quit smoking, ideal body mass index (BMI <25.0 kg/
.. m2), physical activity goal (>_150 min/week of moderate intensity,
..
.. >_75 min/week of vigorous intensity, or an equivalent combination), diet.. ary score >_4 proposed in previous studies,23 total cholesterol
..
.. <5.18 mmol/L without using lipid-lowering medication, glycated haemo.. globin <5.7% (39 mmol/mol), and no history of diabetes and blood pres.. sure <120/<80 mmHg without using blood pressure-lowering
..
.. medication.
..
The third group contained two sleep factors obtained from the self..
.. reported sleep questionnaire including sleep duration (<_6, 7-8, and >_9 h/
.. day) and chronotype preference [morning type (a 'morning' person),
.. intermediate type (more a 'morning' than 'evening' person, or more an
..
.. 'evening' than 'morning' person), and evening type (an 'evening' person)].
..
..
.. Statistical analyses
.. Data analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics, version 25 (IBM
..
.. Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA). A P-value of <0.05 indicated statistical
.. significance (two-sided). The baseline characteristics of the study popula..
.. tion are reported as the means or percentages by current shift work sta.. tus ('day workers', 'shift but never/rarely night shifts', 'some night shifts',
.. and 'usual/permanent night shifts'). For lifetime employment, we exam..
.. ined the associations of cumulative night shift work duration (none, <10
.. and >_10 years) and average monthly frequency of night shifts (none, <3
..
.. nights/month, 3-8 nights/month, or >8 nights/month) with AF risk.
.. Cumulative cases of AF, CHD, stroke, and HF were calculated during
.. follow-up visits. The follow-up time was determined from the baseline
..
.. date (date of visiting the assessment centre) to the diagnosis of AF, CHD,
.. stroke and HF, death, or censoring date (31 August 2019), whichever
..
.. came first.
..
The a priori hypothesis was that current and past rotating night shift
.. work
increased AF risk. Thus, Cox proportional hazards models were
..
.. used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals
.. (CIs) in the association between current, lifetime duration and frequency
..
.. of night shift and incident AF. Model 1 was adjusted for age and sex.

The UKB is a prospective cohort study that included >500 000
community-dwelling adults aged 40-69 years across the UK between
2006 and 2010 (https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/, last accessed date 24 July
2021). Detailed information has been described previously.18 We declare
that all data are publicly available from the UKB repository.18 The North
West Multicentre Research Ethical Committee Study approved the UKB
study, and all participants provided written informed consent.
Participants in paid employment or who were self-employed at baseline were included (n = 286 353). We excluded individuals with prevalent
AF at baseline (n = 2696), and then, our sample consisted of 283 657 participants. Among those, 193 819 had genetic data. Moreover, 75 391 participants provided in-depth lifetime employment information by
completing an online follow-up questionnaire in 2015, which was emailed to 330 000 UKB participants with known e-mail addresses, regardless of employment status and shift work at baseline;19 a subgroup of
52 645 participants of European descent also had genetic data available
(Supplementary material online, Figure S1). To broaden the scope of the
research, we also sought to analyse the association between night shift
exposure and other cardiovascular diseases including CHD, stroke, and
HF as a secondary aim. There were 276 009 participants free of CHD,
stroke and HF at baseline; and 73 986 participants had lifetime employment information (Supplementary material online, Figure S1).

In the sensitivity analyses, we further adjusted sleep duration and chronotype category in the models. We also restricted subjects with incident
AF >_1 year from baseline to perform the regression.

Results
Table 1 presents the baseline characteristics of the study population
according to current night shift status. Among 283 657 participants,
'day workers', 'shift but never/rarely night shifts', 'some night shifts',
and 'usual/permanent night shifts' were found in 82.7%, 8.5%, 5.0%,
and 3.9%, respectively. Compared with day workers, participants
who engaged in night shift work more frequently were more likely to
be men, have a higher Townsend deprivation index and lower education level, and work longer hours. In addition, they also tended to
have shorter sleep durations and later chronotypes. The baseline
characteristics of the study population according to lifetime night shift
status are shown in Supplementary material online, Tables S2 and S3.

calculated with continuous values of current night shift work, lifetime duration, and frequency categories. The association between night shift exposure and three cardiovascular diseases was also measured using the
above final model. In preplanned secondary analyses, we tested whether
sex, sleep duration, chronotype, and ICVHMs modified the association
between current/lifetime shift work and the probability of type 2 diabetes
using a log likelihood ratio test to compare models with and without
cross-product interaction terms.
To estimate the population-level risk attributable to night shift work,
the hypothetical population attributable risk (PAR%) was calculated. It is
an estimate of the proportion of the incident AF in the study population
during follow-up that theoretically would be prevented if all people were
in the low-risk groups, assuming a causal relationship.24
We measured whether genetic susceptibility to AF modified the association between current and lifetime night shift work and AF risk. We first
tested whether the weighted GRS (continuous) and GRS quartiles were
positively associated with AF. Using the above interaction analysis based
on a log likelihood ratio test comparing models with and without crossproduct interaction terms, we calculated the P-values for interaction and
stratified associations for those currently employed and those with lifetime employment information by GRS category [high (highest quartile),

Data are hazards ratios (95% confidence interval). Model 1 adjusted for age and sex. Model 2 additionally adjusted for ethnicity (White/others), Townsend index (continuous),
and education (university or college degree/others). Model 3 adjusted for terms in Model 2 and seven ideal cardiovascular health metrics included healthy diet, ideal body mass
index, physical activity at goal, non-smoking, and ideal blood pressure, total cholesterol, and glycaemic status.

Subsamples with lifetime employment information seemed to have
lower BMI than those without lifetime employment information, and
the main characteristics were comparable between the samples
with and without genetic samples (Supplementary material online,
Table S4).
During a median follow-up of 10.4 years (3.0 million personyears), a total of 5777 incident AF cases were observed. We first
tested the association of current night shift work status and AF (Table
2). Compared with day workers, increasing categories of night shifts
were associated with a higher risk of incident AF in age- and sexadjusted models (P for trend 0.001), and rotating shifts with usual or
permanent night shifts had the highest risk (HR 1.16, 95% CI 1.02-
1.32). In addition, this association was still significant after adjusting
for demographic variables including ethnicity, Townsend index, and
education in Model 2. In the final model, multivariable adjustment for
known AF risk factors including seven ICVHMs attenuated this estimate; nevertheless, a significant positive trend still existed between
current night shift and AF risk (P for trend 0.013).
Across categories of lifetime years of rotating night shift work, we
then examined associations between lifetime night shift duration and
AF risk (n = 75 391; 1301 cases) (Table 3). The results suggested that
longer night shift work exposure was associated with a higher risk of
AF in the final model (P for trend 0.085). The multivariable adjustment model showed a significant association between >_10 years of

night shift work exposure and AF risk (HR 1.18, 95% CI 0.99-1.40).
When restricting participants with incident AF >_1 year from the
baseline, the above association was stronger (HR 1.21, 95% CI 1.01-
1.45 for >_10 years of night shift work) (Supplementary material online, Table S5).
Although the age- and sex-adjusted model suggested that more
frequent night shift work exposure was associated with higher AF
risk (P for trend 0.098) (Table 4), multivariable adjustment attenuated
this association. In multivariate-adjusted models, only participants
who worked an average of 3-8 nights/month had a significantly higher
likelihood of AF than individuals who never worked night shifts
(Model 3, HR 1.22, 95% CI 1.02-1.45) whereas the results were not
significant in participants with <3 or >8 nights/month (HR 0.88, 95%
CI 0.64-1.21 and HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.86-1.28, respectively).
The above associations in CHD, stroke, and HF are shown in
Figure 1. Usual/permanent current night shifts were significantly associated with a higher risk of CHD (HR 1.22, 95% CI 1.11-1.35). There
were also significant associations between >_10 years and 3-8 nights/

AF and CHD in this cohort, respectively, will not have occurred if all
participants had no shift work exposure. The PAR% of >_10 years lifetime duration and >_3 nights/month of night shift work was 1.7% (95%
CI -0.2 to 3.6) and 2.7% (95% CI 0-5.4) for AF and 3.6% (95% CI 1.8-
5.4) and 4.0% (95% CI 1.6-6.5) for CHD, respectively.
We further conducted stratified analyses by sex, sleep duration,
chronotype preference and ICVHMs to evaluate whether there was
a different association between current and lifetime night shift work
and AF risk. A significant effect of the interaction between sex and
lifetime duration of night shift work on AF (Pinteraction = 0.040) was
observed: compared with day workers, for women, >10 years of
night shift work significantly increased AF risk (HR 1.64, 95% CI 1.18-
2.29), but this was not the case for men (HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.87-1.31).
Moreover, the association between the lifetime duration and frequency of night shift work and AF risk was strengthened in individuals
reporting non-ideal physical activity (Pinteraction = 0.045 and 0.022, respectively). However, associations between current and lifetime night
shifts and AF did not differ by sleep duration, chronotype, or other
ICVHMs (Supplementary material online, Tables S6-S8).
As expected, weighted GRS and weighted GRS quartiles were
positively associated with AF risk, and participants with intermediate
and high GRSs had a broadly higher risk for AF than those with a low
genetic risk (HR 1.61, 95% CI 1.49-1.75 and HR 3.43 95% CI 3.16-
3.73, respectively) (Supplementary material online, Table S9).
Individuals with high genetic risk and usual/permanent night shifts,
night shifts for >_10 years, or medium frequency night shifts (3-8/
month) had the highest risk of incident AF in the corresponding
groups. Furthermore, we did not observe an interaction between the
categories of GRS and current night shift status (Pinteraction = 0.704),
lifetime duration (Pinteraction = 0.786), or frequency of night shift work
(Pinteraction = 0.960) (Supplementary material online, Table S10).
In the sensitivity analyses, further adjusting sleep duration and
chronotype category in the models and restricting subjects with incident AF >_1 year from the baseline did not materially change the
results (Supplementary material online, Table S5).

risks of AF and in the multivariate-adjusted model. From 'day workers', 'shift but never/rarely night shifts', and 'some night shifts' to
'usual/permanent night shifts', there was a significant increasing trend
in incident AF and CHD risk; (ii) longer lifetime durations of shift
work exposure (i.e. >_10 years) were significantly associated with
higher AF and risks; (iii) an average 3-8 nights/month frequency of
night shift work was associated with higher AF and risks; (iv) the positive association between current and lifetime night shift and AF held
regardless of low, intermediate, or high genetic risk; and (v) night shift
exposure was also significantly associated with CHD risk but not
stroke or HF risk (Graphical abstract).
To the best of our knowledge, this was the first study to test the
association between night shift work and AF. In a meta-analysis that
evaluated 21 studies with a total of 173 010 participants, the authors
highlighted that night shift workers had a 17% and 20% higher risk of
cardiovascular disease events and mortality than day workers, respectively.25 Our study extended those previous reports concerning
cardiovascular health and focused on whether night shift work was a
novel risk factor for AF. Besides CHD, we found the potential critical
role of night shift work in current employment for AF. Compared
with day workers, increasing more night shifts were significantly associated with elevated AF risk, and an evident positive trend still existed
after adjusting for ICVHMs.
In addition, our findings based on a large number of lifetime employment reports focused on two aspects: duration and frequency of
night shifts. The idea that a longer duration of working night shifts
might be harmful to cardiovascular health has been suggested.26 A
prospective cohort of US female nurses found that 6 or more years
of night shift work may increase the risk of CHD,26 and another study
found that the association between shift work and cardiovascular disease risk seemed to appear only after the first 5 years of exposure.25
In line with this finding, we found a consistent linear relationship between lifetime duration of night shift and AF and CHD risks, and a
duration of 10 or more years might be a risk factor. Regarding the frequency, we found that participants who worked an average of 3-8
nights/month, rather than >8 nights/month, had the highest likelihoods of AF. These non-linear associations were also observed in the
CHD, stroke, and HF. Differences in study design, sample sizes, and
changes in work intensity over time (healthy worker effect) may partly explain the non-linear relationship, which were also found in previous studies.12,27 Few studies provide information on the association

intervention in work schedules might be effective to improve arrhythmia. Because changes in shift work schedules could potentially
reduce such risk and there is increasing prevalence of night shift work
exposure in current society, it is important to consider and further
explore the relationship between shift schedules and AF risk, even
though the risk would be relatively small.
Our study has some strengths. First, this study has a large sample
size of over 270 000 participants and detailed demographic and lifestyle information and medical history collected using a consistent
method. Second, the novelty of this research is that for the first time,
our investigation linked genetic and observational data in a large
population with detailed current shift work and lifetime employment
history. This employment information provides novel insight and a
unique chance to examine the relation of night shift work to human
health and thus provides valuable guidance for the future design of
prevention strategies.
Some limitations also remained in our study. First, this is an observational study, and we cannot demonstrate the causal relationship
between night shift work and incident AF and CHD. Second, there is
the potential for undiagnosed AF events. However, only approximately one-tenth of AF was undiagnosed according to a previous
study,42 and the diagnosis of AF in our study was accurate, which was
obtained by using medical records. Third, lifetime employment information was self-reported; and hence, it is likely to be prone to some
degree of classification error. However, as mentioned in previous
studies,43 the true association could be towards the null and thus
underestimated due to the presence of potential exposure misclassification resulting from such misclassifications. Fourth, the current and
lifetime employment information was assessed at the baseline only,
so this information might change over time during the follow-up.
Fifth, although we carefully adjusted for various major confounders,
bias from unknown and unmeasured confounding factors may still
exist. Finally, this cohort included people of European descent, mostly White British, which limits the generalizability to other ethnicities,
such as Asians and Blacks. The UKB aimed to be representative of
the general population but was unrepresentative in terms of lifestyle
because of a healthy volunteer selection bias.44 Therefore, generalizing summary statistics to the general population should be done with
caution.

Conclusions
In the UKB population, both current and lifetime night shift exposure
were significantly associated with AF risk regardless of whether they
had a high, intermediate, or low genetic risk. Night shift exposure
also increased the risk of CHD but not stroke or HF. Whether
decreasing night shift work frequency and duration might represent
another avenue to improve heart health during working life and beyond warrants further study.

between lifetime night shift and AF risk. Future studies could systematically assess the duration and frequency of night shifts using objectively documented information.
In stratified analyses, significant interactions were found between
sex and lifetime duration of night shift work and between physical activity and lifetime frequency and duration of night shift work. Prior
evidence suggests that women are more susceptible to changes in circadian rhythms;28,29 and in our study, women indeed had a stronger
association between lifetime duration of night shift work and AF risk
than men. In the UKB, participants with higher night shift frequency
seem to have a higher prevalence of physical activity goals, which may
be due to more physical activity from work. Nevertheless, the association between the duration and frequency of night shift work and AF
was markedly stronger in individuals with a non-ideal amount of physical activity. We speculated that physical exercise might improve the
body composition to adapt to changes in circadian rhythm. Overall,
these secondary results require further exploration.
The potential mechanism by which rotating night shift work may
increase the risk of AF and CHD is still unclear. Frequent rotating
night shift work alters the circadian rhythm, causing significant adverse effects on biological functions.30,31 After irregular work, disruption of the adaptability to environmental changes,32 sympathetic
nerve excitement, and excessive secretion of norepinephrine enhance myocardial contractility, increase conduction speed and oxygen consumption, and further aggravate the load on the heart.33,34
Moreover, recent experiments related night shift work to increased
cardiovascular inflammatory markers such as interleukin-6, C-reactive protein and tumour necrosis factor a.35,36 The degree of oxidative stress damage was higher in night workers, which may lead to an
increase in inflammatory factors.37 Then, myocardial cells will also be
adversely affected and link oxidative stress and inflammation to atrial
electrical and anatomical remodelling caused by calcium overload
and delayed after depolarizations, which is typically required for the
initiation of AF.38
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the
effect of the interaction between night shift work and the GRS on incident AF. As expected, we observed that populations with high genetic risk and usual/permanent night shifts or lifetime durations over
10 years had the greatest AF risk. However, consistent with previous
studies on diabetes,12 low, intermediate, or high AF genetic predisposition did not significantly modify the association between current
and lifetime night shift work and incident AF. This means that if the
associations are causal, reducing night shift work frequency and duration might benefit AF risk regardless of the genetic predisposition to
AF. In the low genetic risk group, the null association is likely to be because of the small size.
Our findings have public health implications for primary AF prevention. In fact, primary AF prevention seems to be not well mentioned in guidelines, indicating evidence lacking in this field.39 A
systematic review of 20 million participants explored whether 23 cardiovascular risk factors were also associated with AF.40 Their findings
suggest important differences in the risk factors for AF compared
with other cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, in the primary prevention of AF, some strategy elements different from the current
approaches for conventional cardiovascular diseases may be
required. Our findings, together with previous studies such as
Rauchenzauner et al.,41 are consistent with suggestions that
