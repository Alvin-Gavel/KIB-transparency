Aims

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
In a discovery cohort of 770 index patients with HCM, 12 (1.56%) were heterozygous for ALPK3tv [odds
ratio(OR) 16.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 7.94-30.02, P = 8.05e-11] compared to the Genome Aggregation
and results
Database (gnomAD) population. In a validation cohort of 2047 HCM probands, 32 (1.56%) carried heterozygous
ALPK3tv (OR 16.17, 95% CI 10.31-24.87, P < 2.2e-16, compared to gnomAD). Combined logarithm of odds score
in seven families with ALPK3tv was 2.99. In comparison with a cohort of genotyped patients with HCM (n = 1679)
with and without pathogenic sarcomere gene variants (SPth and SP-), ALPK3tv carriers had a higher prevalence of
apical/concentric patterns of hypertrophy (60%, P < 0.001) and of a short PR interval (10%, P = 0.009). Age at diagnosis and maximum left ventricular wall thickness were similar to SP- and left ventricular systolic impairment (6%)
and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (31%) at baseline similar to SPth. After 5.3 +/- 5.7 years, 4 (9%) patients
with ALPK3tv died of heart failure or had cardiac transplantation (log-rank P = 0.012 vs. SP- and P = 0.425 vs. SPth).
Imaging and histopathology showed extensive myocardial fibrosis and myocyte vacuolation.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusions
Heterozygous ALPK3tv are pathogenic and segregate with a characteristic HCM phenotype.

Introduction

Methods
Discovery cohort-study population and
genetic analyses
The discovery cohort comprised 770 consecutively evaluated unrelated patients with HCM referred to the Inherited Cardiovascular
Disease unit at St. Bartholomew's Hospital, London, UK, and before
2015, to the Inherited Cardiovascular Disease Unit at The Heart
Hospital, UCLH, London, UK. The samples used in this study were collected from 2013 to 2018. All patients gave written informed consent,
and the study was approved by the regional ethics committee (15/LO/
0549). Clinical evaluation was as previously described.15,16 HCM was
diagnosed according to current European Society of Cardiology guidelines.1 Patients with previously confirmed HCM phenocopies were
excluded from the study.
DNA extraction, library preparation, whole-exome sequencing,
variant calling, and annotation were performed as described previously16; variants identified with a minor allele frequency more
than or equal to 0.0001 in the Genome Aggregation Database
(gnomAD)17 (in any population) were removed from further
analysis. The analysis of large rearrangements was performed
using a read-depth strategy (ExomeDepth).18 Prioritized variants

..
.. From 2018 to 2020, ALPK3 was sequenced using next-generation
.. sequencing in 4904 consecutive unrelated probands with inherited car..
.. diac conditions referred for molecular genetic diagnosis at Health in
.. Code. This cohort encompassed different cardiovascular phenotypes
.. established by each referring centre: HCM (n = 2047), DCM (n = 746),
..
.. arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM, n = 435), non-compaction car.. diomyopathy (n = 313), restrictive cardiomyopathy (n = 41), and un..
.. defined cardiomyopathy (n = 121). An additional 1059 index cases with
.. no evidence of structural cardiac disease (channelopathies and aortic dis..
.. eases) were used as controls. The remaining 142 individuals in this cohort
.. had an unestablished phenotype.
..
Patients were referred mainly from centres in Spain, the UK, Denmark,
..
.. Russia, Latvia, Brazil, and Argentina. Ethical approval and patient consent
.. was obtained from participating centres.
..
..
Sequencing, variant filtering, and classification were conducted as pre.. viously described.19 Coding exons and intronic boundaries of 261 genes
..
.. related to inherited cardiovascular diseases and SCD (see Supplementary
.. material online, Table S1) were captured using a custom probe library
..
.. (SureSelect Target Enrichment Kit for Illumina paired-end multiplexed
.. sequencing method, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and
..
.. sequenced using the HiSeq 1500 platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA)
.. following lllumina protocols. The read depth of every nucleotide of genes
.. related to the referring phenotype (including ALPK3) was >30 fold (mean
..
.. 250 to 400). Exons that did not fulfil this standard were additionally
.. sequenced using the Sanger method. Predicted loss-of-function variants
..
.. (frameshift, nonsense, and consensus splice site variants) in the latest
.. reported ALPK3 isoform (NM_020778.5; NP_065829.4) were selected
..
.. for further analysis. Bioinformatics analysis was performed by means of a
.. custom pipeline including software for variant calling, genotyping, and
.. annotation.
..
..
The statistical significance of the ALPK3 variant enrichment in cases vs.
.. controls was tested using Fisher's exact statistics. The enrichment analysis
..
.. was performed in the entire validation cohort (regardless of whether the
.. patients were finally recruited or not) to avoid inclusion bias.
..
To check for technical artefacts in the enrichment analysis, we have
..
.. evaluated their comparability through the quantification of the burden of
..
.. rare synonymous variants in ALPK3tv between every compared group
.. and no statistical differences were observed (results presented in the
.. Supplementary material online).
..
..
HCM probands carrying candidate variants in ALPK3 and none in other
.. genes were invited to participate in segregation studies. Clinical and gen..
.. etic familial cascade screening was performed following written informed
.. consent in those who agreed to participate. All the participating families
..
.. belonged to the validation cohort.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)-defined as left ventricular
hypertrophy (LVH) unexplained by abnormal loading conditions-is
a myocardial disease affecting 1 in 500 of the general population and
is a major cause of sudden cardiac death (SCD), heart failure, and
stroke.1 HCM is most frequently inherited as an autosomal dominant
genetic trait caused by pathogenic variants in cardiac sarcomere
genes, but the yield of clinical genetic testing is no more than 60%,
even in patients with a family history of the disease.2 This gap in
knowledge exposes individuals and families to uncertainty about their
future health and hampers efforts to develop novel disease modifying
therapies.
Alpha-protein kinase 3 (ALPK3), located on chromosome 15q25.2,
has recently emerged as a possible candidate gene in cardiomyopathy.3 Bi-allelic truncating variants in ALPK3 (ALPK3tv) have been
reported in small paediatric case series, presenting with a complex
phenotype of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) often evolving into
HCM with poor systolic function3-8 and common variants in ALPK3
have been associated with DCM and more recently HCM in
genome-wide approaches.9-13 A case report has described a family
with HCM caused by a heterozygous ALPK3 variant14 and ALPK3tv
were found to be enriched in a mixed cohort of patients with HCM
and DCM.8
In this study, we sought to determine the frequency of heterozygous rare ALPK3tv in a discovery cohort of patients with HCM
investigated with whole-exome sequencing and to establish their
pathogenicity by means of burden testing in independent cohorts
and family co-segregation studies. The findings show that heterozygous ALPK3tv cause a severe clinical phenotype in adults
with HCM.

Kaplan-Meier curves for age at diagnosis were depicted with the information on both cohorts (validation and discovery) and were computed by means of the 'survfit' function in R. In Figures 2 and 3, we

Clinical characteristics and outcomes of
patients with ALPK3tv in comparison to
genotyped patients with HCM
Patients with ALPK3tv (probands and affected relatives from discovery
and validation cohorts) with available follow-up data were compared to
adult patients (>_18 years of age) with HCM with an available genotype
and follow-up data, evaluated between 1986 and 2019.
Variants were classified as pathogenic, likely pathogenic, unknown significance, or likely benign/benign using the current criteria of the
American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics.21 Patients with >_1

Immunohistochemistry was performed for desmin and plakoglobin. We
additionally report the clinical findings for a skeletal muscle biopsy (left
quadriceps) and cardiac muscle biopsy (myectomy) for two other
patients (Supplementary material online, Table S3), for whom tissue was
not available to re-analyse.

Results
The discovery cohort comprised 770 patients with HCM, aged
49.3 +/- 15.9 years at diagnosis (median 51.6); 515 (67%) were male;
378 out of 589 where ethnicity was stated (64%) were white; 246
(32%) had rare variants in eight sarcomeric genes robustly associated
with HCM (MYH7, MYBPC3, TNNT2, TNNI3, MYL2, MYL3, TPM1,
ACTC1). Twenty-one patients carried multiple rare sarcomere
variants.

ALPK3-truncating variants
Supplementary material online, Table S3 summarizes the genetic
characteristics of patients with ALPK3tv. Figure 4 represents the distribution of ALPK3tv along the gene.
Discovery cohort
In the discovery cohort, 12 patients (1.56%) were heterozygous
carriers of an ALPK3tv. All these variants were confirmed with
Sanger sequencing. These variants were enriched when compared
to the prevalence of truncating variants in the gnomAD population
(12/770 HCM-discovery cohort vs. 74/75431 gnomAD) with an
odds ratio (OR) of 16.11 [95% confidence interval (CI): 7.94-
30.02; P 8.05e-11]. No copy-number variants in ALPK3 were
detected. Three patients were found to harbour variants of uncertain significance (VUS) in sarcomere genes (Supplementary material online, Table S3): one patient with an MYH7 missense variant

#11). No proband was found to carry a second rare missense
ALPK3 variant.
Validation cohort
In the validation cohort, a total of 24 ALPK3tv were identified in 36
probands in simple heterozygosity, out of 4904 (0.86%) consecutive
unrelated index cases who were sequenced with a genetic library
including this gene. HCM was the diagnosis in 32 out of the 36 probands. The remaining 4 cases had other phenotypes: DCM (n = 1),
ACM (n = 1), restrictive cardiomyopathy (n = 1) and Brugada syndrome (n = 1). From these 36 identified patients, 30 were finally
recruited to this study, diagnosed with HCM (n = 29) and ACM
(n = 1). One patient was homozygous for the truncating ALPK3
variant p.Trp1563* (c.4689delG); this case was not included in the enrichment analysis (where only heterozygous variants were analysed).
The prevalence of ALPK3tv found in simple heterozygosity was significantly higher in the HCM cohort (32/2047; 1.56%) than in disease
control subjects/non-cardiomyopathy controls (1/1059; 0.09%), nonHCM cases (4/2857; 0.14%) and gnomAD database (74/75431;
0.1%), with an OR of 16.8 (95% CI: 2.79-682.77; P = 2.375e-05),
11.32 (95% CI: 4.01-44.09; P = 8.01e-09), and 16.17 (95% CI: 10.31-
24.87; P = 2.2e-16), respectively.
Two of the HCM patients with ALPK3tv in simple heterozygosity in
the validation cohort were found to carry a second variant in a sarcomeric gene in digenic heterozygosis (Supplementary
material online, Table S3) [MYBPC3 VUS (p.Pro677Ser) (#
17), MYH7 pathogenic variant (p.Arg869Cys) (# 39)]. One

case diagnosed with restrictive physiology was also a carrier of a
FLNC variant (p.Gly2011Arg) (# 30). The remaining cases had no
other candidate variant as a potential cause for their phenotype.
Recurrent variants
Four variants were particularly frequent in the discovery and validation cohorts combined: p.Arg1059* (five probands from different
geographic origins, including the UK, Spain, and Latvia),
p.Glu1179Argfs*93 (three probands, all from Spain), p.Trp1563*
(c.4689delG, three probands, from Spain, including one patient
homozygous for this variant).
Three (# 8, # 13, # 14) of the five patients harbouring the variant
p.Arg1059* also had a missense variant, p.Arg86Trp. This fact, along
with their similar frequencies in the gnomAD population, suggests
that these two variants are in linkage disequilibrium and part of a
haplotype; the effect of the nonsense variant usually prevails in these
cases.

Clinical characterization of HCM
patients with heterozygous ALPK3tv and
comparison with a genotyped HCM
cohort
Table 1 and Supplementary material online, Tables S3-S5 summarize
the clinical characteristics of the 51 patients (probands and relatives)
with ALPKtv from both discovery and validation cohorts. In Table 1,
the phenotype and outcomes are compared with sarcomere positive
and sarcomere negative patients.
Demographic, ECG, and imaging characteristics
The age at diagnosis (56 +/- 15.9 years) and sex distribution (69%
males) of HCM patients with ALPK3tv were similar to sarcomerenegative and higher than sarcomere-positive patients.
From the initial WES discovery cohort, 6 out of 12 patients
were white and 5 South Asian. We have stratified the enrichment

The prevalence of voltage criteria for LVH (69%) in carriers of

to asymmetric septal hypertrophy.
Six (12%) patients with ALPK3tv had resting left ventricular outflow
tract obstruction and 3 of 49 (6%) had left ventricular systolic dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction <50%) at baseline evaluation; 3 patients developed left ventricular systolic dysfunction during
follow-up. Eighteen (35%) HCM had >20 mm maximum left ventricular wall thickness and 16 (49%) had extensive myocardial fibrosis

Skeletal muscle involvement
Seven patients had raised serum creatine kinase out of 35 where it
was determined (20%), one of whom was referred for skeletal
muscle biopsy and had myopathic features and marked hypertrophic
fibres with no evidence of inflammation (complete description in
Supplementary material online, Table S4).
Outcomes
Follow-up time for patients with ALPK3tv and HCM was

to the sarcomere-positive population but significantly higher than in
sarcomere-negative patients (Figure 6).

Family co-segregation and disease

ALPK3tv co-segregated with HCM in all seven available families.
Combined LOD score was 2.99, indicative of significant segregation
(P < 0.05).22 The family pedigrees are represented in Figure 1.
The information on the entire cohort suggests that ALPK3tv are
associated with incomplete penetrance until the age of 75 years
(Figure 2), when the cumulative percentage of diagnosed carriers
increased to >95% among males and 80% among females. A positive
correlation was observed for age and left ventricular wall thickness in
females but not in males (Figure 3).

outcome of heart failure death and cardiac transplant between
ALP3tv patients, sarcomere positive and sarcomere negative.
Patients with ALPK3tv (probands and affected relatives from discovery and validation cohorts) with available follow-up data (45 out of
51) were compared to adult patients with HCM with available genotype and follow-up data.

knock-out models show ventricular hypertrophy and impaired contractility.3,24 Abnormal calcium handling has been observed in cardiomyocytes differentiated from stem cells carrying homozygous ALPK3
variants.4
Biallelic ALPK3tv were first identified in five children (four diagnosed in utero) presenting with severe, early-onset cardiomyopathy.
Three died from heart failure between 35 weeks of gestation and
5 days after birth, and two survived up to the age of 11 years with severe concentric HCM.3 Similar phenotypes were reported in other
small case series of biallelic ALPK3tv carriers.5-7 A recently expanded
cohort of 19 patients with biallelic ALPK3 variants, including 9 of the
previously published paediatric patients (10 new probands including
two compound heterozygous adults), displayed similar phenotypes,
with most presenting initially as DCM without LVH and then evolving
to HCM with impaired systolic function associated with extracardiac
manifestations including scoliosis, facial dysmorphism and cleft palate.8 This series included compound heterozygotes with missense
variants, for which pathogenicity is more challenging to ascertain. In
our study, we did not analyse patients with only rare missense ALPK3
variants.
We have identified ALPK3tv in 1.56% of HCM probands and confirmed significant enrichment compared to controls and gnomAD.
This is in line with data reported in a recent publication, where an
increased burden against gnomAD was reported for a Dutch population of 1548 index patients with various types of cardiomyopathy and
a US proband cohort of 149 cardiomyopathy patients, including 129
with HCM (8 carrying ALPK3tv)8; however, the phenotypes of the
heterozygous patients were not described in this report. Importantly,
we have demonstrated co-segregation for ALPK3tv in heterozygosity.
All variants in our study were absent or very rare in gnomAD.17
p.Arg1059*, a stop-codon variant, was previously reported3,8 as a
cause of autosomal recessive cardiomyopathy (p.Arg1261*, in the
previous isoform version). Previously published variants also include
the very recently reported p.Trp1563* (previously published in
homozygosity, p.Trp1765* in the previous isoform), p.Pro804Alafs*4

(p.Pro1006fs*4 in the previous isoform), and p.Lys184* (p.Lys386*)
in a US HCM cohort and p.Pro1385Leufs*23 (p.Pro1587Leufs*23) in
a Dutch patient with ACM.8
Four variants showed a relatively high prevalence. One was the
aforementioned p.Arg1059*, present in five of the patients in our cohort and another two truncating variants were present in 3 patients
each.
Truncating variants were mainly stop codon and frameshift, with
only 1 splice-site variant identified. ALPK3tv were mainly present in
the largest exons 5 and 6, but were also additionally scattered
throughout the gene, including distinct functional domains. No truncating variants were found in the last exon. These data suggest haploinsufficiency due to RNA nonsense mediated decay as the main
mechanism of pathology.
To date, clinical descriptions of heterozygous carriers of ALPK3tv
have shown variable findings with only 5 of 37 previously published
heterozygous carriers fulfilling HCM criteria8 and a very recent case
report describing co-segregation of a heterozygous ALPK3tv in one
family.14 Evidence from our study points to possible incomplete (agerelated) penetrance, which is quite usual in most autosomal dominant
HCM genes, and might explain the variable penetrance in smaller
studies.
This study suggests that the HCM phenotype associated with
ALPK3tv is characterized by a high prevalence of apical and concentric
patterns of LVH and a low prevalence of left ventricular outflow tract
obstruction. Almost half of patients had extensive fibrosis on cardiac
magnetic resonance. Although not directly comparable as we did not
perform a quantitative assessment, this still seems to be a much
higher proportion than is reported in large cohort studies, including
the recently published HCM Registry study, where 9.1% had extensive scar.25 The extensive fibrosis was also confirmed in the histopathology analysis.
One-fourth of ALPK3tv carriers was judged to be at high risk of
SCD and were referred for ICD implantation; however, no appropriate shocks were reported during a relatively short follow-up period.
Thus, the arrhythmic risk profile associated with this phenotype
remains to be ascertained, particularly in comparison with other genetic causes of autosomal dominant HCM.
Twelve percent of ALPK3tv carriers had left ventricular systolic
dysfunction at baseline or during follow-up and almost 10% were
referred for cardiac transplantation. The incidence of end-stage heart
failure during follow-up was similar to a cohort of patients without a
detectable pathogenic genetic variant, but survival analysis demonstrated a similar rate of heart failure endpoints when compared to
carriers of pathogenic sarcomere gene mutations. While these data
should be interpreted with caution as the ALPK3tv cohort was much
smaller and the follow-up duration shorter than in the comparator
populations, the higher prevalence of myocardial scar and frequent
referral for transplantation suggests that the risk of progressive myocardial dysfunction is high in ALPK3tv carriers.
When stratifying the enrichment analysis for ethnicity in the discovery cohort, the OR for South Asians was 44.75 compared to
10.92 in whites. This observation must be confirmed in other
cohorts, but it is of potential relevance as some non-white cohorts
including South Asians tendentially show a larger prevalence of genotype elusive (VUS and genotype negative) patients,26 where the discovery of novel causal genes would have a significant clinical impact.

In our cohort, the phenotypes for the single homozygous patient
and for the double heterozygotes with sarcomere variants did not
seem substantially different from the heterozygous ALPK3tv patients.
This is inconsistent with previous publications where
homozygous patients were characterized by a severe form of cardiomyopathy with prominent extra-cardiac features and childhood
onset.
It has been suggested that patients with HCM and no detectable
pathogenic mutations in sarcomere genes are likely to have relatively
benign disease caused by an oligogenic/polygenic predisposition
under a higher influence of environmental modifiers12; the corollary
is that the screening strategies in genotype-negative families can be
less stringent. However, our demonstration that disease in patients
without sarcomere mutations can be caused by penetrant monogenic variants with a prognosis that is at least similar to and possibly
worse than that associated with sarcomere gene mutations, shows

that this is an oversimplification. Relatives that carry heterozygous
ALPK3tv variants should be followed-up in accordance with current
guidelines for pathogenic sarcomere variant carriers.
Histological findings in cardiac tissue reported in two previous
studies from homozygous patients included features such as focal
cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, and subendocardial fibroelastosis.4,8
Immunohistochemistry in one publication showed disrupted plakoglobin and desmoplakin in cardiac tissue, suggesting a downstream effect of abnormal ALPK3 function on desmosome
structure;3 it was also suggested that the effect on desmosome
might partially contribute to the arrhythmogenic trait observed.
We have re-analysed the cardiac tissue from two of our patients
that had a septal myectomy and also observed myocyte hypertrophy and fibrosis without prominent cardiomyocyte disarray.
Unexpectedly, we observed PAS negative vacuoles (indicating absence of glycogen), the significance of which remains to be

There is accompanying mural fibrosis. The surrounding myocardium shows patchy interstitial fibrosis and focal myocyte vacuolation. (B) Low power

myocyte disarray. A dysplastic vessel is visible at the left edge of the field. (D) High-power view of a section of myocardium stained with Masson trichrome. It contains myocytes with irregular central areas of clearing of the cytoplasm to give vacuoles. Some of the vacuoles are traversed by fine
strands of cytoplasm and other contain abundant normal mitochondria (seen as small red dots). Many of the vacuoles, however, are empty. Periodic
acid-Schiff staining was negative. Desmin and plakoglobin staining was normal (Supplementary material online).

Limitations
The cohort of patients with ALPK3tv had a relatively short follow-up,
mostly reflecting the very recent application whole-exome sequencing strategies or the inclusion in large panels as a possible candidate
gene. This resulted in a limited power to confirm the observed
tendency for left ventricular systolic dysfunction and a higher number
of heart failure-related events. The absence of arrhythmic events despite of the high proportion of ICD referrals, fibrosis and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia at baseline and follow-up did not
allow modelling of SCD risk in patients with this particular genotype.
In common with other multicentre studies, the data collection is
inevitably subject to a degree of heterogeneity. Particularly for a
more accurate and quantitative comparison of fibrosis in the cardiac
magnetic resonance imaging data between this cohort and other genotyped HCM patients, a central imaging laboratory analysis should be
applied.
Previously, we have reported that ALPK3-deficient cardiomyocytes
in homozygosity display altered contraction kinetics.4 Further studies
on these models are essential to further refine the pathogenicity of
rare ALPK3 variants in heterozygosity.

Conclusions
Heterozygous ALPK3tv are associated with an autosomal dominant
form of HCM that is characterized by a distinctive clinical phenotype.

determined. Interestingly, we observed a high prevalence of short
PR interval compared to other genotyped patients, which is considered a red-flag for some inborn errors of metabolism causing
HCM.1 We did not observe an abnormal pattern of plakoglobin or
desmin staining.
Only one of our patients had clinically apparent skeletal muscle involvement, but one-fifth of the proband cohort had raised plasma
creatine kinase indicating sub-clinical skeletal muscle disease. This has
not been described in other cohorts, where extra-cardiac findings in
biallelic variant patients consisted mainly of dysmorphic features.8
Histopathological assessment of peripheral (quadriceps) muscle from
a homozygous patient in a previous report showed normal findings in
contrast to that of the heterozygous patient in our cohort, where
myopathic features were described. It is possible that the genetic
location of the variants might generate different phenotypes but
more studies are required to clarify the relation between ALPK3tv
and skeletal muscle involvement.
