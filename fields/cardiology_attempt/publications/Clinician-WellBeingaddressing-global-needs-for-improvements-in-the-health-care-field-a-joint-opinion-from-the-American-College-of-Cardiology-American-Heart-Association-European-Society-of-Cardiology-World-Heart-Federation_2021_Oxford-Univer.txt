"Health is a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being
and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity."
-The World Health Organization1

As clinicians, we strive for improved health for our patients; yet, it
is increasingly clear that our own well-being is an essential component of the quadruple aim: to improve population health, enhance patient experience, reduce costs, and improve the work life of health
care workers.2 Clinician well-being is described as experiencing satisfaction and engagement with work, while also having a feeling of professional fulfillment and a sense of meaning in work.3 Conversely,
burnout is an occupational phenomenon that is defined as emotional
exhaustion, depersonalization, and a sense of low personal accomplishment in a perceived stressful work environment.4 Although
burnout is a sign of clinical distress and a barrier to clinician well-

being, its absence alone does not confer a state of well-being. Rather,
burnout is one of the more extreme negative components along the
spectrum of clinician well-being (Figure 1), and can coexist with other
common mental conditions (e.g., anxiety and depression).

Drivers of burnout and its
consequences
Over the past several decades, there have been dramatic changes in
health care with the evolution of technology, increased regulatory
burden, and the exponential growth of clerical burden, partly brought
about by the widespread introduction of electronic health records.
These developments come at a cost to the well-being and work-life

balance of clinicians. There are several key drivers (Figure 2) that can
influence clinician burnout when the levels are less than optimal:
workload and job demands, efficiency and resources, control over
work, work-life integration (WLI), alignment of individual and organizational values, social support/community at work, and meaning in
work.3, 5 Furthermore, women are under-represented in cardiology
and may have more stressors contributing to burnout due to lack of
career promotion, inequalities in resources (financial), and
disparities in mentorship while working in environments that lack diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging.6
Unfortunately, there are serious personal and professional costs
associated with clinician burnout (Figure 2). Personal ramifications of
burnout include higher rates of alcohol abuse, substance use, dysfunctional relationships, depression, and suicide.7-10 Although mental
health conditions can occur along the spectrum of burnout, it is important to recognize that not all burned out clinicians will develop
mental health conditions, and not all clinicians with mental health
conditions will experience burnout. Professional ramifications of clinician burnout include higher rates of medical errors, lower quality of
care, decreased patient satisfaction, increased disruptive behavior,
and loss of professionalism accompanied by a decreased level of empathy.3, 5, 11-14 Health system expenditures related to the burnout of
staff are steep when taking into account institutional costs due to
decreased productivity and increased clinician turnover.15-18 In the
past year, the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has caused additional strain on clinicians through increased patient mortality, personal and family safety concerns, fear of the unknown, and increased
work demands. Although clinician well-being is now openly discussed
in the media, the stigma of seeking mental health counseling among
clinicians remains.
Assessing burnout and its drivers by conducting surveys is a critical
step to understanding the factors that need to be addressed to cultivate an engaged and efficient workforce and to mitigate clinician

burnout. Hence, burnout is a metric to measure and monitor, whereas clinician well-being is the goal in cardiology and medicine. With this
joint opinion, the American College of Cardiology (ACC), American
Heart Association (AHA), European Society of Cardiology (ESC), and
World Heart Federation call for global action in health care reform,
research, and policy development to address clinician well-being.
Further, we aim to generate awareness about the impact of burnout
and potential solutions to improve clinician well-being in cardiovascular medicine.

Cardiology burnout data
Survey data among 2,274 U.S. cardiologists and fellows-in-training
reported that more than one-quarter reported being burned out and
almost 50% were stressed; only 23.7% reported that they were
enjoying their work. Women reported burnout more frequently
compared with men. Also, midcareer cardiologists more frequently
reported burnout compared with fellows-in-training and early- or
late-career cardiologists. Neither type of practice setting nor type of
cardiovascular subspeciality had an impact on burnout, but burnedout respondents did report more time spent in direct clinical practice. Overall, most were satisfied with their career; however, burnedout respondents were less satisfied with achieving their professional
goals or their desired financial compensation, and they were less likely to recommend cardiology as a career. Compared with their peers,
burned-out physicians were less likely to report feeling valued or
being treated fairly at work. Drivers associated with burnout among
cardiologists include lack of control over workload, a hectic work environment, misalignment of values, and insufficient documentation
time.19 Data among U.S. physicians from all different specialties demonstrated that 39.8% reported burnout and 42.7% satisfaction with
WLI, whereas other data among physician assistants and nurses have
shown lower burnout rates (35.8% and 29.7%, respectively) and

higher WLI rates (65.3% and 55.5%, respectively).20-22 There is a
dearth of survey data specific to cardiovascular professionals; however, the drivers of burnout among cardiologists may likely be
extrapolated to the cardiovascular workforce.

Health care organizational
strategies
Health care organizations have predominately focused on the concept of "fixing the employee" with individual-focused programs (selfresiliency and stress management training) as the solution to improving well-being; however, much more effort needs to be tailored to
systemic issues that affect the work environment. Intentional refinement of practice environments with highly functioning teams within
which clinicians can optimally care for patients enables all team members to find value and purpose in their work and can result in
improved outcomes for the health care organization and patients. It
is imperative for health care organizations to support the psychosocial health of their employees and be accountable for a holistic approach. One such method is the Stanford WellMD Professional
Fulfillment Model, which incorporates culture of wellness, practice efficiency, and personal resiliency domains,23 while also taking into account the intrinsic (e.g., recognition, trust, meaning in work) and
extrinsic (e.g., call schedule, compensation, technology) driving factors that can be modified.
Organizational infrastructure is necessary to provide the foundational means to maintain work environments within which clinicians
may thrive. The burnout and wellness hierarchy model, adapted from
Maslow's hierarchy of needs, provides a prioritized stepwise approach for health care leaders to address clinicians' professional fulfillment: basic physiological and mental health needs first; safety and

security second; respect from administrators, colleagues, and patients
third; appreciation and interpersonal connection fourth; and finally,
resources and time to treat patients and practice medicine fully.24
For instance, some techniques by which health care organizations
could foster a healthy and resilient workforce include ensuring adequate rest and recovery time, supplying appropriate personal protective equipment, reducing systemic inefficiencies and improving
team dynamics, compensating fairly and transparently, and facilitating
more direct time with patients.
In addition, health care organizations need to provide employees
with a structure to allow for confidential reporting of mistreatment
and also to destigmatize clinicians' access to mental health resources.
Hospital credentialing committees need to refine their inquiries into
mental health conditions so that it does not perpetuate a culture of
either under-reporting of mental health conditions or undertreatment
due to the fear of the loss of hospital privileges among clinicians.
Regular assessment of clinician burnout is essential to understand
the effectiveness of implemented strategic pilot projects. Similar to the
concepts of prevention of cardiovascular disease, secondary prevention is achieved with targeted approaches to prevent recurrent burnout; however, investment in primary and primordial prevention is
equally crucial to reduce or potentially avoid burnout all together.

Role of medical specialty societies
Clinician wellness is a broad entity that requires medical specialty
societies to develop a multipronged approach to make meaningful
progress. To support their members, medical societies will need to
continue to provide recommendations to health care organizations
and advocate for meaningful health policy changes. Furthermore, development of cardiology-specific tools that may improve practice efficiency
or clinician knowledge base in a timely and convenient fashion is

imperative. Medical specialty societies are also key in developing a
sense of community for their members. Engaged members of medical
specialty societies often cite global social networks as a recurring
theme for ongoing involvement in societal committees and attendance at national conferences. However, medical societies will need to
continue to expand their initiatives in diversity and inclusion so that
all members feel valued and have a sense of belonging. In addition, the
medical specialty societies will need to consider innovative ways to
deliver educational content and offer networking opportunities, especially in light of resource constraints and increased need for virtual
platforms.
In March 2020, the ACC's Board of Trustees commissioned the
Task Force on Clinician Well-Being to help focus its strategy to
address clinician well-being. Several surveys have been launched to assess the prevalence of and drivers of burnout amongst ACC
members. Member sections are integrating well-being themes in
their various offerings to members, including toolkits, webinars, and
conferences. Recent webinars share cardiologists' perspectives of mental health conditions as well as inform the viewers regarding signs and
symptoms of anxiety and depression, encourage treatment, and provide members the contact information for confidential counseling
resources. Additionally, clinician well-being was incorporated into the
2020 ACC/AHA Professionalism and Ethics conference, and the formal
recommendations were recently published.25
Also, in Europe, nearly 4,000 medical faculty and researchers from
17 ESC member countries in 2018 completed the ESC-sponsored
"Culture and Leadership in Cardiology in Europe" C-Change Faculty
Survey. Overall, cardiologists and research professionals have high
leadership aspirations and a high degree of personal satisfaction in
their work. However, approximately one-quarter of individuals did
not view their institutions as providing the best opportunities for
meaningful work, and one-third did not feel they were supportive of
career advancement. The ESC has been using these findings to guide
future strategic initiatives that aim to provide appropriate support for
cardiologists in Europe and enable satisfaction within their work
environment.
The ACC, AHA, ESC, and World Heart Federation acknowledge
that clinician well-being is paramount to providing high-quality patient
care and are committed to improving the well-being of the cardiovascular workforce.
Medical specialty societies will need to continue to identify and
promote for the reduction of administrative complexities and practice inefficiencies, which are burdensome and hinder professional fulfillment and patient care. Advocating for appropriate initiatives to
improve clinician well-being and mental health resources, while also
influencing the elimination of non-essential regulation and document
requirements, is key. Furthermore, assisting in combatting the stigma
of mental health conditions and the negative ramifications by licensing
boards of a history of treated medical health conditions are crucial
endeavors for medical specialty societies. Collaboration with other
specialties is necessary, including leveraging the expertise of psychiatrists and clinical psychologists. The House of Cardiology will continue to work together and strategize to maintain the well-being of
our profession and keep the meaning and joy of caring for patients.
