Reperfusion therapies and in-hospital outcomes
for ST-elevation myocardial infarction in
Europe: the ACVC-EAPCI EORP STEMI
Registry of the European Society of Cardiology

Reperfusion therapies and outcomes for STEMI

Aims

4537

The aim of this study was to determine the contemporary use of reperfusion therapy in the European Society of
Cardiology (ESC) member and affiliated countries and adherence to ESC clinical practice guidelines in patients with
ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
Prospective cohort (EURObservational Research Programme STEMI Registry) of hospitalized STEMI patients with
symptom onset <24 h in 196 centres across 29 countries. A total of 11 462 patients were enrolled, for whom priand results

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusions
The use of reperfusion therapy for STEMI in the ESC member and affiliated countries was high. Primary PCI was

the most frequently used treatment and associated total in-hospital mortality was below 5%. However, there was
geographic variation in the use of primary PCI, which was associated with differences in in-hospital mortality.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                   

Graphical Abstract

Current use of reperfusion therapies, achievement of quality indicators for reperfusion therapies and in-hospital mortality in Europe, North Africa and the
Middle East. In Europe, about 85% of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction are treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention, while
total in-hospital mortality is around 4%. ESC, European Society of Cardiology.

mary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (total cohort frequency: 72.2%, country frequency range 0-100%),
fibrinolysis (18.8%; 0-100%), and no reperfusion therapy (9.0%; 0-75%) were performed. Corresponding in-hospital
mortality rates from any cause were 3.1%, 4.4%, and 14.1% and overall mortality was 4.4% (country range 2.5-
5.9%). Achievement of quality indicators for reperfusion was reported for 92.7% (region range 84.8-97.5%) for the
performance of reperfusion therapy of all patients with STEMI <12 h and 54.4% (region range 37.1-70.1%) for
timely reperfusion.

Introduction

Methods
The design and methods of the registry have been published.14,15 This
study describes the demographic, clinical, and biological characteristics
and outcomes of patients with STEMI admitted to cardiology centres in
ESC member and affiliated countries.

Study organization
This registry is a joint initiative of the Association for Acute
CardioVascular Care (ACVC) and the European Association of
Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions (EAPCI) under the umbrella
of the ESC EURObservational Research Programme (EORP). In each
country, centres with and without PCI facilities were invited to participate. Each centre was asked to enrol at least 30 and up to 60 consecutive
patients presenting with STEMI in the community within 24 h after symptom onset.
The study complies with the Declaration of Helsinki, the locally
appointed ethics committees approved the research protocol, and
informed consent was obtained from all subjects (or their legally authorized representatives).

Patients
Patients aged >18 years with an initial diagnosis of STEMI according to the
2012 ESC STEMI guidelines admitted within 24 h after symptom onset
were identified on admission to the hospital, in the emergency room, or
directly in the catherization laboratory and given a unique study number.

Data
Baseline data included demographics, patient history, and risk factors.
Reperfusion therapies, time intervals, and the reasons why reperfusion
was not utilized were also collected. Angiographic data and details of the
revascularization procedures were collected. Medications given in the
pre-hospital phase, during hospitalization, and at discharge were documented. Follow-up for clinical events was performed until hospital
discharge.

Regions
To compare characteristics, treatments, and outcomes between different
regions, the entire cohort was divided into seven regions according to
the definition of the World Health Organization: Northern Europe
(Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Ireland, Lithuania), Eastern Europe (Armenia,
Czech Republic, Georgia, Hungary, Kyrgyzstan, Poland, Romania, Russia,
Slovakia) Western Europe (Austria, Germany), Southern Europe
(Albania, Greece. Italy, Kosovo, Malta, Montenegro, Portugal, Serbia,
Spain), Africa (Egypt), Middle East (Israel), and non-ESC-Middle East (Iran,
Iraq, Saudi Arabia).15

Definitions
Cardiogenic shock was defined according to the ESC STEMI guidelines.1
Bleeding complications were classified according to the Bleeding
Academic Research Consortium (BARC) definition.16

Quality indicators for reperfusion therapy
To assess the quality of care regarding reperfusion therapy, the following
parameters were evaluated:1,17 proportion of patients with STEMI <12 h
who received reperfusion therapy; proportion of patients with timely
reperfusion (fibrinolysis within 30 min after first medical contact and for
patients with primary PCI admitted to centres with catherization laboratories <60 min from door to PCI, for transfer patients: qualifying ECG to
PCI <120 min).

Statistics
Descriptive statistics are used to summarize frequency tabulations (n, %)
and distributions (mean, standard deviation). All the results are summarized overall and by type of reperfusion therapy. For categorical data, frequency tabulations are presented (without missing values if applicable).

Results
From 1 January 2015 to 31 March 2018, 11 462 patients in 196
centres of 29 countries were enrolled in the registry. The numbers of
patients per country ranged from 5 to 1356.15 The baseline demographics of the entire cohort and patients in the seven regions are
given in Table 1. There were variations with respect to age (North
Africa 55.4 years, Northern Europe 64.2 years), female sex (NonESC Middle East 17.9%, Eastern Europe 28.7%), diabetes (Northern
Europe 15.9%, North Africa 40.8%), smoking (Northern Europe
36.8%, North Africa 59.1%), and hypertension (North Africa 37.2%,
Eastern Europe 54.0%) between the seven regions. Anterior STEMI
was present in 49.1% of the patients without significant differences
among regions. The other relevant clinical findings on admission are
summarized in Table 2. Less than 5% of patients presented with cardiogenic shock.

The incidence of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in
European countries ranges between 40 and 140/100 000/year, which
equates to over 500 000 patients with STEMI being admitted each
year.1,2 Despite improvements in management, STEMI remains one
of the leading causes of death in Europe and worldwide.3-5 STEMI is
defined by chest pain or equivalent symptoms and ST-segment elevation or left bundle branch block on the diagnostic electrocardiogram
(ECG) and subsequent confirmation of diagnosis by elevation of cardiac troponin.1,6 The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) has
issued practice guidelines for patients with STEMI, the two latest versions published in 2012 and 2017.1,6 It has been shown that adherence to these guidelines improves outcomes.1,6 The cornerstone of
treatment of STEMI is acute reperfusion therapy preferably with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Previous surveys on
acute coronary syndromes (ACS) within the EuroHeart Survey programme collecting data of ACS presentation, treatment and outcome
in Europe in 2000, 2004, and 2008 and the Snapshot Registry in 2009
showed gaps between guideline recommendations and their implementation into clinical practice.7-10 In addition, wide variations in the
treatment of STEMI between countries have been noticed, especially
in the use of primary PCI. The 'Stent for life' initiative of the ESC has
been created to increase the rate of patients treated with primary
PCI within Europe, the Mediterranean basin and other regions worldwide.11-13 Therefore, this registry aimed to evaluate the evolution of
treatment of STEMI in ESC member countries, adherence to guidelines and outcomes.

Reperfusion therapy
The intended treatment was primary PCI in the admission centre in
7338 (68.4%) cases of STEMI, transfer out for primary PCI at another
hospital in 353 (3.1%), fibrinolysis in 1999 (17.4%), no acute reperfusion therapy in 630 (5.5%), and not determined in 643 (5.6%).
Treatment actually received was primary PCI in 72.2% (country range
0-100%), fibrinolysis in 18.8% (country range 0-100%), and no acute
reperfusion therapy in 9.0% (country range 0-75%). While primary
PCI was performed in over 80% of patients in the ESC member countries in Europe and in 75% in the ESC Middle East, the rate was
around 50% in North Africa and the non-ECS Middle East countries
(Figure 1). In the European ESC members countries, the rates of primary PCI, fibrinolysis and no reperfusion therapy were 85.4% (5955/
6971), 7.6% (530/6971), and 7.0% (486/6971). The reasons for not
performing acute reperfusion therapy in the 1027 patients of the total
cohort were as follows: clinically inappropriate (19.4%), contraindication to anticoagulation/antiplatelet therapy (5.2%), late presentation
(38.9%), spontaneous reperfusion (15.6%), wrong diagnosis (3.7%),
patient refusal (5.1%), and others (12.2%).
The mean time interval between symptom onset and first
medical contact was 221.6 min and the mean time between first
medical contact and primary PCI was 195.2 min (Table 3). Primary
PCI was performed in 61.8% within 120 min after first medical contact. The majority of patients (55.8%) were admitted by an ambulance
or emergency medical service, the remaining admissions were selfpresenters, while 66.8% of patients presented directly to a PCI
hospital.

Medical therapy
The acute antithrombotic therapies used according to reperfusion
treatment are summarized in Table 4. The use of aspirin was over
97% and the most widely used P2Y12 inhibitor was clopidogrel.

..
.. Intravenous antiplatelet agents were given in about 19% of patients,
.. predominantly glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors. With respect to antico..
.. agulation, unfractionated heparin was most frequently used followed
.. by low molecular weight heparins, while bivalirudin and fondaparinux
..
.. were administered only rarely. Beta-blockers were given in 86.4% of
.. patients, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in 77.7% and
..
.. angiotensin receptor blockers in 7.6%, sacubitril/valsartan in 0.1%,
.. mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in 16.7%, and ivabradine in
..
.. 3.7%. With respect to low-density lipoprotein-lowering therapy a
.. statin was given in 96.4% of patients, ezetimibe in 0.8% and fibrates in
..
.. 0.3%. Proton pump inhibitors were prescribed to 70.3% of patients.
..
..
..
.. In-hospital procedures and outcomes
.. Median length of stay was 5 days and ranged between 3 days (North
..
.. Africa) and 6 days (Eastern, Western, and Southern Europe).
..
.. Emergency coronary artery bypass graft surgery was performed in
.. only 88 (0.8%) patients. Additional revascularization procedures after
..
.. day one were done in 11.3% of patients and are listed in Table 5. In
.. addition, 10.0% of patients were scheduled for a staged PCI proced..
... ure after discharge.
In patients treated with primary PCI, radial access was used in
..
.. 4815, femoral access in 3923 and both in 97 patients. Corresponding
..
.. BARC 2-5 bleeding complications were 2.0%, 3.6%, and 9.2%, and in.. hospital mortality rates 1.9%, 4.8%, and 7.2%, respectively.

cardiogenic shock was 10-fold higher than in patients without shock
(35.5% vs. 3.1%) (Supplementary material online, Figure S1).
Mechanical complications were reported in 0.7% of patients. Definite
or probable stent thrombosis occurred in 1.2%, and a re-infarction in
1.0%. Cerebrovascular accidents were rare and mostly ischaemic. A
BARC bleeding complication was reported in 5.8% of patients and a
transfusion was given in 2.1% (Table 5). The in-hospital mortality of
the 372 (3.2%) patients with BARC 2-5 bleeding complications was
15.3% vs. 4.0% in the 11 083 patients with no or BARC-1 bleeding
complications. A total of 2584 (24.1%) patients experienced heart
failure during the index hospitalization. The mean left ventricular
ejection fraction was lower in the heart failure cohort compared to
patients without heart failure (39.9 +/- 11.6% vs. 48.1 +/- 10.3%), and the
corresponding in-hospital mortality was 13.5% vs. 1.4%. Patients with
atrial fibrillation on the qualifying ECG (n = 571, 5%) received primary
PCI in 73.7% vs. 72.1%, fibrinolysis in 13.7% vs. 19.1% and no early
reperfusion therapy in 12.6% vs. 8.8%. During hospital stay, they had
more often stroke (2.8% vs. 0.9%) and a higher in-hospital mortality
(13.0% vs. 3.9%).

Achievement of quality indicators for
reperfusion therapy
The proportion of patients reperfused among eligible patients with
STEMI <12 h ranged from 84.8% to 97.5% in the seven regions (Figure

3), while timely reperfusion was achieved in 54.4% (region range
37.1-70.1%).

Discussion
The major finding of the current EORP STEMI registry is that primary
PCI was the preferred reperfusion therapy in patients with STEMI in
Europe and the participating Middle East countries. In the first
EuroHeart Survey ACS registry in 2001, primary PCI was used in
about 20% of patients, while in the current analysis the PCI rate in
European ESC member countries has risen to about 80% (Figure 3).
This increase may in part be due to the success of the 'Stent for Life'
initiative of the ESC11 and also the very strong guideline recommendation that primary PCI should be the preferred approach for the
treatment of STEMI.1,6 In contrast, the use of fibrinolytic therapy
decreased over time from 35% in 2001 and to about 20% in the
whole cohort and less than 10% in the European countries now
(Figure 4). About 10% of patients still did not receive early reperfusion
therapy, with late presentation as the most often reported reason.
The rate of patients without reperfusion therapy in the ESC member
countries has declined the last 20 years, starting with over 40% in the
first EuroHeart Survey on ACS and <10% in the current study. As in
previous reports, patients receiving no reperfusion therapy had a
high in-hospital mortality, which was nearly 15% in this registry
(Graphical abstract). Public campaigns are therefore still warranted to

the Middle East non-ESC countries to 2.5% in Northern Europe.
Therefore, all efforts should be made to increase the use of primary
PCI in all regions to improve outcome in STEMI. As recommended in
the ESC guidelines,1,6 this can be achieved by creating STEMI networks with clearly defined patient pathways.
The ESC guidelines recommend a time of <120 min between first
medical contact and primary PCI. This goal was achieved in only
about 60% of cases, while only 20% were treated in less than 60 min.
Accordingly, logistics of care should be continuously improved to further reduce total ischaemic time.
Quality indicators for reperfusion therapy were met for over 90%
of patients with STEMI <12 h, while timely reperfusion was achieved
in only about half of the patients underscoring the need for the improvement of logistics.
Aspirin is still the cornerstone of antiplatelet therapy in patients
with STEMI regardless of the initial reperfusion therapy and was used
in over 95% of the patients. Despite the recommendations in favour
of the newer P2Y12 inhibitors prasugrel and ticagrelor in the ESC
guidelines, clopidogrel was the most often used second antiplatelet
agent. The reasons might include limitations in the availability of prasugrel and ticagrelor and cost. With respect to anticoagulation,
unfractionated heparin and low molecular weight heparins were the
preferred drugs, while bivalirudin and fondaparinux were used only
rarely.
Current guidelines recommend dual antiplatelet therapy regardless of the initial reperfusion therapy and 96% of the patients actually
received dual antiplatelet therapy at discharge. Statins were given in
almost 96% of patients, which documents the widespread acceptance
of the low-density lipoprotein lowering as very important therapy in
patients with STEMI.
In patients without cardiogenic shock, mortality was as low as
3.9%, while the occurrence of cardiogenic shock was still associated

help minimize patient-related pre-hospital delays, to reduce the rate
of patient presenting too late to benefit from early reperfusion therapy. Nevertheless, there will always remain some patients who are
not treated with reperfusion therapy for appropriate clinical reasons
such as frailty or severe concomitant diseases.
The increase in the use of primary PCI has been accompanied by a
decrease in mortality, from 7.0% in the year 2000 to 4.0% in the years
2016-2018, supporting the widespread use of this therapy in STEMI,
as also described by others.19
There remain variations in the use of primary PCI between regions
ranging from 46% in the non-ESC Middle East countries to 75% and
98% in the European ESC member countries. These variations were
associated with differences in total in-hospital mortality, from 5.9% in

30 min after first medical contact and for patients with primary percutaneous coronary intervention admitted to centres with catheterization laboratory <60 min from door to arterial access, for transfer patients: qualifying electrocardiogram to percutaneous coronary intervention <120 min).

with a high mortality of 35%. This was somewhat lower than the mortality reported in randomized trials including patients with cardiogenic shock, which approximates 40%.18 Nevertheless, it suggests
that major improvements in total mortality rates can only be
achieved if mortality due to cardiogenic shock will be reduced.19

with participation of 'better' centres cannot be excluded and therefore the reality might be less favourable. The larger European countries such as France, Germany and the United Kingdom did not
participate or enrol a sufficient number of patients.

The findings of this registry imply further steps to be seriously taken
into consideration to improve STEMI quality of care: continuous public campaigns should be performed to raise awareness and reduce
the interval between symptom onset and first medical contact; improvement of logistics should be implemented to minimize delays so
as to increase the number of patients treated with primary PCI within
120 min or preferably 60 min after first medical contact. A further increase in the use of primary PCI could be achieved by implementing
patient pathways within STEMI networks and future research is
needed to reduce mortality in patients with cardiogenic shock to substantially improve overall mortality.
