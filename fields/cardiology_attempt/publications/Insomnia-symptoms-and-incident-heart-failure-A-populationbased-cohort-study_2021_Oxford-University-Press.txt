Aims

Heart failure (HF) is an ongoing epidemic and a serious clinical and public health issue. Currently, little is known about
prospective associations between insomnia symptoms and HF incidence. We investigated the longitudinal associations
between time-varying insomnia symptoms (difficulty initiating sleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, early-morning awakening, non-restorative sleep) and incident HF.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
Data were obtained from the Health and Retirement Study in the US for a population-representative sample of 12,761
and results
middle-aged and older adults (age >_ 50 years; mean [SD] age, 66.7 [9.4] years; 57.7% females) who were free from HF

at baseline in 2002. Respondents were followed for 16 years for incident HF. We employed marginal structural discrete-time survival analyses to adjust for potential time-varying biological, psycho-cognitive, and behavioral factors and
to account for bias due to differential loss to follow-up. At baseline, 38.4% of the respondents reported experiencing
at least one insomnia symptom. During the 16-year follow-up, 1,730 respondents developed incident HF. Respondents
experiencing one (hazard ratio [HR]=1.22; 95% CI: 1.08-1.38), two (HR=1.45; 95% CI: 1.21-1.72), three (HR=1.66;
95% CI: 1.37-2.02), or four (HR=1.80; 95% CI: 1.25-2.59) insomnia symptoms had a higher hazard of incident HF than
asymptomatic respondents. Respondents that had trouble initiating sleep (HR=1.17; 95%CI: 1.01-1.36), maintaining
sleep (HR=1.14; 95% CI: 1.01-1.28), early-morning awakening (HR=1.20; 95% CI: 1.02-1.43), or non-restorative sleep
(HR=1.25; 95% CI: 1.06-1.46) had a higher hazard of incident HF than asymptomatic respondents.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
Insomnia symptoms, both cumulatively and individually, are associated with incident HF. Public health awareness and
screening for insomnia symptoms in at-risk populations should be encouraged to reduce HF incidence.

Introduction
Heart failure (HF) is a serious clinical and public health issue.1-3 In the
USA, about 6.2 million adults are living with HF.3 Among middle-aged
and older adults, HF is a leading cause of emergency department visits,4 hospital admissions, readmissions3,5 and mortality,1 and its economic costs are approximately $32 billion annually.6 Despite
advances in HF treatment and an increased understanding of its risk
factors, prognosis and patients' quality of life remain poor.1 Notably,
about 70% of all cardiovascular morbidities and mortalities are attributed to modifiable risk factors.7 Healthy lifestyle habits, such as maintaining a normal body weight, quitting or not smoking, engaging in
regular exercise, moderate or no alcohol intake, and maintaining a
healthy diet, reduce the lifetime risk of HF,8 and maintaining healthy
habits positively influences or prevents the occurrence of other
major risk factors for HF, including coronary heart disease,9-11 hypertension,11 obesity, and diabetes.11,12 Thus, identifying and targeting
these modifiable factors could reduce HF incidence and HF-related
morbidity and improve the overall quality of life.13,14
Insomnia symptoms, such as difficulty initiating sleep, difficulty
maintaining sleep, early morning awakening, and non-restorative

sleep, are prevalent among middle-aged and older adults,15-17 and up
to 50% of middle-aged and up to 75% of older adults report experiencing at least one insomnia symptom annually.16,17 Individuals with
insomnia symptoms have a 41-55% higher risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary heart disease, and cerebrovascular disease, and
they are more likely to experience cardiovascular-related mortality.18-20 Therefore, an association between insomnia symptoms and
HF is plausible owing to their common underlying mechanisms and
pathophysiology.21 However, these links remain unclear, despite the
extensive review of HF risk factors.1,22-24 Specifically, little is known
about the effects of insomnia symptoms on future risk of HF among
individuals without HF at baseline.
We used longitudinal data from a large population-based cohort in
the USA to investigate the direct associations between insomnia
symptoms and incident HF while strictly controlling for confounding
factors and selection bias. We hypothesized that respondents with
more insomnia symptoms would have a higher incidence of HF, and
experiencing each insomnia symptom individually (i.e. difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, early morning awakenings, or nonrestorative sleep) would be associated with a higher incidence of HF,
compared to that in asymptomatic respondents.

Heart failure
Heart failure was defined as a fatal or first non-fatal HF incident during
follow-up. The HF status was ascertained through respondents' selfreport of a physician's diagnosis at each follow-up wave or from proxy
informants' reports of a physician's diagnosis during post-mortem exit
interviews. For details regarding the survey question and HF case ascertainment, see Supplementary material online, Methods S1.

Insomnia symptoms
Questions about insomnia symptoms assessed difficulties in initiating and
maintaining sleep, early morning awakening, and non-restorative sleep.
Respondents were asked how often they have trouble with 'falling asleep',
'waking up during the night', and 'waking up too early and not being able
to fall asleep again', and how often they feel 'really rested' when they
wake up in the morning. The response options for each question include
'most of the time', 'sometimes', and 'rarely or never'. We defined individuals as experiencing insomnia symptoms when they answered, 'most of
the time' in the first three questions and answered, 'rarely or never' in the
last question, as described by prior studies.29-33 Each insomnia symptom
status was then represented with a binary variable, 'yes vs. no', in the analyses. To examine the quantity of insomnia symptoms, we categorized
respondents based on the number of reported symptoms. This was performed for each wave by summing across the four symptoms and categorizing the respondents into those experiencing no symptoms or one,
two, three, or all four symptoms. Measures of insomnia symptoms were
time-varying; however, in survey waves 2008 and 2012, three of the four
insomnia symptoms' questions were not asked; hence, we carried forward the respondents' last observation for those symptoms. To address
the issue of temporal sequence of events and make the measures of timevarying insomnia symptoms and confounders precede incident HF at
each wave,34 we used insomnia symptoms and covariate measurements
of waves 2002 through 2016 and subsequent evaluations for incident HF
in waves 2004 through 2018.

We obtained data from the 2002 through the 2018 waves of the Health
and Retirement Study (HRS), which is an ongoing longitudinal, biennial,
nationally representative survey on health, employment, income, and
family structure of individuals aged >_50 years and their spouses, regardless of age in the USA.25 The ongoing survey is conducted by the Institute
for Social Research, and its protocol was approved by the Institutional
Review Board at the University of Michigan.25 Before each wave's new
interviews or re-interviews, verbal informed consent was obtained from
all participants.26 Details of the survey methodology and documentation
are presented elsewhere.25,27,28 The 2002 survey wave was selected as
the baseline for the current study because it was the first wave to include
insomnia symptoms questions. Only self-respondents without HF at
baseline were included. Proxy respondents (e.g. participants' family members or other next-of-kin) were excluded from all waves, since they usually do not answer the cognitive and depressive symptoms assessment
questions for the participants. Figure 1 depicts the inclusion and exclusion
flowchart for the study participants. Respondents were censored at a
fatal or first non-fatal incident HF, loss to follow-up or dropout, non-HF
death, or the end of the 2018 survey wave, whichever came first. This
study followed the reporting guidelines of the Strengthening the
Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology.

Statistical analysis
We first analysed the time-invariant and time-varying general characteristics of the respondents at baseline. The associations between respondent
characteristics at baseline and incident HF status during the 16-year
follow-up were then calculated. Longitudinal associations between the
number and type of insomnia symptoms and incident HF were analysed
using a marginal structural model (MSM) approach.49-51 Marginal structural models developed by Robins et al. are a class of statistical models
used for causal inferencing in epidemiology.49-52 Since measures of insomnia symptoms and covariates in our study were time-dependent, insomnia symptoms might influence their subsequent values and the
covariates' values during the follow-up, and time-varying covariates might
simultaneously become confounders and intermediate factors in the association analysis. Furthermore, attrition in longitudinal studies could induce selection bias if there are systematic differences between subjects
that remain in the study until it concludes and those who are lost to follow-up.50 In these circumstances, standard regression methods fail to adjust for time-varying confounding and selection bias appropriately.50,51
Thus, we adopted an MSM approach to minimize or avoid the influence
of confounding factors and selection bias (MSM notation in Supplementary material online, Methods S2).
Two inverse probability weights were calculated to perform an MSM
analysis: the inverse probability of treatment weight (IPTW) to account
for time-varying confounding and the inverse probability of censoring
weight (IPCW) to account for differential loss to follow-up due to study
withdrawal, loss to follow-up, or non-HF deaths. Final MSM weights were
derived from multiplying IPTWs by IPCWs and incorporated both timedependent confounding and censoring adjustments. Final weights were
truncated at the 1st and 99th percentiles to have a mean weight of 1.00
[standard deviation (SD) = 0.30; minimum = 0.67; maximum = 2.55].
More detailed information on calculations of IPTWs and IPCWs is provided in Supplementary material online, Methods S3.
The final MSM weights were then applied to a discrete-time hazard
model with a complementary log-log link using the pooled data (77 107
person-waves) to generate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence
intervals (CIs) for HF. The model predicts the average causal effects of
the number of insomnia symptoms on incident HF. In this instance, since
the measures are recorded in discrete times, employing a complementary
log-log link will generate HRs that resemble those obtained from a
continuous-time Cox proportional hazards model.34,53 The proportionality assumption was tested by an interaction term between the cumulative
number of insomnia symptoms variable and the time indicator, and there
were no violations of the proportionality assumption. A similar marginal
structural discrete-time hazard model was fit to investigate the associations between each independent insomnia symptom and incident HF.

.. Both models were only adjusted for the time-invariant, baseline variables
..
.. because the effects of time-varying variables were incorporated into the
.. final MSM weights.54 Usually, analysing pooled data may bring up a con..
.. cern related to dependence within the clusters (i.e. respondents); how.. ever, it was not an issue in our models since the respondents were
..
.. censored at the initial incident HF.53 Several sensitivity analyses were con.. ducted to test the validity of the weights and robustness of the results
.. (Supplementary material online, Methods S4). The analyses were con..
.. ducted using SAS 9.4 statistical software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC,
.. USA). All P-values were two-tailed, and the significance threshold was set

assessing depression and cognition,38-42 were retained in our analyses because they have demonstrated significant correlations with insomnia
symptoms or HF.36,43-45 The modified CES-D scale in the HRS is the
summation of eight items; however, we removed one item (which evaluates 'restless sleep') from the score to minimize operational confounding46,47 of the CES-D scale with outcomes. The cognitive functioning
score was assessed through a range of tests adopted from the modified
Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status.38,39 A higher CES-D score indicates higher depressive symptomatology, and a higher cognitive score
represents better cognitive performance for respondents. Detailed
descriptions of these two measures are provided elsewhere.27,38,40,48
Moreover, we incorporated one psychophysiological element-pain-
which was assessed if the respondent was frequently troubled with pain.
Finally, time-varying health behaviour variables included smoking status,
drinking alcohol, and engaging in vigorous physical activity.

>_50 years) in the USA. Our robust design revealed direct associations between time-varying insomnia symptoms and incident HF over
16 years of follow-up. Our results showed that respondents who
experienced more insomnia symptoms had a higher-graded HF incidence. Experiencing each symptom independently was associated
with a higher hazard of developing HF during the follow-up. The present findings indicate that insomnia symptoms are significantly associated with future incident HF in middle-aged and older adults and are
potential targets for preventing and reducing HF incidence (Graphical
abstract).
To our best knowledge, only a few studies have examined
longitudinal associations between insomnia symptoms and HF incidence,55-57 and none have incorporated a comprehensive set of insomnia symptoms, accounted for the recurrent and time-dependent
nature of the symptoms, or adjusted for the evolving effects of timevarying confounding factors. The course of insomnia symptoms is
usually characterized by a waxing and waning pattern,15 and they
sometimes co-occur with other health and medical conditions.16,45,58
Thus, any effort to investigate longitudinal associations between insomnia symptoms and incident HF should consider the timedependent nature of the symptoms and confounding factors and adjust for selection bias. Using a marginal structural modelling analysis,
we found that all primary insomnia symptoms were associated with
subsequent HF in middle-aged and older adults. Those previous longitudinal studies that used only few insomnia symptoms and covariate
assessments at baseline also showed some positive associations. For
example, Laugsand et al.57 screened for difficulty initiating sleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, and non-restorative sleep at baseline and
found that the hazards of incident HF during follow-up were only significantly higher among those who reported all three symptoms compared to asymptomatic respondents. Similarly, Ingelsson et al.55
showed that men with difficulty initiating sleep at baseline had an
increased risk of incident HF. Moreover, Newman et al.56 found that

baseline daytime sleepiness was significantly associated with ageadjusted incident HF in both men and women. Taken together, these
findings suggest that insomnia symptoms potentially contribute to HF
development.
The exact pathophysiologic pathways through which insomnia
symptoms are linked to incident HF are largely unknown.21,35
Insomnia symptoms induce a state of hyperarousal during sleep
and wakefulness and are often accompanied by increased heart
rate and decreased heart rate variability, increased blood pressure, and increased cortisol secretion, and could subsequently
lead to the development of adverse health conditions, including insulin resistance, diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease,
and mental health disorders, such as anxiety and depression.21,35,36 The direct and indirect adverse health outcomes of insomnia could then mediate or moderate the pathways between
insomnia symptoms and HF. For example, accumulating evidence
indicates that patients with hypertension, myocardial infarction,

diabetes, coronary artery disease, or other impaired biomarkers
are significantly more likely to develop HF.59,60 Further, experiencing insomnia symptoms results in increased pro-inflammatory
biomarkers,35 which have been implicated in HF development.1
Another potential mechanism that indirectly links insomnia symptoms to incident HF is the presence of maladaptive or inadequate
health behaviours among individuals with insomnia, which are
well-established risk factors for HF.59 Experiencing insomnia
symptoms could trigger these behaviours, which could put individuals on the path of developing cardiovascular diseases.15
Therefore, dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
axis, abnormal modulation of the autonomic nervous system,
increased sympathetic nervous system activity, and increased systemic inflammation could provide mechanistic bases linking insomnia symptoms and HF.21,35,61-63 Most of these mechanisms
are not mutually exclusive and may synergize in concert or result
in a vicious cycle of events, thereby affecting heart health.35

Conclusion
Insomnia symptoms, both individually and cumulatively, were associated with incident HF among middle-aged and older adults. Thus,
these symptoms are potentially modifiable factors that-if properly
managed-could reduce the risk of HF and HF-related morbidity. As
insomnia symptoms can be assessed and identified early and are relatively manageable,16,35 healthcare providers and clinicians should
screen for insomnia symptoms to prevent adverse health outcomes
such as HF and other cardiovascular diseases. Further, since sleep
quality is an integral part of preventive medicine,58 good quality sleep
can be made part of wellness information, in addition to diet and
regular exercise.58 Patients and individuals at risk of HF should be
provided sufficient information about sleep quality and insomnia
symptoms and guidance regarding insomnia prevention and treatment. Currently, several non-pharmacological behavioural treatment
modalities such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia are
available for insomnia symptoms management. Cognitive Behavioral
Therapy for Insomnia is proven to be effective and have longer lasting
effects than medications.16,35 Thus, effective treatment options exist
that should be recommended for individuals complaining of insomnia
symptoms. Future studies could investigate the mechanisms linking
insomnia symptoms and incident HF.

This study has few limitations. Insomnia symptoms were selfreported and subjective measures of sleep. Although the use of
devices, such as actigraphy and polysomnography, can provide accurate and additional data on sleep,44 sleep measures derived from
these devices are less sensitive or specific than self-reports in identifying insomnia symptoms64 and are not feasible in large-scale epidemiological studies. Thus, although subjective perceptions of
sleep might be prone to bias, they are one of the only means of
capturing insomnia symptoms. Further, the survey assesses HF and
most other health conditions through self-report of a doctor's
diagnosis. Nevertheless, these self-report measures are valid in accurately diagnosing health conditions, specifically cardiovascular diseases, and demonstrated to be reliable across diverse populations
in prior scientific studies.1,65-68 Moreover, this study only used the
information provided in the HRS dataset. Assessments of sleep
duration and other secondary insomnia complaints, such as excessive daytime sleepiness, irritability, and fatigability, were absent in
the dataset, and considering these factors would have otherwise
enriched our analyses.21,64,69 Furthermore, we did not know the
prevalence of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) among study participants. Obstructive sleep apnoea could be an essential contributing
factor to insomnia symptoms16 and might have a significant, usually
bidirectional, correlation with HF.70 Although we could not directly account for OSA, other respondent characteristics, such as age
and BMI, were used as proxy measures of OSA. Indeed, current
evidence indicates a strong, positive correlation between increasing
age or BMI and the probability of OSA.16,71
