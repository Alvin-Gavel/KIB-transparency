Aim

The aim of this study was to assess the prognostic value of ABCDE-SE in a prospective, large scale, multicentre, international, effectiveness study. Stress echocardiography (SE) was recently upgraded to the ABCDE protocol: step A, regional wall motion abnormalities; step B, B lines; step C, left ventricular contractile reserve; step D, Doppler-based coronary
flow velocity reserve in left anterior descending coronary artery; and step E, electrocardiogram-based heart rate reserve.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods and
From July 2016 to November 2020, we enrolled 3574 all-comers (age 65+/- 11 years, 2070 males, 58%; ejection fraction
results
60+/- 10%) with known or suspected chronic coronary syndromes referred from 13 certified laboratories. All patients
underwent clinically indicated ABCDE-SE. The employed stress modality was exercise (n = 952, with semi-supine bike,
n = 887, or treadmill, n = 65 with adenosine for step D) or pharmacological stress (n = 2622, with vasodilator, n = 2151; or
dobutamine, n = 471). SE response ranged from score 0 (all steps normal) to score 5 (all steps abnormal). All-cause death
was the only endpoint. Rate of abnormal results was 16% for A, 30% for B, 36% for C, 28% for D, and 37% for E steps.
During a median follow-up of 21 months (interquartile range: 13-36), 73 deaths occurred. Global X2 was 49.5 considering
clinical variables, 50.7 after step A only (P = NS (not significant)) and 80.6 after B-E steps (P < 0.001 vs. step A). Annual
mortality rate ranged from 0.4% person-year for score 0 up to 2.7% person-year for score 5.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
ABCDE-SE allows an effective prediction of survival in patients with chronic coronary syndromes.

Introduction
Stress echocardiography (SE) is an established diagnostic technique
based on the detection of inducible myocardial ischaemia as regional
wall motion abnormality (RWMA). This approach has a recognized
clinical value but it seems unfit to describe the emerging complexity
and heterogeneity of the individual patient vulnerability. Therefore,
SE was recently upgraded to the ABCDE protocol:1 step A for
RWMA, which is the only sign established in guidelines and recommendations;2,3 step B for B lines by lung ultrasound;4,5 step C for left
ventricular contractile reserve (LVCR);6,7 step D for Doppler-based
coronary flow velocity reserve (CFVR) in the left anterior descending
coronary artery (LAD);8 and step E for imaging-independent heart
rate reserve (HRR) based on the electrocardiogram (ECG).9-11 This
approach applies to all types of physical or pharmacological stress
modalities and allows a more integrated assessment of patient vulnerability above and beyond the detection of anatomic coronary artery
disease (CAD). ABCDE-SE allows assessment of inducible myocardial ischaemia (step A), pulmonary congestion (step B), contractile
reserve (step C), coronary microvascular dysfunction (step D), and
cardiac sympathetic reserve (step E). The ABCDE-SE protocol is

..
.. more likely to capture many potential sources of vulnerability of the
.. patient with CAD12,13 than a simpler approach based only on
..
.. RWMA.
..
The study hypothesis was that each pathophysiological variable
..
.. may contribute independently and incrementally to the prognostic
.. vulnerability in the individual patient and, therefore, the outcome
..
.. would progressively worsen with the increasing number of abnormal
.. steps during cardiac functional stress. To test this hypothesis,
..
.. ABCDE-SE was performed in patients with chronic coronary syn.. dromes, referred for clinically driven SE in accredited laboratories14

.. in the network of the international, multicentre, prospective SE 2020

This study recruited 3,574 patients from 13 stress echo laboratories of 5 countries and shows the prognostic value of the new state-of-the art cardiac functional testing with stress echo ABCDE protocol: Step A for regional wall motion abnormalities; step B for B-lines obtained with 4-site simplified scan and
lung ultrasound; step C for contractile reserve with volumetric echocardiography; step D for Doppler-based assessment of coronary flow reserve in middistal left anterior descending coronary artery; step E for EKG-based heart rate reserve.

ABCDE stress echocardiography for outcome

Stress echocardiography
We used commercially available ultrasound machines. All patients underwent comprehensive transthoracic echocardiography at rest16 and
underwent physical or pharmacological SE according to the protocol recommended by the European Association of Echocardiography17 and
American Society of Echocardiography.18 The exercise protocol was
semi-supine bike or post-treadmill. We used dipyridamole dose up to
0.86 mg/kg (over 4 or 6 min), dobutamine starting from 5 up to 40 lg/kg/
min with atropine co-administration up to 1 mg, and adenosine up to
0.14 lg/kg/min over 6 min. In one centre (Belgrade), ABCE steps were
acquired with treadmill exercise, and step D with adenosine (0.14 lg/kg/
min in 2 min) in the same patients on the same day, 1 h after the treadmill
test.
Criteria for terminating the test were severe chest pain, diagnostic STsegment shift, excessive blood pressure increase (systolic blood pressure
>_240 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure >_120 mmHg), limiting dyspnoea,
maximal predicted heart rate, and significant arrhythmias.
Echocardiographic imaging was performed from parasternal long- and
short-axis views, and apical four- and two-chamber views, using conventional two-dimensional echocardiography. Contrast use was recommended in cases of suboptimal acoustic window, when >_2 segments
were not optimally visualized for 50% or more of endocardial length, and
its use ranged from 0% to 40% in recruiting centres, depending on local
lab policy and reimbursement issues. Anti-anginal drugs were usually not
suspended before testing.
Step A included assessment of wall motion abnormalities and was performed in all patients. Wall motion score index (WMSI) was calculated in
each patient at baseline and peak stress, in a 4-point score ranging from 1
(normal) to 4 (dyskinetic) in a 17-segment model of the left ventricle.

..
Step B of protocol included the assessment of B lines with lung ultra..
.. sound and the four-site simplified scan, from mid-axillary to mid.. clavicular lines on the third intercostal space, each site scored from 0
..
.. (normal horizontal A lines) to 10 (white lung with coalescent B lines).5
..
Step C of protocol included the force-based assessment of LVCR as
..
.. the stress/rest ratio of force, calculated as systolic blood pressure/end.. systolic volume.7
..
Coronary flow velocity reserve (step D) was assessed during the
..
.. standard SE examination using intermittent imaging of wall motion and
.. LAD.8 Coronary flow in the mid-distal portion of the LAD was imaged
..
.. from the low parasternal long-axis view and/or modified apical two-,
.. three-, or four-chamber view under the guidance of colour Doppler flow
..
.. mapping. All studies were digitally stored to simplify offline reviewing and
.. measurements. At each time point, three optimal profiles of peak diastol..
.. ic Doppler flow velocities were measured, and the results were averaged.
..
Heart rate reserve (step E) was calculated as the peak/rest heart rate
..
.. from 12-lead ECG.11
..
All steps were performed by the same sonographer/cardiologist with
.. the same transducer for cardiac, lung, and coronary scan-although occa..
.. sionally a different high-frequency transducer was used for coronary flow.
.. All steps were acquired at rest and peak stress. If needed, steps were
..
.. repeated after 5 min in the recovery phase (Figure 1).

..
..
.. Stress echocardiography positivity criteria
..
.. All positivity criteria were determined a priori.
..
The A criterion was considered positive in the presence of stress..
.. induced RWMA (WMSI stress > rest), when at least two adjacent seg.. ments of the same vascular territory of the left ventricle showed an incre..
.. ment of at least one point of segmental score during SE.
..
The B criterion was considered positive in the presence of stress or
..
.. rest B lines >_2 units.5
..
The C criterion was considered positive in the presence of force.. based
LVCR <_2.0 for exercise or dobutamine and <_1.1 for vasodilators.7
..
..
The D criterion was considered positive in the presence of CFVR
.. <_2.0.8
..
..
The E criterion was considered positive in the presence of HRR <1.80
.. for exercise or dobutamine or <1.22 for dipyridamole or adenosine.9-11
..
..
As required by SE 2020 protocol, all readers had passed the quality
.. control for each of the four imaging parameters upstream to starting pa..
.. tient recruitment.15
..
Stress echocardiography response was summarized with a score rang..
ing
from 0 to 5 as follows: score 0 (all ABCDE markers within normal lim..
.. its) or scores 1-5, according to the number of abnormal steps (e.g. score
.. 5 indicated that all 5 steps were abnormal).
..
..
.. Data storage and analysis
..
.. The results for each test were entered in the data bank at the time of
.. testing by each recruiting centre and sent monthly to the core lab with

were that the step was performed prior to specific training and certification for steps B and C, or the test was attempted but data were not
obtained because of technical failure in step D. An additional 54 patients
were lost to follow-up. The final study population included 3574 patients
all studied with the full ABCDE protocol with outcome information.
The inclusion criteria were: (i) age >18 years; (ii) referral for known or
suspected CAD; (iii) no severe primary valvular or congenital heart disease, or presence of prognosis-limiting comorbidities, such as advanced
cancer, reducing life expectancy to <1 year; (iv) echocardiography of acceptable quality at rest and during stress; (v) willingness to give their written informed consent allowing scientific utilization of observational data,
respectful of privacy rights; and (vi) recruitment in centres with systematic follow-up program.
All patients underwent SE testing as part of a clinically driven evaluation and according to the referring physician's indications. Indications
were in recommendation Class I or IIa according to the European Society
of Cardiology2 and/or American Society of Echocardiography,3 falling
into one of the three broad categories: initial test to diagnose obstructive
CAD in patients with preserved ejection fraction, especially in patients
with intermediate pre-test probability of disease (n = 1400, 39%); inconclusive exercise ECG or unable to exercise (n = 452, 13%); and prognosis
assessment or re-assessment in stable CAD, with or without global left
ventricular dysfunction (n = 1722, 48%).
Written informed consent was obtained from all patients before testing. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the institutional
ethics committees as a part of the SE 2020 study (148-Comitato Etico
Lazio-1, 16 July 2016; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT03049995). The
study was funded partly by the Italian National Research Council (Ageing
project) and with travel grants of the Italian Society of Echocardiography
and Cardiovascular Imaging with dedicated sessions during national meetings. No support from industry was received.

patients. Coronary angiography was indicated by the referring physician
based on symptoms, individual clinical characteristics, and non-invasive
imaging results. Obstructive significant CAD was defined by a quantitatively assessed coronary diameter reduction >_50% in the view showing
the most severe stenosis. Images were read by experienced invasive cardiologists unaware of the SE results.

Outcome data analysis
Deaths were identified from the national health service database. Nondeceased participants were contacted directly. Follow-up data were
obtained from review of the patient's hospital record, personal communication with the patient's physician, review of the patient's chart, a telephone interview with the patient or a patient's close relative conducted
by trained personnel, and a staff physician visiting the patients at regular
intervals in the outpatient clinic. To avoid misclassification of the cause of
death, overall death was considered. Assessors were blinded to clinical
and SE results.

Statistical analysis
Categorical data are expressed in terms of number of subjects and percentage while continuous data are expressed as mean +/- standard deviation or median (minimum-maximum) depending on variable
distribution. For continuous variables, differences among groups were
tested with one-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni post hoc
tests for between-group comparisons or Kruskal-Wallis followed by
Mann-Whitney test using the Bonferroni correction, as appropriate. v2

test or Fisher's exact test were used to compare the distribution of categorical variables among groups.
Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and survival
curves were compared by means of the log-rank test. Univariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify candidate predictors for
selected endpoints. All variables with P-value <0.10 at univariate analysis
were considered for inclusion in the multivariate Cox proportional hazards
model. Collinearity was verified for all the models. We used the variance
inflation factors to check the presence of collinearity and, for the multivariable model containing the positivity components, the overall mean variance inflation factor was 1.16. Moreover, values for all the variables were
below 1.4, thus suggesting no evidence of collinearity in the model.
Non-proportionality of hazard was assessed using the Schoenfeld test.
The incremental value of ABCDE-SE was evaluated comparing multivariable models with and without individual steps using global X2 value to
evaluate improvement of goodness-of-fit as well as continuous net reclassification index and integrated discrimination index to assess its incremental value. Statistical significance was set at P-value <0.05. All analyses were
performed using STATA (STATACorp. Stata statistical software: Release
14. College Station, TX, USA).

pharmacological (n = 2622) with vasodilator (n = 2151; dipyridamole,
n = 2112; adenosine, n = 39), or dobutamine (n = 471). Patients with
more advanced ABCDE score (4 or 5), when compared to patients
with lower scores, were more often hypertensives and studied under
anti-ischaemic therapy with beta-blockers and nitrates (Table 1).

The main SE findings are described in Table 2. Figures 2 and 3 show
examples of ABCDE negativity and ABCDE positivity, respectively.
Rate of abnormal results was 16% for A, 30% for B, 36% for C, 28%
for D, and 37% for E steps.
The positivity rate in various centres differed significantly, possibly
due to different referral patterns and also because of the limited sample in some centres that determined a high degree of variability. In
details, positivity rate ranged from 0% to 56% for step A, from 0% to
60% for step B, from 16% to 100% for step C, from 13% to 100% for
step D, and from 8% to 86% for step E (Supplementary material
online, Table S1). Each centre had its preferred stress modality.

the multivariable analysis, ABCDE-SE was an independent predictor
of mortality with scores 3 (HR 3.472, 95% CI 1.483-8.135; P = 0.004),
4 (HR 4.045, 95% CI 1.595-10.259; P = 0.004), and 5 (HR 5.678, 95%
CI 2.106-15.313; P < 0.001). Annual mortality rate ranged from 0.4%
person-year for score 0 up to 2.7% person-year for score 5. Survival
was worse in patients with ABCDE score 5 and best in patients with
ABCDE score 0 (Figure 5).
In the incremental analysis, global X2 of clinical model for the prediction of death increased from 49.5 considering clinical variables
positive at univariate analysis to 50.7 after step A only (P = NS), and
80.6 after BCDE steps (P < 0.001 vs. step A). The increase over clinical evaluation was not significant after step A (after considering clinical

steps B, D, and E (Figure 6).
Adding ABCDE-SE, risk reclassification was significantly improved
with net reclassification index: 23.4% (95% CI 0.26-46.5%; P = 0.048).
Integrated discrimination index was 0.51% (95% CI 0.01-0.94%;
P = 0.020).

Discussion
A higher ABCDE-SE score indicates a less benign outcome. The risk
is extremely low when all biomarkers are normal. In the individual

biomarker analysis, the more established step A is also the less useful,
outperformed by steps B, C, D and E for predicting all-cause death.
Prognostically meaningful indices such as HRR and B lines are also
very simple to obtain and analyse. Step B requires basic 2D technology and a minimal training, acquisition, and analysis time. Step E is
imaging independent and automatically read in real time on the monitor of the echocardiographic machine. The value of ABCDE approach is coherent with the current understanding of the
pathophysiological complexity of CAD. The individual patient with
CAD may have multiple vulnerabilities, which are ignored, and
missed, by the conventional step A approach. With ABCDE, the
focus is shifted from coronary stenoses to the patient as a whole,
with a simultaneous assessment of multiple vulnerabilities, from coronary microvascular dysfunction19 to cardiac autonomic unbalance.20
It is conceivable that an SE-driven tailored therapy might be effective
in improving prognosis through targeted efforts against the abnormal
steps, which may trigger specific countermeasures. ABCDE-SE
changes the binary step A response in a refined stratification of the
overall level of risk, with a better identification of the prevailing
phenotype coming into play in a specific patient.

showing the diagnostic and prognostic values of step B,5,21 step C,6

The use of the ABCDE protocol is not mainly intended for the primary detection of CAD, since epicardial artery stenosis is the target of
step A. However, the presence of advanced ABCDE score, even with
normal step A, points to more extensive anatomic CAD in patients
with chronic coronary syndromes. Patients with chest pain and CAD
may show pulmonary congestion, reduced LVCR, a reduced CFVR,
and blunted HRR in the absence of RWMA. A similar pattern can be
found, even more frequently, in patients with chest pain with angiographically normal coronary arteries. The reassuring view of the classical ischaemic cascade with RWMA as the early and often only
marker of inducible ischaemia is clearly challenged by these findings.
The main applications of ABCDE-SE are the identification of functional mechanisms of disease and symptoms, risk stratification, guide
to therapy, or objective assessment of therapy efficacy. Each step
identifies a specific phenotype, a biomarker of risk, and a potential selective target of tailored therapy.
An abnormal step A indicates anti-ischaemic therapy with betablockers, calcium channel blockers or nitrates, and possibly revascularization.2 Diuretic therapy is recommended in patients with pulmonary congestion,2 which is optimally identified and quantified with an
abnormal step B after stress. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are recommended in patients with asymptomatic left ventricular
dysfunction after myocardial infarction,2 but dysfunction is better
identified with contractile reserve in step C. A selectively abnormal

the acquisition of step D for LAD flow. This parameter was recommended with vasodilator stress echo since 200917 and is already present in the 2019 European Society of Cardiology guidelines on
chronic coronary syndromes for the assessment of coronary microvascular dysfunction in patients with ischaemia and normal coronary
arteries.2 The next step for those willing to try and start is to put together this information in the clinical arena and to build their own experience in their own patients.
The original statistical plan was to include 5000 patients with 3year follow-up for mortality analysis, but as already described for
many studies, COVID-19 pandemic abruptly slowed the recruitment
everywhere at the beginning of 2020,28 which was the planned last
year of the SE 2020 study.
The outcome endpoint was all-cause death, which is a methodologically sound and clinically meaningful indicator but does not allow
a separate analysis for different causes of death. In practice, the endpoint death is extremely robust, while the adjudication of cardiac or
non-cardiac death, and even more sudden or non-sudden cardiac
death, can be more problematic.29 More granular endpoints may be
preferentially predicted by individual biomarkers: step A predicts unstable angina;3,17 step B predicts acute decompensated heart failure;5
step C predicts progression of dyspnoea class and left ventricular
dilatation;6 step D predicts myocardial infarction;8 and step E predicts
electrical instability and arrhythmias.30
The echocardiographic images were not adjudicated by a core lab
but at each recruiting centre. This allowed a substantial sparing of
resources and was also a methodological prerequisite for an effectiveness study, mirroring real-life conditions with unselected patients.
A mandatory web-based quality control was implemented for conventional and innovative parameters upstream to patient recruitment
since the volume of activity is necessary but not sufficient to ensure
the quality of reading.14
The percentage of exercise, vasodilator, and dobutamine is different in the different subgroups, and this may influence at least the extent of positivity, although we found that the rate of positivity was
similar with different stresses when stress-specific cut-off values are

..
.. used.5 The score 0-5 underuses the potential of stratification since
.. every single letter used to build the score, from A to E, is analysed as
..
.. a binary (positive vs. negative) response but is amenable to further ti.. tration of severity, from mild to moderate to severe impairment.
..
.. These aspects are certainly important and will likely be addressed in
.. the future with larger sample sizes, longer follow-up, and artificial
..
.. intelligence-based data analysis as planned in the SE 2030 study.
..
The overall score generated by the ABCDE protocol is useful to
..
.. identify the level of global risk, with higher scores requiring more ag.. gressive treatment and closer surveillance. On top of this methodo..
.. logical and conceptual framework, further steps can be added in
..
.. specific patients, from mitral regurgitation (step F) for valvular or is.. chaemic heart disease to step G (for gradients) in hypertrophic car..
.. diomyopathy up to step R (for right ventricular function) in valvular
.. and some forms of congenital heart disease.
..
..
..
..
.. Conclusions
..
.. ABCDE-SE allows assessment of multiple different vulnerabilities of
..
.. the patient above and beyond epicardial artery stenosis.
.. Vulnerabilities include pulmonary congestion, reduced contractile re..
.. serve, coronary microvascular dysfunction, and cardiac autonomic
.. unbalance. This spectrum of phenotypes identifies the individual risk
..
.. more accurately than inducible ischaemia and RWMA. Each step is
..
.. important in modulating outcome and is a potential selective thera.. peutic target, paving the way to personalized assessment of risk and
..
.. tailored therapy approaches.
