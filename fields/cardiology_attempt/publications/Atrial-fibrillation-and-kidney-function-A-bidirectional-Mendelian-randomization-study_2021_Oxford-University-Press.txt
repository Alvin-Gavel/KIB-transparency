Aims

The aim of this study was to investigate the causal effects between atrial fibrillation (AF) and kidney function.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
We performed a bidirectional summary-level Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis implementing the results
and results
from a large-scale genome-wide association study for estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by the CKDGen
(N = 765 348) and AF (N = 588 190) to identify genetic instruments. The inverse variance weighted method was
the main MR method used. For replication, an allele score-based MR was performed by individual-level data within
a UK Biobank cohort of white British ancestry individuals (N = 337 138). A genetic predisposition to AF was significantly associated with decreased eGFR [for log-eGFR, beta -0.003 (standard error, 0.0005), P < 0.001] and
increased risk of chronic kidney disease [beta 0.059 (0.0126), P < 0.001]. The significance remained in MR sensitivity analyses and the causal estimates were consistent when we limited the analysis to individuals of European ancestry. Genetically predicted eGFR did not show a significant association with the risk of AF [beta -0.366 (0.275), P =
0.183]. The results were similar in allele score-based MR, as allele score for AF was significantly associated with
reduced eGFR [for continuous eGFR, beta -0.079 (0.021), P < 0.001], but allele score for eGFR did not show a significant association with risk of AF [beta -0.005 (0.008), P = 0.530].

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusions
Our study supports that AF is a causal risk factor for kidney function impairment. However, an effect of kidney
function on AF was not identified in this study.

Introduction
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common heart arrhythmia disease
and affects over 30 million individuals worldwide.1 AF is an important
cause of heart failure or stroke, which leads to an increased risk of
death in AF patients. Due to the global aging trend, the prevalence of
AF is predicted to further increase, and the related socioeconomic
burden is growing.
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is another major comorbidity in
modern medicine with increasing prevalence and substantial socioeconomic impact.2 As CKD and AF are highly prevalent in elderly individuals and share common metabolic risk factors,3,4 the two
comorbidities frequently coexist.5,6 Previous observational studies
suggested that the two diseases are risk factors for each other, suggesting a bidirectional relationship.5,7,8 CKD and AF are considered
to synergistically aggravate the risk of stroke, adverse cardiac outcomes, and mortality.9
On the other hand, because a large overlap is present in risk factors and because CKD and AF commonly occur in elderly individuals
with complex comorbidities, identifying causality between CKD and
AF is difficult. Thus, further evidence independent of reverse causation or confounding, which is inevitable in observational studies, is
warranted to investigate causal effects between CKD and AF. The
evidence would provide information on whether modification of one
may lead to a decreased risk of the other, which would help clinicians
identify targetable causal factors for AF or CKD. Furthermore, the information may guide clinicians to perform early screening for the

Mendelian randomization analysis testing the causal effects between
atrial fibrillation and kidney function. The genetic instrument for
atrial fibrillation, derived from the previous genome-wide association study meta-analysis, was implemented to genetically predict
atrial fibrillation and the causal estimates were calculated in the
CKDGen genome-wide association study meta-analysis for estimated glomerular filtration rate and chronic kidney disease by summary-level Mendelian randomization. The genetic instrument for
kidney function was introduced from the CKDGen genome-wide
association study meta-analysis result and the causal estimates were
calculated in the atrial fibrillation genome-wide association study
meta-analysis result as a summary-level Mendelian randomization.
Replication analysis was performed with the individual-level outcome data from the UK Biobank participants with white British ancestry as an ancestry-specific allele score-based Mendelian
randomization analysis. The negative control groups, those without
the phenotype of interest, were constructed including UK Biobank
participants without atrial fibrillation or chronic kidney disease. If
the causal estimates were not attenuated in the negative control
groups, this would imply a presence of a pleiotropic pathway as
there was no phenotype of interest to drive the causal effects from
genetically predicted exposures to outcome traits. CKD, chronic

anonymous databases or summary-level data, the requirement for
informed consent was waived.

GWAS meta-analysis for AF
We implemented a previous multi-ethnic GWAS meta-analysis for AF in
this study.13 The study investigated >588 190 individuals (65 446 AF
cases) mainly from the AFGen, Broad AF, UK Biobank, and Biobank Japan

.. studies; of these, 84.2% were individuals of European ancestry, 12.5%
..
.. were of East Asian ancestry, 2% were of African-American ancestry, and
.. 1.3% were of Brazilian and Hispanic ancestry (Supplementary material on..
.. line, Methods). The study reported 94 AF-associated independent sentinel
.. variants reaching genome-wide significance with the AF trait by combined
..
.. ancestry meta-analysis. Additional GWAS of individuals of European an.. cestry reported 84 sentinel single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that
.. were in genome-wide significant association with AF. The identified gen..
.. etic variants implicate genes enriched within AF-related pathways, includ.. ing cardiac development, electrophysiological mechanisms, and
..
.. contractile or structural functions. We utilized the reported SNPs as the
.. genetic instrument for AF in this study and the summary statistics as the
.. outcome data for AF in our summary-level MR analysis (Figure 1).
..
..
.. GWAS meta-analysis for kidney function
..
.. The CKDGen consortium provides the largest GWAS meta-analysis
.. results for kidney function traits to date.12 The study meta-analyzed 121
..
.. GWASs including 765 348 individuals, of whom 74.1% were of European
.. ancestry, 23.4% were of East or South Asian ancestry, 1.8% were of
..
.. African-American ancestry, and 0.6% were of Hispanic ancestry
.. (Supplementary material online, Methods). The prevalence of CKD stage
.. 3 or higher was 8%. A total of 264 SNPs that were associated with log..
.. transformed estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) based on cre.. atinine values and replicated in the Millions Veterans Programs data, with
..
.. the lowest P-value in the 1-Mb segment, were reported as the index
.. SNPs. In addition, the study performed GWAS limited to individuals of
.. European ancestry, reporting 256 index SNPs. The genetic variants
..
.. reported in the study implicated genes expressed in kidney-related tis.. sues. We utilized the reported SNPs as the genetic instrument for eGFR
..
.. and the summary statistics as the outcome data for kidney function in our
.. summary-level MR (Figure 1).

.. We utilized the UK Biobank data to perform additional GWASs to iden.. tify confounder-associated SNPs. In addition, allele score-based MR was
.. performed with the data (Figure 1). The UK Biobank is one of the largest

looked up the reported associations for systolic blood pressure17 and
body mass index18 of the SNPs available in the previous GWAS analyses
(Supplementary material online, Methods). The SNPs not reaching the
P < 1  10-5 level of association with the confounders in the results
remained in the filtered genetic instrument. Additional filtering was
applied to the genetic instrument for kidney function, as eGFR determined by serum creatinine levels can be biased by diet or body shape.
We additionally excluded SNPs that did not reach the Bonferroniadjusted significance level (0.05/tested number of SNPs) associated with
the eGFR values determined by the CKD-EPI equation based on cystatin
C levels or those with opposite direction of the betas for the cystatin C
eGFR.19 In genetic instruments for AF, we reconfirmed that the SNPs
were independent by pruning SNPs within a 1-Mb window with an
r2 < 0.001 threshold with the UK Biobank data, which did not identify any

possibility for horizontal pleiotropy. Second, the penalized weighted median method was implemented, which derives valid causal estimates even
under conditions when invalid instruments are present.22 Finally, MRPRESSO was performed, which detects and corrects the effects from
outliers, yielding causal estimates that are robust to heterogeneity.23 The
summary-level MR analysis was performed by the TwoSampleMR package in R (version 4.0.2, the R foundation).24

Sensitivity analysis for summary-level MR
There was partial overlap in the samples for the two summary statistics
implemented in the study (Supplementary material online, Methods),
which may potentially cause bias towards confounded observational findings.25 For concerns of such bias, we implemented fewer SNPs with
stronger (P < 1  10-15) association with the exposure of interests as the
genetic instruments, as previously suggested, to inspect whether such an
issue may alter the results.25
In addition, regarding concerns of different ethnic distributions in the
populations for the previous GWAS meta-analyses, a sensitivity analysis
was performed within the data from individuals of European ancestry.
This approach also excluded major overlap between the populations of
East Asian ethnicity (e.g. Biobank Japan). However, the causal estimates
from eGFR to AF within the European ancestry samples were not performed by this summary-level MR, as the summary statistics of the
GWAS for AF of individuals of European ancestry was unavailable.

Allele score MR based on individual-level
data
To replicate the findings, allele score MR based on individual-level data
was performed and the analysis was restricted to data from individuals of
European ancestry to decrease the effects of multiethnicity (Figure 1).26
Within the UK Biobank data, the abovementioned 337 138 individuals of
white British ancestry passing quality control for genetic information
were included. The kidney function outcome was eGFR determined by
the CKD-EPI equation based on serum creatinine level, which was

.. available for 321 260 individuals, and CKD outcome was not tested, as
..
.. the UK Biobank cohort has a very low prevalence of CKD due to healthy
.. volunteer bias.14 We also tested the eGFR based on cystatin C level as
..
.. the outcome, which was available for 321 405 individuals, as creatinine.. based eGFR is affected by external factors, including muscle mass or diet.

.. The AF outcome was collected from the hospital admission records or

.. ICD-9 diagnostic code of 4273.11 We calculated allele scores for expos..
.. ure by multiplying the gene dosage matrix with the effect sizes of the gen.. etic instrument in GWAS summary statistics within individuals of
..
.. European ancestry by using PLINK 2.0 (version alpha 2.3).27 The associ.. ation between genetically predicted eGFR or AF and phenotypical AF or
..

controls, this may suggest that the exposure of interest mediated the
identified effects from genetic predisposition. This analysis was performed
to support the absence of a horizontal pleiotropic pathway,10 yet, a caution is necessary because of the possibility for a potential collider bias
from selection by heritable phenotypes.29

that genetically predicted AF was significantly associated with an
increased risk of CKD and a decreased eGFR, and the causal estimates remained significant with all implemented MR methods
(Table 1, Figure 3, and Supplementary material online, Figure S1). The

were similarly identified in the sensitivity analysis results by 28 SNPs
with stronger (P < 1  10-15) association with AF through all implemented MR methods (Supplementary material online, Table S5 and

the genetically predicted AF was still significantly associated with an
increased risk of CKD and lower eGFR with all implemented MR
methods by 69 SNPs (Supplementary material online, Table S6).
The genetic instrument for kidney function consisted of 117 SNPs
(Figure 2). After additionally disregarding 1 nonoverlapping SNP and
19 palindromic SNPs, the summary-level MR did not show significant
causal estimates from kidney function to AF by the inverse variance
weighted method (Table 1, Figure 3, and Supplementary material online, Figure S1). The null finding was again identified by utilizing 35
SNPs with a stronger (P < 1  10-15) association with eGFR as the
genetic instrument (Supplementary material online, Table S5)
throughout the inverse variance weighted and sensitivity MR
analyses.

Descriptive statistics of the individuallevel dataset
Among the 337 138 individuals of white British ancestry in the UK
Biobank, the median age was 58 (interquartile range: 51-63) years,
including 46.3% males and 53.7% females. The number of individuals
with AF was 15 443 (4.6%), and their median eGFR was 92.5 (82.6-
99.5) mL/min/1.73 m2. The explained variance in eGFR based on creatinine values was 1.6% (multiple R-squared method) and that in
eGFR calculated by cystatin C values was 1.3% by the allele scores
for kidney function. The explained variance in AF by the allele scores
for AF was 2.4% (McFadden's pseudo-R square).

MR results from individual-level data
The allele scores for AF based on the genetic instrument developed
from the European ancestry population were significantly associated
with reduced eGFR, determined either by creatinine or cystatin C
levels, in the UK Biobank (Table 2). However, the allele scores for
eGFR did not show a significant association with AF outcome. The association was nonsignificant even after we recalculated the allele
scores from the previously reported genetic instrument, including 33
SNPs, which previously showed positive findings for blood pressure
in the previous MR.
The significant associations between genetic predisposition for AF
and eGFR traits were attenuated after excluding individuals with AF,
implying that the phenotypical AF possibly mediated the association
(Supplementary material online, Table S7). When we excluded those

with established CKD stage 3-5, the association between genetic
predisposition for eGFR and phenotypical AF remained
nonsignificant.

Discussion
In this MR analysis, significant causal effects from AF to kidney function impairment were demonstrated by utilizing the largest GWAS
results to date for AF and kidney function. On the other hand, genetically predicted kidney function was nonsignificantly associated with
AF, although the genetic instrument for eGFR explained similar variance as the genetic instrument for AF. Our study suggests that AF
causally aggravates kidney function, but a direct effect of kidney function on AF remains uncertain.
A close association between CKD and AF has been repeatedly
reported by observational studies.5-7,9,30 As the burden of CKD and
AF will increase in the future along with the aging population, treatment of AF in CKD patients has been an important issue because appropriate anticoagulation may be different in the CKD population
compared to those without kidney function impairment.31
Moreover, other studies focused on the bidirectional relationship between CKD and AF, and the diseases were suspected to concurrently
increase the risk of one another.5-9 However, assessment of direct
causality between CKD and AF was difficult, as undiagnosed AF or
CKD is possible,32,33 the disorders share many risk factors raising the
concerns of confounding, and the issue of reverse causality cannot be
disregarded in observational studies.
In this study, we assessed the bidirectional causal effect between
CKD and AF by implementing MR analysis. As MR tests the effect of
genetic predisposition to exposure, which precedes any confounders
or outcome occurrence, it can demonstrate causal effects but
requires that three assumptions are met.10 First, the relevance assumption, meaning that the genetic instrument should be strongly
associated with the exposure of interest, was fulfilled by the previous
GWAS meta-analysis, which robustly provided the genetic variants
with strong association with the exposures. Second, the restrictionexclusion assumption means that the effect should be through the
exposure of interest. Although a direct test for this assumption is impossible, the weighted median method relaxes this assumption for a

Effect sizes of a standard deviation increase in the allele scores are shown. The causal estimates were adjusted for age, sex, genotype measurement batch, and the first 10 principal components of the genetic information in the UK Biobank data.
a
The genetic instrument included SNPs showed genome-wide significant association with log-eGFR in the CKDGen data, also with strong/relevant association with eGFR (cystatin C) level in the UK Biobank data, and not associated with potential confounders.
b
The genetic instrument included SNPs showed genome-wide significant association with log-eGFR in the CKDGen data, also with strong/relevant association with blood urea
nitrogen in the CKDGen data, not associated with potential confounders, and passing additional filtering (e.g. Steiger filtering for blood pressure traits).

concerns of such issue, including fewer but stronger SNPs, and replicated results in different outcome data may decrease the possibility
of false-positive findings, yet the potential bias should be carefully
inspected in MR investigations with summary statistics from largescale genetic consortia. Second, although the causal effects from AF
to CKD were demonstrated, whether the risk of kidney function impairment can actually be reduced through management of AF should
be assessed in a future trial. Third, as genetic analysis is weak for
detecting nonlinear effects and provides qualitative rather than quantitative information,42 the clinical effects may be different from the effect sizes of our genetic analysis. Particularly, the magnitude of the
effects from paroxysmal AF and from persistent AF on kidney function may have certain differences. Fourth, the remaining possibility of
the effects from shared risk factors for AF and CKD may be present,
as causal estimates with a binary exposure, AF in our study, may represent the average causal effects from disease liability.43 Lastly, the
study population included mainly individuals of European ancestry,
and in the multiethnic analysis, consideration of the difference in ethnic diversity was limited due to data availability. A further study limiting the analysis to other ethnic populations may be helpful in
confirming the generalizability of the results.
In conclusion, this study supports that AF is a causal risk factor for
kidney function impairment. Clinicians may pay attention to AF in
CKD patients and monitor kidney function in those with AF. A further study may consider whether appropriate management of AF
may lead to a decreased risk of kidney function impairment.

portion of the instruments, serving as a sensitivity analysis. In addition,
our investigation in those without phenotypical AF supported that a
horizontal pleiotropic pathway may not be present. Third, the independence assumption means that the genetic variant in the instrument should not affect the outcome through a confounder. We
performed multiple pleiotropy-robust MR methods and disregarded
variants that might have horizontal pleiotropic effects on our
results.21-23 Thus, by performing extensive MR analysis, our study
suggested that AF causally increases the risk of kidney function impairment; on the other hand, the causal effects from kidney function
on AF were nonsignificant.
The clinical application of our study is suggested below. First, as AF
is a causal risk factor for CKD, appropriate management of AF may
lead to reduced risks of kidney function impairment. Thus, a future
clinical trial may assess kidney function outcomes when performing
interventions for AF, which previous studies reported related evidences.34,35 Second, as AF is a causal factor for CKD, clinicians may perform early screening for AF in CKD patients.32 In particular, those
with common risk factors for AF or elderly patients may be the target
group that warrants such a strategy, and such early diagnosis may
lead to a reduced risk of progression of kidney function impairment.
Third, clinicians may monitor kidney function in AF patients because
they bear a burden of increased risk of CKD due to the presence
of AF.
Explanation of the mechanism of the identified causal effects can
be suggested by the current literature. Decreased cardiac output by
AF causes systemic congestion,36,37 which would cause an increase in
kidney venous pressure, further leading to a reduction in kidney perfusion pressure, which is the difference between kidney arterial and
venous pressure. As kidney perfusion pressure is a major determinant of glomerular filtration rate, such impaired glomerular perfusion
due to AF would cause kidney function impairment.38 In addition,
chronic neurohormonal activation caused by AF, including upregulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system,39 may also adversely affect kidney function if it persists. In addition,
thromboembolism may be caused by AF, leading to kidney infarcts;
however, this may not be a general etiology for the causal effects
identified through this MR investigation, considering the relatively
low prevalence of kidney infarction.40
That kidney function did not show significant causal effects on AF
should be interpreted with caution. Our study suggests that effects
from AF to CKD may be prioritized over effects in the reverse direction in the general population. However, as the genetic instrument
explains a portion of a phenotype, the possibility remains that kidney
function may have a modest degree of effect on AF. In addition, as we
tested the effects mostly from mild-to-moderate CKD, the cardiovascular effects from severe kidney failure or acute kidney injury may be
different from the current findings. Moreover, as CKD and AF share
risk factors, certain CKD events would still precede AF.30 However,
considering that kidney function also did not show significant causal
effects on heart failure in a previous study implementing MR,41 the
direct effect of kidney function on AF or heart failure would be
smaller than those of other important causal factors for AF.
There are several limitations in this study. First, there was overlap
in samples in genetic instrument development and outcome assessment in certain MR investigations, which may cause bias towards observational findings.25 That we performed sensitivity analysis in
