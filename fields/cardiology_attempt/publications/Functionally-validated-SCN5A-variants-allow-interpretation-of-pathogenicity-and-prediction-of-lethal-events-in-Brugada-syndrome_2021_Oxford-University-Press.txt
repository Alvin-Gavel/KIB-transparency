Aims

The prognostic value of genetic variants for predicting lethal arrhythmic events (LAEs) in Brugada syndrome (BrS) remains
controversial. We investigated whether the functional curation of SCN5A variations improves prognostic predictability.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
Using a heterologous expression system and whole-cell patch clamping, we functionally characterized 22 variants of unand results
known significance (VUSs) among 55 SCN5A mutations previously curated using in silico prediction algorithms in the

Japanese BrS registry (n = 415). According to the loss-of-function (LOF) properties, SCN5A mutation carriers (n = 60)
were divided into two groups: LOF-SCN5A mutations and non-LOF SCN5A variations. Functionally proven LOF-SCN5A
mutation carriers (n = 45) showed significantly severer electrocardiographic conduction abnormalities and worse prognosis associated with earlier manifestations of LAEs (7.9%/year) than in silico algorithm-predicted SCN5A carriers (5.1%/
year) or all BrS probands (2.5%/year). Notably, non-LOF SCN5A variation carriers (n = 15) exhibited no LAEs during
the follow-up period. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that only LOF-SCN5A mutations and a history of aborted cardiac arrest were significant predictors of LAEs. Gene-based association studies using whole-exome sequencing data on

another independent SCN5A mutation-negative BrS cohort (n = 288) showed no significant enrichment of rare variants
in 16 985 genes including 22 non-SCN5A BrS-associated genes as compared with controls (n = 372). Furthermore, rare
variations of non-SCN5A BrS-associated genes did not affect LAE-free survival curves.

In vitro functional validation is key to classifying the pathogenicity of SCN5A VUSs and for risk stratification of genetic predictors of LAEs. Functionally proven LOF-SCN5A mutations are genetic burdens of sudden death in BrS, but

Translational Perspective
SCN5A mutations are associated with the risk of lethal arrhythmia in Brugada syndrome (BrS); however, nearly 70% of BrS-associated
SCN5A rare variations registered in ClinVar are classified as variants of unknown significance, requiring curation strategies to accurately
differentiate pathogenic from benign variations to predict patient prognosis. As a monogenic trait, functionally validated loss-of-function
SCN5A mutations, but not rare coding variants of other BrS-associated genes, are genetic risks of lethal arrhythmias in BrS. Although
the contribution of polygenetic factors in BrS warrants further investigation, these results may help to develop a new personalized risk
stratification paradigm for sudden cardiac death.

Among currently recognized genetic and non-genetic risk factors for Brugada syndrome, functionally validated loss-of-function SCN5A mutations are associated with worse prognosis with earlier manifestation of lethal arrhythmic events (7.9%/year) than in silico algorithm-predicted SCN5A rare variations
(5.1%/year) or Brugada-type ECG (2.5%/year).

pathological rare variants and assessed if non-SCN5A rare coding variants contribute to the genetic burden of sudden death in BrS.

Methods
Patients and study cohorts
The diagnosis of BrS was made according to the criteria of a consensus
report,16 and LAE was defined as sudden cardiac death, cardiac arrest,
ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation, or appropriate discharge of
implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). Clinical characteristics
including time to first LAE and electrocardiographic (ECG) parameters
were obtained as previously described.5 This study was approved by the
institutional review board (National Cerebral and Cardiovascular Center,
R19048) and local ethics committee of each institution. All participants in
the cohorts provided written informed consent before clinical and genetic investigations in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
This study consisted of two independent Japanese multicentre BrS
cohorts, specifically BrS cohort-I (415 probands)5 and BrS cohort-II (288
unrelated probands), and 372 ethnic-matched controls (Figure 1 and
Table 1). In BrS cohort-I, BrS probands were assigned as SCN5A mutation
carriers (SCN5A(th); n = 60) and SCN5A mutation negative probands
(SCN5A(-); n = 355) based on Sanger sequencing as previously described.5
We enrolled independent Japanese BrS probands (cohort-II), whose
negative SCN5A genotype statuses were determined in advance by
Sanger sequencing. BrS cohort-II and the control Japanese subjects were
subjected to whole-exome sequencing and gene-wise association test. In
silico prediction of SCN5A variants was performed using seven algorithms
as previously described.5,8 Further information is provided in the
Supplementary material online, Methods.

Assignment and functional evaluation of 22
variants of unknown significance
We performed public database screening and PubMed literature search
for 55 variations reported in BrS cohort-I and identified 22 VUSs. To
functionally evaluate the Na channel properties of 22 VUSs, we constructed human SCN5A expression plasmids of VUSs using site-directed
mutagenesis, and INa of HEK293T cells were recorded using the wholecell patch-clamp technique using a heterologous expression system.
After analysing the biophysical properties of 22 VUS channels, the 55 variants were categorized into two groups, LOF and non-LOF, according to
the presence or absence of significantly reduced peak INa density than
wild-type (WT) SCN5A, respectively. Detailed information is provided in
the Supplementary material online, Methods.

Statistical analyses
Quantitative variables are shown as mean +/- standard deviation unless
otherwise stated. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05. For the statistical analysis of continuous variables with a normal distribution, one-way
analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni's post hoc comparison tests
was used. The cumulative probability of an index LAE over the course of
the patient follow-up or their entire lifetime was determined using
Kaplan-Meier methods for each subgroup, and the difference in survival
rates was analysed using a log-rank test. Univariate analysis using a Cox
proportional-hazards model was performed to determine variables that
improve the prediction of LAEs. Independent variables with P < 0.05 in
the univariate analyses were included in the multivariate analysis.
Statistical analyses were performed using the R programme (version
4.0.2) and SPSS statistical package (version 26).

whereas our Japanese multicentre BrS cohort study has previously
demonstrated that 60 probands carrying 55 different SCN5A mutations exhibited their first LAE at younger ages (34 vs. 42 years) than
probands without SCN5A mutations (n = 355).5 Observations consistent with those of the latter study were reported in an Italian BrS
cohort.6 The selection bias of patients5 or demonstrated transethnic
differences in the phenotypic severity of BrS, and the frequency
of SCN5A variations7 may underlie the discrepancy of the aforementioned studies. Nevertheless, and more importantly, SCN5A mutations often exhibit incomplete penetrance in BrS, and this gene is
associated with a relatively high background rate of rare missense
variants in the general population (2-5%). Moreover, efforts to enhance the classification of SCN5A missense variants using protein topology-driven estimated predictive assessments or in silico prediction
algorithms are limited compared with those for other major cardiac
channelopathy genes, such as KCNQ1/KCNH2.8 Therefore, risk assessment of SCN5A variants using phenotypic data of a single variant
carrier remains challenging, and an inaccurate classification of rare
variants might have obscured the prognostic value of SCN5A.
The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the
Association for Molecular Pathology (ACMG-AMP) guidelines provide approaches for a more appropriate classification of pathogenic
variants, and 'functional studies supporting a deleterious effect (PS3)'
are assigned one of four criteria with 'strong evidence' of pathogenicity.9 Loss of function (LOF) of cardiac Na current (INa) due to
SCN5A mutations is the primary pathophysiology underpinning BrS.
A previous functional study has shown that patients carrying null
SCN5A mutations experience more frequent episodes of syncope
and more severe conduction abnormalities than those with other
types of SCN5A mutations.10 More recently, Glazer et al. have shown
that patch clamping enables reclassification of variants of unknown
significance (VUSs) of SCN5A.11 These studies suggest that in vitro
functional re-evaluation of SCN5A variations may improve LAE predictability in BrS. In the present study, we conducted a PubMed
search and re-evaluated the function of 55 SCN5A rare variants previously curated via multiple in silico prediction algorithms in a Japanese
BrS cohort5 and determined whether the functionally proven SCN5A
mutations may improve the predictive value for LAE in patients with
BrS.
Increasing evidence suggests that BrS is unlikely to be a Mendelian
monogenic disease but rather an oligogenic disorder involving multiple rare and nonrare variants, as well as structural abnormalities and
inflammation, contributing to the underlying basis of the disease.12 A
previous international genome-wide association study identified
three common independent susceptibility variants close to SCN5A,
SCN10A, and HEY2,13 and to date, >20 genes have been reported to
be associated with BrS.14 Although no significant enrichment of these
rare coding variants, except for SCN5A, were observed in BrS cases15
and the ClinGen consortium recently reported SCN5A as the only
causative gene with definitive evidence for the diagnosis of BrS,14 the
predictive value of non-SCN5A coding variants for the long-term
prognosis of BrS-i.e. LAE and sudden cardiac death-has never
been evaluated. In this study, we performed whole-exome sequencing on a distinct SCN5A-negative BrS cohort to identify novel

Results
Functional classification of BrSassociated 55 SCN5A variations
A PubMed search identified 21 publications that described the biophysical properties of 22 SCN5A variations (17 missense, one inframe deletion, and four nonsense variations) (Figure 1 and
Supplementary material online, Table S1). Moreover, among 55 variations, 11 were novel null variants (two nonsense, six frame-shift,
three canonical splice site) classified as PVS1 (very strong evidence of
pathogenicity) according to the ACMG-AMP guidelines.9
Accordingly, the remaining 22 missense variations were assigned as
VUS (Table 1). The functional properties of each VUS were analysed
using whole-cell patch-clamp assays (Supplementary material online,
Figure S1) and categorized into two groups according to the degree
of peak INa reduction: LOF (significantly reduced INa density compared with WT; n = 13), and non-LOF (no significant difference compared with WT; n = 9), and the border zone of LOF and non-LOF
was 53.2-65.6% (Supplementary material online, Table S2). Since the
experimental conditions of current study and previous patch-clamp
studies were largely similar (Supplementary material online, Table
S3), both data were combined with null PVS1 mutations (n = 11) to
classify a total of 55 variants according to their biophysical properties
as follows: LOF (n = 40) and non-LOF (n = 15) (Figure 2 and
Supplementary material online, Table S4). The locations of the 55 variants, illustrated based on Nav1.5 protein topology, exhibited diffuse
distribution within the entire protein.

the LOF compared to the non-LOF or SCN5A(-) (Supplementary material online, Figure S2). However, no significant differences were
observed in these parameters between non-LOF and SCN5A(-), suggesting that conduction parameters reflect the severity of Na channel
dysfunction associated with SCN5A variations (Supplementary material online, Table S5). Alternatively, other electrophysiological and clinical findings were largely comparable among the three groups
(Supplementary material online, Figure S3).

probands developed LAEs during follow-up (Figure 3). Furthermore,
LOF exhibited significantly more frequent total lifetime events and
ICD implantation than non-LOF. Most LAEs (n = 56, 90%) were terminated by appropriate ICD discharges, and LAE-free rates by
Kaplan-Meier analysis were comparable regardless of ICD discharge.
These data suggest that an appropriate ICD discharge serves as a surrogate for sudden cardiac death in BrS (Supplementary material online, Figure S4); therefore, it was hypothesized that the prognosis of
BrS patients can be discriminated based on LOF properties of the
SCN5A variants.
Based on this assumption, we calculated the cumulative rate of an
index LAE during the mean follow-up period of 72 months (range, 1-
249 months) using the Kaplan-Meier method for several subgroups
with different statuses with respect to Na channel properties
(Figure 4). Patients carrying SCN5A rare variants (SCN5A(th); n = 60)
had a significantly higher annual LAE rate than SCN5A(-) (n = 355;
5.1%/year vs. 2.2%/year; P = 0.017, Figure 4A and Table 2), as previously reported.5 The estimated mean LAE-free periods (mean +/- standard error) for patients of SCN5A(th) and SCN5A(-) were 136.6 +/- 12.9
and 210.8 +/- 6.0 months, respectively. As shown in Figure 4B, none of
the non-LOF subgroup developed LAEs during the follow-up period,
whereas the LOF subgroup had a significantly higher LAE rate (7.9%/
year, P = 0.019; Figure 4B, Table 2, and Supplementary material online,
Table S6) and a shorter LAE-free period (94.5 +/- 10.7 months). By
combining non-LOF and SCN5A(-) results, we re-evaluated the survival curves of patients with or without LOF-SCN5A mutations
(Figure 4C) and found that the LOF subgroup exhibited a significantly
higher annual LAE rate and shorter estimated mean LAE-free period
than the non-LOF plus SCN5A(-) (2.1%/year, 208.8 +/- 5.9 months,
n = 370; P = 0.0001, Figure 4C and Table 2). Qualitatively similar results
were obtained from Kaplan-Meier analysis with shorter follow-up
period (<107 months) (Supplementary material online, Figure S5).

Reclassification of SCN5A variations and
the predictability of LAEs
Univariate analysis using a Cox proportional hazard model showed
that the positive status of both functionally validated LOF-SCN5A
mutations and in silico algorithm-predicted rare SCN5A variations are
significant predictors of LAEs, but the former exhibited a higher hazard ratio than the latter (Table 3 and Supplementary material online,
Table S6).5 Multivariate analyses were then performed using independent variables with P < 0.05 in univariate analysis (with two different SCN5A statuses) (Tables 3 and 4). A history of aborted cardiac
arrest was the strongest predictor of LAEs regardless of the SCN5A
status. Moreover, SCN5A variant status was a significant predictor of
LAE, and the predictive values of functionally validated LOF-SCN5A
mutations were higher than that of in silico-predicted rare SCN5A variations demonstrated previously.5 In contrast, prolonged QRS, or
documented atrial fibrillation, were not predictors of LAEs in BrS.

rare variants did not affect the age of initial LAE in BrS cohort-II
(Figure 5). Even when focusing on genes that are known to modulate
cardiac Na channel function, rare variants of these genes were not
enriched in cases nor affected the prognosis of BrS cohort-II
(Supplementary material online, Figure S7 and Supplementary material online, Table S8). Thus, we find no evidence supporting an association between the BrS-associated non-SCN5A genes and sudden
arrhythmic death.

In this study, we aimed to dissect the genetic basis of BrS by conducting electrophysiological evaluations of SCN5A variations and demonstrated that functionally validated LOF-SCN5A mutations, not rare

coding variations of other BrS-related genes, are associated with genetic risks of lethal arrhythmia in BrS. In addition to a history of
aborted cardiac arrest being the strongest and most well-established
predictor of future LAEs in patients with BrS, we demonstrated, to
the best of our knowledge, for the first time that LOF-SCN5A mutations are an independent and significant predictor of sudden death.
Advances in genetic sequencing have increased the potential yield
of genetic testing, while raising the clinical dilemma of the discovery
of many VUSs compromising the accuracy of variant interpretation.
The pathogenicity of SCN5A variants in BrS has often been unknown
or disputed; 67.5% of the total 1140 BrS-associated SCN5A variations
submitted to ClinVar are classified as either of uncertain significance,
no assertion provided, or conflicting interpretations.17 These VUSs
are often specific to a particular family, and their penetrance and expressivity are highly variable in BrS,1 hampering the annotation of
their pathogenicity through segregation analysis. In the ACMG-AMP
guidelines, the evidence level of pathogenicity for 'absent in population databases' is assigned as moderate (PM2), while that of 'in silico
prediction algorithms' is assigned as supporting (PP3). Specificity of in
silico algorithms to predict the pathogenicity of missense variants is
generally low despite their high sensitivity,9 resulting in the overprediction of missense variations as deleterious. Recent studies, using
purely in silico analyses, including systematic evaluation using the
ACMG-AMP guidelines, failed to predict the disease risk of SCN5A
variants in BrS.18,19 These results support the observation of our
study that 27% of the SCN5A missense VUSs (15/55) were overpredicted in silico, therefore implicating the need for additional reliable
tools to improve the annotation of pathogenicity for large numbers
of SCN5A VUSs. In this study, we propose that the functional evaluation of SCN5A VUSs using a patch-clamp study might be an efficient
strategy to aid the differentiation of malignant variants associated
with predisposition to sudden death from those that are innocuous
(Graphical Abstract).
Among the 55 functionally reclassified SCN5A variants, including 22
VUSs, most (40 variants, 73%, LOF) showed a significant reduction in
peak INa compared to WT-SCN5A, which was associated with more
severe abnormalities in ECG conduction parameters (Supplementary
material online, Figure S2), and an earlier manifestation of LAEs
(Figure 4). Note that our in vitro functional classification of SCN5A
variants according to the significant INa density reduction (LOF vs.
non-LOF) successfully dissected the cumulative risk of LAEs in the 60
carriers during the follow-up period (Figure 4B). The close relationship between the degree of SCN5A Na channel dysfunction and the
phenotypic severity has been previously reported; SCN5A truncation
mutation carriers were found to have more syncopal episodes and
prolonged cardiac conduction abnormalities than missense mutation
carriers.10 Another Italian study of 92 BrS patients identified four
SCN5A mutations (R104Q, L276Q, E1225K, and A1428S) in 12
patients with LAE during follow-up,6 and our dataset included BrS
probands carrying the identical LOF mutations (Supplementary material online, Table S4). These observations further support the notion that LOF-SCN5A mutations are phenotypically malignant and
associated with LAE, while the reduction in peak INa density serves as
the principal predictor of BrS disease risk. Further functional evaluations and larger scale clinical studies involving more SCN5A-positive
cases are warranted to prove this hypothesis.

Although >20 non-SCN5A-associated genes have been recognized
in BrS, precise interpretation of the pathogenicity of rare variations of
these genes is often challenging. Using rare variant burden analysis of
BrS-associated genes, Le Scouarnec et al.15 identified a significant enrichment of SCN5A coding variants only in BrS cases and not in controls, but not those of other BrS-associated genes. Using an
evidence-based ClinGen approach, Hosseini et al.14 concluded that
SCN5A is the only gene classified with definitive evidence of disease
causality in BrS. Herein, we used whole-exome sequencing in a larger

cohort of BrS patients lacking SCN5A mutations and demonstrated
that the rare coding variations of non-SCN5A BrS-associated genes
were neither enriched in BrS (Supplementary material online, Figure
S6), nor modified the long-term prognosis of BrS patients (Figure 5).
Our data further support the notion that LOF-SCN5A mutations, but
not rare coding variants of other BrS-susceptible genes, are the genetic burden of LAE in BrS.
The absence of LOF-SCN5A mutations in a given patient with BrS
does not necessarily suggest a benign prognosis since disease

presentation is affected by several factors, including age, sex, common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near the SCN5A/
SCN10A/HEY2 genes,13 and structural abnormalities including fibrosis
and inflammation.12 Considering that most (80%) patients with BrS
are mutation negative, it is speculated that the genetic risk of sudden
death is also determined by both monogenic factors (rare LOFSCN5A mutations) and polygenic factors (unidentified common variants) (Graphical Abstract). Although SNPs associated with sudden
death or lethal arrhythmia have not been elucidated in BrS, it is possible that the polygenetic contribution of BrS-associated common
SNPs in SCN5A-negative BrS may be equivalent to or even greater
than in SCN5A-positive BrS.20

Study limitations
Patients in this study were exclusively of Japanese descent and limited
in number; therefore, our study should be replicated using larger
cohorts of different ethnicities. Electrophysiological properties of the
variants were analysed based on heterologous expression; however,

some SCN5A variants might exhibit different properties in HEK293T
cells as compared with those in cardiomyocytes or in vivo.21

Conclusions
In vitro functional validation is a key method for classifying the pathogenicity of SCN5A VUSs. Functionally-validated LOF-SCN5A mutations contribute to the genetic burden of sudden death in BrS.
Integrating the genetic information of LOF-SCN5A mutations with
other rare or polygenic common risk variations, which are currently
unknown, may help to develop a new personalized risk stratification
paradigm for the complex oligogenic disease, BrS.
