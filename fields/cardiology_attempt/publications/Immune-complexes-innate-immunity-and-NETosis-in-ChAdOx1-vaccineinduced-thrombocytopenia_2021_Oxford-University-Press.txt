Aims

We recently reported five cases of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) 7-10 days after
receiving the first dose of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 adenoviral vector vaccine against corona virus disease 2019
(COVID-19). We aimed to investigate the pathogenic immunological responses operating in these patients.

Methods and
We assessed circulating inflammatory markers by immune assays and immune cell phenotyping by flow cytometry
analyses and performed immunoprecipitation with anti-platelet factor (PF)4 antibody in plasma samples followed by
results

mass spectrometry from all five patients. A thrombus was retrieved from the sinus sagittal superior of one patient
and analysed by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. Precipitated immune complexes revealed multiple innate immune pathway triggers for platelet and leucocyte activation. Plasma contained increased levels of innate immune response cytokines and markers of systemic inflammation, extensive degranulation of neutrophils, and tissue
and endothelial damage. Blood analyses showed activation of neutrophils and increased levels of circulating H3Cit,
dsDNA, and myeloperoxidase-DNA complex. The thrombus had extensive infiltration of neutrophils, formation of
neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), and IgG deposits.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusions
The results show that anti-PF4/polyanion IgG-mediated thrombus formation in VITT patients is accompanied by a

massive innate immune activation and particularly the fulminant activation of neutrophils including NETosis. These
results provide novel data on the immune response in this rare adenoviral vector-induced VITT.

Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia

Introduction
On March 11, after 132 686 individuals in Norway had received the
first dose of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 adenoviral vector vaccine
against COVID-19,1 this vaccination was stopped following reports
from Denmark of a possible connection between the vaccine and
fatal cases of thrombosis.2 Within 10 days after vaccination with
ChAdOx1 nCov-19, five healthcare workers from 32 to 54 years of
age were admitted to Oslo University Hospital with severe cases of
thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, remarkably high titres of antiplatelet factor (PF)4/polyanion IgG, and atypical, hyperactive platelet
aggregation assays. Three of the five patients died, of what has been
termed as vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia
(VITT) in two previous reports.3,4 More recently, Scully et al.5
reported 23 similar cases with severe thrombotic episodes 6-24 days
following ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination. Based on reported cases
of VITT from nine countries with moderate-to-high data quality, the
estimated risk of developing VITT after the first dose of ChAdOx1
nCoV-19 ranges from 1 case per 26 500 to 1 case per 148 200.6 All

described.3 Blood samples from health careworkers of both sexes, in the
same age group as the patients, were used as controls for plasma studies
(unvaccinated n = 11, ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccinated n = 8). Controls for
flow cytometry analysis of blood cells included samples from nonvaccinated blood bank donors (n = 11) and vaccinated healthcare workers (n = 8).

Ethical considerations

Results
Analysis of immune complexes
The spontaneous aggregation of platelets by anti-PF4/polyanion IgG
patient samples3 demonstrated that circulating IC could activate platelets directly in the absence of added heparin. We precipitated IC
with anti-PF4 antibodies and analysed for protein content. Analysis
revealed the expected antibodies and PF4, and principal component
analysis of the mass spectrometry data showed that the patient group
clearly separated from the healthy vaccinated or non-vaccinated controls (Figure 1A). In addition, the IC contained multiple innate immune
pathway activators (Figure 1B) that included complement pathway
(classical pathways: C1s, C2, lectin pathway; MBL: MASP2), the acute
phase C-reactive protein (CRP) that also can activate the classical
complement pathway, nucleosomes/chromatin [histones and toll-like
receptor (TLR)9 cofactor cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide
(CAMP)], lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), a co-activator of
CD14, and the platelet activator von Willebrand factor (VWF) that is
released upon endothelial cell activation. The IC thus included ligands
for innate immune response pathways including FccR, PF4 receptors,
complement receptors, CD14, and platelet thrombosis-glycoprotein Ib (GPIb). Proteoglycan 4 contains glycosaminoglycan (GAG)
chondroitin sulphate and keratan sulphate polyanions and may potentially serve as a PF4 ligand. Leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein is
expressed mainly in granula of neutrophils. Kinesin-like protein
(KIF25) is a cytosolic microtubule-dependent motor protein that
would require release via necrosis or potentially also neutrophil
extracellular trap (NET)osis.
We also found serine-protease inhibitors (serpin family A members) 10, 3, and 1 that may have anti-coagulative effects (see
Discussion). The acute phase proteins, serum amyloid A-1 and A-2
proteins (SAA1, SAA2), bleomycin hydrolase, cysteine proteinase
inhibitors (CST1 or 4), inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H3 (a
hyaluronan binder), cholesteryl ester transfer protein, and the apolipoprotein, apolipoprotein A-V (APOA5), have unclear consequence
and/or function in terms of the IC. No peptides from the viral vector
(chimpanzee adenovirus serotype Y25) and no SARS-CoV-2 spike
peptide sequences were detected.

Activation of blood leucocytes
Flow cytometry analysis of whole blood from the patients demonstrated an increased frequency of activated (HLA-DRth and CD38th)
and immature neutrophil subpopulations that had decreased expression of CD15, CD16, CD66b, CD101, and CD107,8 (Figure 3A and
Supplementary material online, Figure S2). This expansion of immature neutrophil was not observed in healthy vaccinated donors. In
two of the patients, intravenous immunoglobulin treatment was associated with normalized cell count, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, and
neutrophil phenotype, as illustrated by the follow-up time points
showing a similar profile as the healthy controls (Figure 3B and
Supplementary material online, Figure S3). In contrast, the flow analyses did not reveal activation of T cells or isotype class switching for B
cells in VITT patients compared to controls.

Multi-parameter analysis was performed to find significant correlations. Pearson's correlation analysis showed that the alarmins
(S100A8/A9) significantly correlated with markers of platelet degranulation (PF4, platelet-derived growth factor-DD), endothelial
damage (P-selectin) and NETosis (dsDNA and H3Cit; Figure 2B). We
combined these parameters in a Volcano plot, which establish a hierarchy among our markers and highlighted the importance of the alarmins S100A8/A9, P-selectin, MPO (neutrophil marker), and PTX3
(potentiation of complement) for VITT (Supplementary material online, Figure S1). The same markers together with GDF-15 (associated
with tissue damage) correlated significantly with fatal outcome among
the hospitalized individuals (Supplementary material online, Figure
S1).

to a proinflammatory immune profile in all patients analysed, including cytokines that trigger innate immunity with massive activation of
neutrophils in the circulation. We also found extensive neutrophil activation and NET formation in venous sinus sagittal superior thrombi
from one of the patients with fatal outcome.
The present study highlights the role of innate immune responses
in VITT that includes an unusual fulminant focal neutrophil activation
in cell-rich thrombi as well as systemic activation of leucocytes and
circulating cytokines, free nucleic acids, and acute phase reactants.
Increased levels of alarmins S100A8 and S100A9 were observed
both in circulation and in the sinus thrombus. These constitute 45%
of cytosolar proteins in neutrophils9 and after secretion are potent
triggers of innate inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 that we found
to be increased in the plasma of VITT patients.
An important finding in this study was the massive NET formation at
the site of thrombus formation in the one patient who died. All five
patients also have indirect signs of NET formation in peripheral blood
(H3Cit, dsDNA, MPO-DNA complex) as opposed to healthy controls and vaccinated healthcare workers without signs of thrombus
formation. Neutrophil extracellular traps in interaction with platelets
are involved in thrombus formation during severe COVID-19 disease
and have also been seen during atherothrombus formation10,11 and
have been detailed in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia patients.12,13
However, the massive immune infiltration including high numbers of
neutrophils and related inflammatory molecules, as observed in these
patients, is unusual.
Mass spectrometry analysis of immunoprecipitated PF4 from
plasma identified PF4 in complex with proteins such as histones, complement pathway factors, GAG-binding lectins, and antibodies, suggesting several inflammatory pathways involved. These are ligands for
a number of pathways that can explain the observations of marked inflammatory responses in these patients.
Although the mechanisms are not yet clear, adenovirus can activate platelets in a VWF and P-selectin14 and alternative complement
pathway dependent manner.15,16 It is thus plausible that the adenoviral vector itself activated platelets and provided a first trigger for
PF4 secretion. PF4/polyanion is a chemokine and can in itself activate
leucocytes via the CXCR3-B splice variant of CXCR3 and CCR1.17-
19
Platelets express CCR1 that can trigger aggregation,20 but the effect of PF4/GAG on platelet CCR1 is unclear. PF4 is secreted from agranules of platelets as a tetrameric complex bound to serglycin
GAG chains.21 The GAG serve as polyanion ligands for cationic
amine acid side chains of PF4. The complex includes four PF4 and
two GAGs, these may be chondroitin sulphate or dermatan sulphate.
After secretion, PF4 may bind other ligands with higher affinity, such
as endothelial-derived perlecan heparan sulphate side chains,22 or
other polyanions.
It is thought that the polyanions allow conformational changes in
PF4 exposing antigenic determinants for anti-PF4 IgG antibodies.23
Our patients all had high titres of anti-PF4/polyanion IgG and platelet
aggregation could not be abolished by high dose heparin in the majority of patients.3 This indicated an unidentified non-heparin polyanion
in the patients. The anti-PF4 IgG constitutes a second trigger as platelets express FccRIIA (CD32a). FccRIIA is a low-affinity Fc receptor
for the constant region of IgG that recognizes ICs with high avidity
and causes platelet aggregation and dense granule exposed release,24
exposure of phosphatidylserine, complement factor deposition, and

Recently, Norway and Denmark stopped the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination after several reported cases of vaccine-induced syndrome
of severe thrombosis and thrombocytopenia with fatal outcome. Samples from vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia
(VITT) patients allowed us to investigate mechanisms in this severe syndrome and we report immune complexes (ICs) with multi-pathway triggers, innate immune response cytokines, activation of neutrophils in the blood, and extensive formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) surrounded by IgG in a thrombus ectomized from the sagittal sinus vein. Our results shed light on the underlying
mechanisms in this rare adenoviral vector vaccine-induced syndrome of severe thrombosis and thrombocytopenia and suggest that antibody-mediated thrombus formation in VITT patients is accompanied by a massive innate immune activation with particular activation of
neutrophils, at least partly induced by IC-mediated mechanisms with NET formation as a major pathogenic event.
