Aims

Cardiac injury and remodelling are associated with the rearrangement of cardiac lipids. Glycosphingolipids are membrane
lipids that are important for cellular structure and function, and cardiac dysfunction is a characteristic of rare monogenic
diseases with defects in glycosphingolipid synthesis and turnover. However, it is not known how cardiac glycosphingolipids regulate cellular processes in the heart. The aim of this study is to determine the role of cardiac glycosphingolipids
in heart function.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
Using human myocardial biopsies, we showed that the glycosphingolipids glucosylceramide and lactosylceramide are
and results
present at very low levels in non-ischaemic human heart with normal function and are elevated during remodelling.

Similar results were observed in mouse models of cardiac remodelling. We also generated mice with cardiomyocytespecific deficiency in Ugcg, the gene encoding glucosylceramide synthase (hUgcg-/- mice). In 9- to 10-week-old hUgcg-/-
mice, contractile capacity in response to dobutamine stress was reduced. Older hUgcg-/- mice developed severe heart
failure and left ventricular dilatation even under baseline conditions and died prematurely. Using RNA-seq and cell culture models, we showed defective endolysosomal retrograde trafficking and autophagy in Ugcg-deficient cardiomyocytes. We also showed that responsiveness to b-adrenergic stimulation was reduced in cardiomyocytes from hUgcg-/-
mice and that Ugcg knockdown suppressed the internalization and trafficking of b1-adrenergic receptors.

Introduction
Progression of heart failure, a leading cause of death worldwide
whose prevalence is increasing,1 is associated with maladaptive ventricular remodelling in response to myocardial infarction or
other cardiac injury.2,3 This remodelling is characterized by an immediate enlargement of existing cardiomyocytes and increased left ventricular mass to compensate for the loss of contractile activity in the
affected zone. Although remodelling likely confers short-term benefits, the left ventricle will expand and dilate over time, resulting in wall
stress, ineffective contractile performance, and ultimately heart
failure.2,4

Cardiac injury and remodelling are associated with changes in cardiac lipid composition.5-8 Myocardial ischaemia has long been linked
to cardiac triglycerides,5 and we and others have shown that cardiac
sphingolipids accumulate in the ischaemic heart.7,9,10 Sphingolipids
have also been implicated in cardiac disease. For example, several
genome-wide association studies have linked genetic variants in
sphingolipid (and especially glycosphingolipid) synthesis genes to the
incidence of myocardial infarction.11 In addition, cardiac dysfunction
is a characteristic of rare monogenic diseases with defects in
glycosphingolipid biosynthesis and turnover, such as Gaucher type III
and Fabry (resulting in accumulation of glycosphingolipids in lysosomes).12,13 However, studies of cardiac sphingolipids have mainly

Translational perspective
The molecular mechanisms that drive the progression of heart failure are poorly understood due to the complex and multifactorial
nature of the disease. Emerging evidence indicates that cardiac injury and remodelling are associated with the rearrangement of cardiac
lipid composition. In this study, we investigated the role of glycosphingolipids in heart function and found that cardiac glycosphingolipids
are required to maintain b-adrenergic signalling and contractile capacity in cardiomyocytes and to preserve normal heart function.
Thus, modulation of cardiac glycosphingolipids may represent a new promising inotropic therapeutic approach.

Methods
A detailed description of all methods is provided in the Supplementary
material online.

Human subjects
Cardiac biopsies were obtained from 44 cardiac surgery patients. All
patients were examined preoperatively with echocardiography and the
ejection fraction (EF) was measured. Non-ischaemic biopsies from the
left ventricle were obtained from seven subjects undergoing aortic valve
replacement, with angiography-verified absence of coronary artery disease in any major myocardial coronary artery branch, patient characteristics can be found in Supplementary material online, Table S1. Ischaemic
biopsies were obtained from 37 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery due to significant atherosclerotic stenosis in the epicardial
coronary arteries. Coronary angiograms of these patients revealed multivessel disease including significant stenosis of left main and/or left anterior
descending artery, patient characteristics can be found in Supplementary
material online, Table S2. The patients were scored for severity of coronary artery disease, from 1 to 5 with increasing severity (1 = single-vessel
disease, SVD; 2 = multivessel disease, MVD; 3 = left main, LM; 4 = LM th
SVD; 5 = LM th MVD). The patients were divided into two groups
according to their heart function; EF >55% (n = 22), which reflects a

.. normal heart function and EF <45% (n = 15), which reflects a reduced
..
.. heart function. The echocardiograms were analysed by an experienced
.. senior consultant in cardiology with expertise in echocardiography and
..
.. revealed that only four patients out of 20 with available echocardiography
.. (20%) showed cardiac remodelling in the patient group with normal EF;
..
.. while 9 out of 10 (90%) with available echocardiography showed remod.. elling in the patient group with low EF. Cardiac remodelling was defined
..
.. as the presence of hypertrophy and/or left ventricular dilatation. In add.. ition, area of hypokinesia/dyskinesia was identified, and myocardial biop..
.. sies were divided into remote, penumbra, or ischaemic (related to the

focused on the accumulation of lipotoxic ceramides after myocardial
ischaemia and the effects of blocking sphingolipid synthesis to reduce
ceramide accumulation.14-16 It is not known whether downstream
sphingolipids with a more structural function have a role in cardiomyocyte function.
Glycosphingolipids are membrane lipids that are important for cellular structure and function.17,18 They are abundant in caveolae and
lipid rafts,19 which are central for receptor signalling and vesicular
trafficking. Glycosphingolipids are synthesized in the Golgi apparatus.
The first step, glucosylation of ceramide to form glucosylceramide
(GlcCer), is catalysed by GlcCer synthase (encoded by UGCG).20
GlcCer is the precursor of lactosylceramide (LacCer) and more
complex glycosphingolipids.18 The glucosylation of sphingolipids to
generate glycosphingolipids alters the biophysical properties of cellular membranes21. Although glycosphingolipids play important roles in
many cellular signalling pathways,22,23 it is not known whether glycosphingolipids regulate cellular processes in the heart.
In this study, we investigated the role of cardiac glycosphingolipids
in heart function. We used human left ventricular biopsies to determine the association between glycosphingolipids and heart function.
Furthermore, we generated mice with cardiomyocyte-specific deficiency in glycosphingolipid synthesis (hUgcg-/- mice) and cell culture
models to ascertain how reduced levels of cardiac glycosphingolipids
affect cardiac physiology and function.

Statistical analysis

Results
Glycosphingolipid levels increase in the
remodelling heart
Ugcg, the gene encoding GlcCer synthase (which catalyses the first
step of glycosphingolipid synthesis, see Figure 1A for schematic overview), is expressed in most tissues; its expression is highest in bone
marrow, dendritic cells, and adrenal gland and much lower in cardiac
tissues in humans (Consensus dataset,25 www.proteinatlas.org (28
June 2021)). By profiling membrane lipids in human non-ischaemic
left ventricular tissues, we showed that the glycosphingolipids
GlcCer and LacCer were indeed present in human cardiac tissue, but
at lower levels than other membrane lipids (Table 1). GlcCer, but not
LacCer, concentrations were higher in left ventricular biopsies from
patients with reduced EF than in those with normal heart function
after chronic ischaemia (Figure 1B and C). However, glycosphingolipid
levels did not correlate with the severity of coronary artery disease
(Supplementary material online, Figure S1) or with the affected myocardial territory (Supplementary material online, Figure S2).
To confirm that glycosphingolipids are increased in the remodelling heart, we induced cardiac remodelling in mice by inducing a myocardial infarction or by injecting the non-selective b-adrenoceptor

.. (bAR) agonist isoproterenol. After the myocardial infarction, cardiac
..
.. GlcCer and LacCer levels were increased at both 24 and 72 h (Figure
.. 2A and B); GlcCer levels were higher both near the scar region (left
..
.. ventricle) and in remote regions (ventricular septum and atrium)
..
.. (Figure 2A) but LacCer levels were increased only near the scar region
.. (Figure 2B). At 24 h after isoproterenol injection, GlcCer levels were
..
.. increased in the atrium, but not in the left ventricle, and LacCer levels
.. were not altered (Figure 2C and D). Full lipidomics and metabolomics

and Timp1 and Ctgf, which encode the extracellular matrix regulators
tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 and connective tissue growth
factor (Figure 3B); and (ii) lower cardiac expression of known contractility markers (Figure 3C). Immunohistochemistry revealed emerging fibrosis in sections from hUgcg-/- mice (Supplementary material
online, Figure S6). Humoural factors, such as plasma noradrenaline
and BNP, were not significantly increased (Figure 3D). Furthermore,
when 9- to 10-week-old mice were injected with the b1AR agonist
dobutamine to induce physiological cardiac stress, diastolic and systolic volumes were higher, relative wall thickness was lower and velocity of circumferential fibre shortening was lower in hUgcg-/- mice
than in hUgcgth/th mice (Figure 3E, Supplementary material online,
Figure S7), indicating that the contractile capacity of young hUgcg-/-
mice is compromised during stress.
At 6 months of age, hUgcg-/- mice had pronounced characteristics of cardiomyopathy even under baseline conditions, with
enlarged hearts and LV dilatation (Figure 4A), profound fibrosis,
cardiomyocyte disarray, and glycogen accumulation (Figure 4B).
Heart weight and ventricular dimension were increased (Figure 4C
and D) and EF was severely reduced. Lung weight was also
increased (Figure 4E), indicating pulmonary congestion and heart
failure. Circulation noradrenaline was slightly increased (Figure 4F).
The pronounced cardiac failure resulted in premature death, with
a mortality rate of 80% at 40 weeks, as shown by Kaplan-Meier
plot (Figure 4G). Of note, cardiomyocytes from mice lacking one
copy of Ugcg (hUgcgfl/- mice) also had significantly reduced levels of
GlcCer and LacCer, markedly impaired heart function, and
increased heart and lung weight (Supplementary material online,
Figure S8).

cardiomyocytes
To gain insight into molecular mechanisms of the heart failure in
hUgcg-/- mice, we did whole-genome RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)

alterations (both up- and down-regulation) in glycosphingolipid
metabolism.

Endolysosomal function and autophagy
are impaired in Ugcg-deficient
cardiomyocytes
Since the RNA-seq analysis showed profound alterations in cellular
trafficking, we first investigated whether glycosphingolipid depletion
in cardiomyocytes affects cellular anterograde trafficking. The transport of the temperature-sensitive VSVG-GFP protein through the
trans-Golgi network to the plasma membrane did not differ between
Ugcg-depleted and control HL-1 cardiomyocytes, indicating that Ugcg
deficiency does not affect anterograde transport in these cells (Figure
6A).
Next, we investigated whether glycosphingolipid depletion in
HL-1 cardiomyocytes affects organelles and structures involved in
retrograde transport. We assessed syntaxin 5 (Stx5), a marker of
endosome-to-Golgi transport26 and of Golgi assembly27; GM130, a
cis-Golgi matrix protein; and TGN46, a trans-Golgi matrix protein by
western blot. Acute depletion of Ugcg significantly reduced GM130
and Stx5 levels, but did not affect the level of TGN46 (Figure 6B), and
also resulted in dispersed Golgi (Figure 6C), which were clearly visible
by electronic microscopy in hearts from young hUgcg-/- mice (Figure
6D). Further analysis revealed that structures positive for LAMP1, a
marker of endolysosomal organelles, were smaller in Ugcg-depleted
cardiomyocytes (Figure 6E). In the presence of chloroquine, an inhibitor of lysosome-autophagosome fusion,28 Ugcg-depleted cardiomyocytes had less LAMP1 staining and smaller LAMP1-positive organelles
than control cells (Figure 6E); the marked reduction in LAMP1 staining was confirmed by western blot analysis (Figure 6F), suggesting
impaired endolysosomal function. Thus, glycosphingolipid depletion
in cardiomyocytes results in defects in endolysosomal trafficking and
in Golgi dispersion.
To determine whether the reduction in glycosphingolipids affects
autophagy, we assessed LC3B as a marker of autophagosomes. Very

.. tion of LC3BII in Ugcg-depleted HL-1 cardiomyocytes both in the ab.. sence and presence of chloroquine (Figure 6F; Supplementary

Discussion
This study shows that the glycosphingolipids GlcCer and LacCer are
present at very low levels in the non-ischaemic human heart, but are
markedly elevated in ischaemic heart disease with left ventricular dysfunction and remodelling. To define the role of glycosphingolipids in
cardiac physiology and function, we generated mice with
cardiomyocyte-specific depletion in glycosphingolipids (hUgcg-/-
mice) and observed a dramatic phenotype-dilated cardiomyopathy
and premature death. Mechanistically, we showed that Ugcg-deficiency results in defective endolysosomal function and autophagy,
leading to severely compromised b-adrenergic signalling. Thus, our
findings suggest that an increased level of glycosphingolipids in the
remodelling heart is a compensatory, beneficial response to facilitate
remodelling and that glycosphingolipids are required to maintain cardiomyocyte structure and function and to preserve normal heart
function (Graphical abstract).
Glycosphingolipids are membrane lipids that are important for cellular structure and function.17,18 The first step of glycosphingolipid
synthesis is the glucosylation of ceramide to form GlcCer, which in
turn is the precursor of 300-400 glycosphingolipids.22 Altered
sphingolipid metabolism with an accumulation of undigested glycosphingolipids in lysosomes due to enzyme deficiency is linked to lysosomal storage disorders, such as Fabry.36 Build-up of
glycosphingolipids in the lysosomes in Fabry disease inhibits lipid
recycling, affecting lipid composition of cellular membranes, which
results in defects in autophagy flux, mitochondrial, and lysosomal
dysfunction.36
The low basal levels of cardiac glycosphingolipids we observed are
consistent with the low expression of Ugcg in heart tissue
(Consensus dataset,25 www.proteinatlas.org (28 June 2021)). During
cardiac remodelling, however, cardiac GlcCer levels were elevated in
both humans and mice. GlcCer was increased in the septum as well
as in the left ventricle, suggesting that this increase is driven by pressure overload or increased uptake of glucose, rather than by the ischaemia/hypoxia per se. However, the exact mechanism for the
elevation in glycosphingolipids following cardiac remodelling remains
to be determined. In addition to the increase in glycosphingolipids in
the remodelling heart, the full lipidomics and metabolomics profiles
revealed numerous rearrangements in the cardiac composition of lipids, amino acids, and other energy substrates. These results highlight
the significance of metabolic regulation of cardiac structure and
function.8
Membrane lipid composition is important for cellular structure
and function, but may be particularly crucial for cardiomyocytes to
maintain their contractile function. Constant cycles of contraction
and relaxation reshape membrane morphology and thereby affect
cardiomechanical signalling.37 Since glycosphingolipids are membrane
lipids, we speculated that cardiac glycosphingolipid levels would increase in response to remodelling. Indeed, mice with cardiomyocytespecific Ugcg deletion (and thus depletion of cardiac glycosphingolipids) developed normally and had normal heart function at baseline,
but had markedly reduced contractile capacity under stress and died
prematurely from heart failure. These findings show that cardiac glycosphingolipids play an important role in heart physiology and function. Even mice with heterozygous deletion of Ugcg had significantly
reduced heart function and developed heart failure, indicating that

indicating a reduced responsiveness to b-adrenergic stimulation. The
reduced cAMP production is not due to reduced mRNA expression
of significant players of the bAR-signalling system, such as b1AR
(adrb1), b2AR (adrb2) or adenylate cyclase 5 (adcy5) (Figure 7C). To
further analyse the potential effects of altered glycosphingolipid concentrations on b-adrenergic signalling, we established HEK293 cells
that stably overexpress the b1AR (HEK-b1AR cells) (Figure 7D), a
well-established model system for bAR-signalling.31-34 Incubation
with isoproterenol markedly increased cAMP generation in these
cells (Figure 7E) and knockdown of Ugcg acutely reduced this response (Figure 7F). These results suggest that the reduced responsiveness of hUgcg-/- cardiomyocytes to isoproterenol is a direct effect of
Ugcg deficiency.
The b1AR is mainly localized in the plasma membrane and is rapidly desensitized and internalized by endocytosis upon agonist stimulation. The receptor is then either resensitized and recycled back to
the plasma membrane by the endolysosomal trafficking system or
degraded.35 Disturbance of any of these steps would impair receptor
signalling. Immunohistochemistry showed clear localization of the
b1AR under basal conditions, with no differences between control
and Ugcg-depleted HEK-b1AR cells (Figure 7G). In response to 25 nM
isoproterenol, the b1AR was internalized in the control cells but not
in Ugcg-depleted cells (Figure 7G). After wash out of the agonist and
60 min of chase, the receptor was again visible in the plasma membrane in the control cells (Figure 7G). To further clarify the localization of the b1AR, we studied the co-localization of the receptor with
endosomal markers. Notably, we found that upon stimulation with
isoproterenol in control cells, the b1AR internalized to the early
endosome (as shown by co-localization with the early endosome
marker early endosome antigen 1), but the b1AR did not localize to
the late endosome (shown with the late endosome marker Rab7). In
Ugcg-depleted cells, however, the main part of the b1ARs maintained
on the plasma membrane upon isoproterenol stimulation, and no colocalization with early endosomes was detected (Supplementary material online, Figure S13).
To verify that the observed defects in endolysosomal trafficking in
Ugcg-depleted cells in fact lead to the defective b1AR-internalization
and signalling, we assessed cAMP production in the presence of diverse inhibitors of endolysomal trafficking. Indeed, pre-incubation
with EGA, a selective inhibitor of endolysosomal trafficking between
the early and late endosome, lead to a significant decrease in the production of cAMP in a similar extent to the one observed upon Ugcg
depletion . However, pre-incubation with brefeldin A (BFA), which is
known to disintegrate the Golgi apparatus and inhibit the retrograde
transport to the ER, or chloroquine (CQ), an inhibitor of the autophagy process that also has been shown to disorganize the Golgi and
endolysosomal systems, did not affect the isoproterenol inducted
cAMP production (Figure 7H). Thus, these results show that the
impaired b1-adrenerigic signalling seen in Ugcg-depleted cardiomyocytes is a consequence of defect endolysosomal trafficking.
In sum, our results suggest that b1AR internalization and recycling
is defective in Ugcg-deficient cells. Once activated, b1ARs in the
plasma membrane are desensitized but are not internalized by endocytosis, resulting in reduced responsiveness to further b-adrenergic
stimulation.

even small reductions in glycosphingolipids can impair cardiomyocyte
function. Our results demonstrating that both elevated cardiac glycosphingolipid levels (as shown in the human remodelling heart with
reduced heart function) as well as reduced cardiac glycosphingolipids
(as shown in the mouse model) correlate with reduced heart function, may seem contrasting and unpredicted. However, these findings
clearly indicate that the preservation of membrane lipids is crucial
and highlight the importance of glycosphingolipid homeostasis in cardiomyocyte membranes. It is therefore plausible that a deranged
sphingolipid metabolism may contribute to the deterioration of cardiac disease.
Our findings indicate that glycosphingolipid homeostasis is crucial
for the cardiomyocyte contractility. Glycosphingolipids, particularly
GlcCer, markedly affect the biophysical properties of cellular membranes.38 Studies of artificial membranes have shown that similarly to
ceramide, GlcCer is able to form tightly packed gel domains in membrane bilayers, but displays a higher tendency to promote membrane
shape changes.39 Our results show that a critical level of glycosphingolipids in cardiomyocyte membranes may be particularly important
under conditions of cardiac stress and hypertrophy, such as cardiac
remodelling. In cardiomyocytes, the membrane connects tightly to
the cytoskeleton,40 indicating that alterations in membrane properties will result in biological actions. In agreement with our findings, it
has been suggested that cardiomyocyte hypertrophy during cardiac
remodelling is both a means to cope with wall stress and part of a
complex feedback system to fine-tune and regulate membranemediated signalling.37
We found that depletion of glycosphingolipids in cardiomyocytes
compromises cellular trafficking by reducing endolysosomal retrograde transport and autophagy. Ugcg deficiency reduced the size of
LAMP1-positive endolysosomes and reduced Stx5 levels, suggesting
defective endosome-to-Golgi transport. Importantly, the Golgi apparatus was dispersed in hearts from young hUgcg-/- mice, even before clear signs of heart failure were present. Our results agree with
previous reports showing that glycosphingolipids are essential for
functional endocytosis, for example in the intestine41 and to enable
influenza virus entry.42 Our results also show that Ugcg-deficiency
results in reduced autophagy through activation of mTORC1, possibly enhancing defects in endolysosomal transport. Indeed, other
membrane lipids, such as cholesterol, have been implicated in endolysosomal function and autophagy.43
Intact b1AR signalling and trafficking are crucial for cardiac function, and defects in this system contribute to heart failure.44
Membrane lipid composition is imperative for the function of bARs
and other G-protein-coupled receptors,18,45 and membrane lipids affect the agonist binding, conformation, internalization, and trafficking
of several G-protein-coupled receptors.46-48 We found that b1ARs
in Ugcg-deficient cardiomyocytes were not internalized after agonist
stimulation; most remained at the cell surface, desensitized and unable to transduce receptor signalling. Furthermore, our results show
that inhibition of endolysosomal trafficking using EGA results in
reduced cAMP production, indicating that the impairment of receptor internalization in glycosphingolipid-depleted cells is due to defective endolysosomal transport between early and late endosomes.
Several studies have shown that disturbance of endosomal trafficking
can lead to disturbed b-adrenergic signalling and reduced cardiac
contraction. Impairments in endocytosis and receptor trafficking lock
