Pulmonary embolism in patients with
COVID-19: incidence, risk factors, clinical
characteristics, and outcome

O. Miro et al.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusions
PE in COVID-19 patients at ED presentation is unusual (about 0.5%), but incidence is approximately ninefold
higher than in the general (non-COVID-19) population. Moreover, risk factors and leg symptoms are less frequent,
D-dimer increase is lower and emboli involve smaller pulmonary arteries. While PE probably does not increase the
mortality of COVID-19 patients, mortality is higher in COVID-19 than in non-COVID-19 patients with PE.

characteristics, and outcomes were made between cases and randomly selected controls (1:1 ratio). We identified
368 PE in 74 814 patients with COVID-19 attending EDs (4.92&). The standardized incidence of PE in the
COVID-19 population resulted in 310 per 100 000 person-years, significantly higher than that observed in the nonCOVID-19 population [35 per 100 000 person-years; odds ratio (OR) 8.95 for PE in the COVID-19 population,
95% confidence interval (CI) 8.51-9.41]. Several characteristics in COVID-19 patients were independently associated with PE, the strongest being D-dimer >1000 ng/mL, and chest pain (direct association) and chronic heart failure (inverse association). COVID-19 patients with PE differed from non-COVID-19 patients with PE in 16 characteristics, most directly related to COVID-19 infection; remarkably, D-dimer >1000 ng/mL, leg swelling/pain, and PE
risk factors were significantly less present. PE in COVID-19 patients affected smaller pulmonary arteries than in
non-COVID-19 patients, although right ventricular dysfunction was similar in both groups. In-hospital mortality in
cases (16.0%) was similar to COVID-19 patients without PE (16.6%; OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.65-1.42; and 11.4% in a
subgroup of COVID-19 patients with PE ruled out by scanner, OR 1.48, 95% CI 0.97-2.27), but higher than in
non-COVID-19 patients with PE (6.5%; OR 2.74, 95% CI 1.66-4.51). Adjustment for differences in baseline and
acute episode characteristics and sensitivity analysis reported very similar associations.

Pulmonary embolism in patients with COVID-19

Introduction

Methods
Study design and setting
This was a retrospective, case-control, ED-based, multicentre study that
reviewed the medical reports of COVID-19 patients attending 62
Spanish EDs (around 20% of public Spanish EDs) who were diagnosed as
having objective PE during ED assessment and management, before hospitalization (cases). These 62 EDs have a reference population of 15 094
000 people, which constitutes about 32% of the whole Spanish population (46.9 million). In Spain, the first case of SARS-CoV-2 infection was
detected on 31 January 2020 and, accordingly, the definition of the
COVID-19 period for patient inclusion in the present study was set from
1 March to 30 April 2020. During this 61-day period, 213 435 cases of
COVID-19 were confirmed by the Spanish Ministry of Health.4 The present study forms part of the Unusual Manifestations of Covid-19 (UMC19) project, which was designed to investigate the potential relationship
between COVID-19 and 10 different entities that could be influenced by
SARS-CoV-2 infection. Complete details of the UMC-19 project have
been published elsewhere.5,6 Study 9 of the UMC-19 project (UMC-19S9; present study) was designed to specifically investigate PE. Figure 1
resumes the design and patient inclusion flow chart of the UMC-19-S9.

Cases of the UMC-19-S9
The case group was formed by all COVID-19 patients diagnosed with PE
during ED stay in March-April 2020. The diagnosis was initially made by
radiologists reporting the results of the computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) ordered during ED patient care. A second review

of CTPA was carried out by radiologists at a local level to confirm the initial diagnosis of PE and to define the location of clots (unilobar or multiple
location in lungs; central or peripheral location in vessel lumen)
in patients with PE exclusively limited to subsegmental arteries. The
diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in a
nasopharyngeal swab by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR), a clinically compatible clinical picture, or the presence of the
typical lung parenchymal infiltrates in chest X-ray or CTPA in patients
with some clinical symptoms attributable to COVID-19.

Controls of the UMC-19-S9
We defined three control groups. One group was formed by COVID-19
patients without PE attending the ED during the same period of cases.
Selection was randomly performed by the inclusion of a COVID-19 patient seen immediately before or after each case included by the centre
(case: control ratio of 1:1). Patients included in this group (control group
A1) had no clinical evidence of PE, and only 11% of them had a CTPA ruling out PE. In contrast, the second group (control group A2) was formed
by COVID-19 patients in whom PE had been excluded by CTPA in all
cases (case: control ratio of 1:1). The third group (control group B) was
made up of non-COVID-19 patients with a diagnosis of PE attending the
ED during the same period as the cases (1 March to 30 April 2020) as
well as from 1 March to 30 April 2019, just 1 year before the COVID-19
pandemic. This control group was formed by selecting one non-COVID19 patient with PE for every case detected by the centre (case:control
ratio of 1:1), which was randomly selected from the complete list of nonCOVID-19 patients diagnosed with PE during these two periods.

Independent variables
We collected 21 variables related to baseline characteristics and 38 variables related to the acute episode. Drugs used in the ED to treat COVID19 and anticoagulants were specifically recorded. In patients with PE
(cases and control group B), we also recorded the main findings of the
CTPA: type of pulmonary artery where thrombi were located (main pulmonary arteries, lobar arteries, segmental or subsegmental arteries); location of clots in lungs (unilobar or multilobar) and in vessel lumen
(central or peripheral) in patients with subsegmental PE; number of lungs
affected by PE (uni- or bilateral); and the presence of indirect data of right
ventricular dysfunction (RVD). In addition, we also recorded data of deep
vein thrombosis (DVT) in legs if this was explored, either by complete
compression Doppler ultrasound or by computed tomography (CT) during lung examination by CTPA. For patients in whom echocardiography
was performed during ED stay, we also recorded the presence of RVD.

Outcomes
We defined three different outcomes: (i) the need to be admitted to an
intensive care unit (ICU); (ii) prolonged hospitalization (longer than
7 days); and (iii) all-cause in-hospital mortality. We also specifically investigated causes of death in patients with PE, which were divided into cardiovascular, non-cardiovascular or unknown according to the Academic
Research Consortium-2 (ARC-2) consensus.7

Statistical analysis
The relative frequency of PE in COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients
coming to the ED was expressed as cases per thousand (&) with 95%
confidence intervals (CI). Standardized incidences (cases per 100,000
person per year) were calculated based on the catchment area of the 62
EDs involved in the study. To estimate COVID-19 and non-COVID-19
populations in each ED catchment area, we used the Spanish provincial
SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalences determined between 27 April 27 and 11
May 2020.8 Discrete variables were expressed as absolute values and

Infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) is mainly characterized by fever and respiratory symptoms, with
dyspnoea and lung infiltrates in more severe cases. Many patients also present a pro-coagulant state, which is biochemically detected by increased
D-dimer levels and is related to complications and a worse prognosis.1 In
this context, a recent Cochrane review identified 16 large reports including 7700 COVID-19 cases of venous thromboembolism, with an estimated weighted mean incidence of 7.4%.2 Nonetheless, many cases of
pulmonary embolism (PE) in COVID-19 patients occurred after hospitalization, and as hospitalization itself usually increases complications in bedridden patients with multidrug treatment or in very poor condition, it is
difficult to know if SARS-CoV-2 has a pathogenic role in PE development.
In addition, irregular initiation of thromboprophylaxis in hospitalized
patients during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic makes it difficult
to interpret the real risk of PE associated with COVID-19. Focus on
patients with COVID-19 at emergency department (ED) arrival, before
patient hospitalization, could help to answer this question. On the other
hand, there are few large series of PE cases carried out in COVID-19
patients describing clinical characteristics and risk factors, or their potential
impact on prognosis.2,3 Bearing all these gaps in mind, we designed the
current study with the following specific objectives: (i) to determine the
relative frequency of PE in patients with COVID-19 coming to the ED
and estimate the standardized incidence in the general population; (ii) to
uncover the risk factors associated with the development of PE in patients
with COVID-19; (iii) to describe whether there is any distinctive clinical
characteristic in these patients in comparison with PE observed in nonCOVID-19 patients; and (iv) to investigate the outcome of COVID-19
patients presenting with PE.

percentages, and continuous variables as median and interquartile range.
Differences between case and control groups were assessed by the chisquare test (or Fisher exact test if needed) for qualitative variables, with
previous dichotomization of the continuous variables using clinically
meaningful cut-offs or values around the median. Adjusted odds ratios
(OR) with 95% CI were calculated in a multivariable model including all
the variables with statistically significant differences between groups
found in the univariable analysis. Discriminative capacity for PE identification in COVID-19 patients of the model containing all the independent
significant variables was estimated using the c-statistic. Beta coefficients
obtained in the multivariate logistic regression were used to assign a
unique score to every patient. The same adjustment strategy was used
for estimations of outcomes, with quantitative variables entered as continuous variables. As the number of events was not expected to be larger,
adjustment was performed twice, once using baseline variables and again
using acute episode variables. To manage missing values in the variables
included in the adjustment, we used a multiple imputation technique provided by SPSS to generate five new datasets without missing data. We
also ran a sensitivity analysis of all comparisons by including only COVID19 patients of the case group and control groups A1 and A2 with microbiological confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR. Statistical
significance was accepted if P-value was <0.05, 95% CI of the OR

group. A second review of CTPA confirmed all PEs, although five subsegmental PEs were reclassified as segmental. Control group A1 was
formed by 368 randomly selected COVID-19 patients without PE
attending the ED during the same period, while control group A2
was formed by 368 COVID-19 randomly selected patients in whom
PE was excluded by CTPA. COVID-19 infection was confirmed by
RT-PCR in 271 cases, in 271 control group A1 patients (73.6% in
both groups, P = 1.00) and in 275 control group A2 patients (74.7%,
P = 0.74).
On the other hand, 1 388 879 non-COVID-19 patients were seen
during the 122-day period (423 153 during the 61 days in the 2020
COVID-19 period, and 965 726 during the 61 days in the 2019 preCOVID-19 period). Of these, 1707 were diagnosed with PE (717 in
the COVID-19 period, and 990 in the pre-COVID-19 period).
Accordingly, the overall relative frequency was 1.23& (95% CI 1.17-
1.29) with a COVID-19 period relative frequency of 1.69& (95% CI
1.57-1.82) and a pre-COVID-19 period relative frequency of 1.02&
(95% CI 0.96-1.09). A sample of 368 of these patients randomly
selected constituted control group B (165 corresponding to the preCOVID-19 period and 205 to the COVID-19 period-89% having a
negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR). After the second CTPA review, all
PEs were confirmed, and one was reclassified from the subsegmental
to the segmental category.

The overall standardized incidences of PE were 310.1 per 100 000
..
.. COVID-19 individuals per year (95% CI 297.3-323.3) and 34.7 per
.. 100 000 non-COVID-19 individuals per year (95% CI 33.8-35.7; with
..
.. partial standard incidences of 28.5 in the COVID-19 period and 41.3
.. in the pre-COVID-19 period). Accordingly, the OR for PE in
..
.. COVID-19 patients compared to non-COVID-19 patients was of
.. 8.95 (95% CI 8.51-9.41) (OR 7.53 compared to the COVID-19
..

.. 19 period, 95% CI 10.67-11.49).
..
..
.. Risk factors for PE in COVID-19 patients
.. The median age of COVID-19 patients with PE (cases) was 66 years;
..
.. 58% were males, and 33% had at least one risk factor for PE. Other
.. common comorbidities were hypertension (49%), dyslipidemia
..
.. (36%) and diabetes mellitus (18%) (Table 1). The most frequent
.. symptoms were dyspnoea (72%), cough (48%) and fever (45%), while

.. chest pain was referred by 30% of cases, leg swelling or pain by 14%,
.. syncope by 4% and hemoptisis by 2% (Table 2). The abnormalities in

chest X-ray, while cardiomegaly and pleural effusion were only present in 8% of cases each. The frequency of the remaining findings
related to the acute episode is shown in Table 2.
Cases differed in 19 (with respect to control group A1) and 22
(with respect to control group A2) out of the 48 baseline and acute
episode characteristics (Tables 1 and 2). Of these characteristics, 12
and 11, respectively, were independently associated with PE in
COVID-19 patients in the adjusted models (Figure 2), with c-statistics
for PE prediction in COVID-19 patients of 0.84 (0.80-0.87) and 0.77
(0.73-0.81), respectively. Remarkably, six of these independent characteristics were common in both comparisons (with control groups
A1 and A2), with D-dimer levels >1000 ng/mL, chest pain, and leg
swelling or pain showing direct associations, and cough, fever, and
chronic heart failure showing inverse associations. Although there
were no differences in the proportion of cases and control groups
A1 or A2 having atrial fibrillation, atrial fibrillation was more frequently present in patients with than without chronic heart failure (28.2%
vs. 6.3%, P < 0.001). Very similar results were found in the sensitivity
analysis restricted to the 271 cases and 271 and 275 patients of control groups A1 and A2, respectively, with microbiological confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 2).

Distinctive clinical characteristics of PE
in COVID-19 patients
Cases differed from non-COVID-19 patients with PE in 35 out of
the 48 clinical characteristics (Tables 1 and 2). Many of the differences were mainly directly related to COVID-19 infection. After adjustment, 16 characteristics remained statistically significant, the

..
.. strongest being ground-glass opacities and bilateral interstitial infil.. trates on chest X-ray (OR 5.65, 95% CI 3.37-9.47 and OR 4.30, 95%
..
.. CI 2.20-8.40, respectively), diarrhoea and fever as clinical complaints
.. (OR 4.96, 95% CI 1.57-15.7 and OR 4.29, 95% CI 2.31-7.95, re..
.. spectively), and previous thromboembolic disease and chronic oes.. trogen therapy (OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.09-0.34 and OR 0.10, 95% CI
..
.. 0.03-0.36, respectively). Remarkably, D-dimer levels >1000 ng/mL,
.. leg swelling/pain, and active cancer were also significantly less pre..
.. sent in cases (Figure 2).
..
In patients with PE, the main pulmonary arteries were more fre..
.. quently involved in non-COVID-19 patients, while thrombi were
.. more frequently restricted to segmental or subsegmental arteries in
..
.. COVID-19 patients (Figure 3). Nonetheless, no significant differences
.. were found in lung or vessel clot location in subsegmental PE of
..
.. COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. RVD was similar in
.. COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients, and leg DVT (wherever or
..
.. proximal) was also similar in both groups.
..
..
..
.. Treatments started at the emergency
.. department
..
.. Cases received some drugs related to COVID-19 more frequently
.. than control group A1 patients, but at a similar frequency to that
..
.. of control group A2 patients (Table 3). Low-molecular-weight hep.. arin was used in 97% of patients with PE (89% at high dosage).
..
.. Anticoagulant therapy was used equally in COVID-19 and in non..
.. COVID-19 patients with PE (Table 3). We observed a peak of PE
.. diagnosis in COVID-19 patients during late March and early April
..
.. 2020 (coinciding with the highest peak of COVID-19 diagnosis dur.. ing the first pandemic wave in Spain4), but no differences were
..
.. observed in the use of anticoagulant therapy along the study
.. period (Figure 4).
..
..
..
.. Outcomes
.. ICU admission was significantly higher in cases than in the control group
..
.. A1 patients (18.0% vs. 6.5%; OR 3.19, 95% CI 1.95-5.21) and control
.. group A2 patients (18.0% vs. 11.4%; OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.14-2.62) and
..
.. these differences remained significant after adjustments (Figure 5).
.. Conversely, we did not find statistically significant differences in mortality
..
.. between cases and control group A1 patients (16.0% vs. 16.6%; OR
..
.. 0.96, 95% CI 0.65-1.42) and control group A2 patients (16.0% vs. 11.4%;
.. OR 1.48, 95% CI 0.97-2.27). Adjusted models did not change these esti..
.. mations, except for comparison with control group A2 patients adjusted
.. for baseline characteristics (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.05-2.55).
..
On the other hand, in-hospital mortality of cases was higher than
..
.. in control group B patients (6.5%; OR 2.74, 95% CI 1.66-4.51), and
..
.. this increased mortality remained statistically significant after adjust.. ment for differences in baseline (OR 3.66, 95% CI 2.12-6.31) and
..
.. acute episode (OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.15-4.13) characteristics. The
.. causes of death of patients with PE could be classified in all but six

Discussion
The UMC-19-S9 reports four main findings needing to be highlighted,
summarized in Graphical Abstract. First, PE is relatively uncommon as
a manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection before patient hospitalization (0.5%); however, when we consider standardized incidence per
year, this is almost 9-fold greater in the COVID-19 than in the non-

COVID-19 population. Second, D-dimer levels >1000 ng/mL and
chest pain as a clinical complaint were the strongest risk factors directly associated with PE development in COVID-19 patients. Third,
COVID-19 patients with PE differed from non-COVID-19 patients
with PE mainly in the clinical characteristics directly related to
COVID-19 infection, although, remarkably, they had fewer risk factors for PE, complained less frequently of leg swelling/pain, exhibited
a more discrete rise in D-dimers, and thrombi affected smaller pulmonary arteries. Fourth, the mortality was high (one in six patients
died during hospitalization), being more than double the number
observed in the general population (non-COVID-19) with PE.
Conversely, no statistical differences were found in in-hospital

.. percentage of patients. This suggests that some PE could develop in
.. situ in lungs, favoured by a highly inflammatory involvement and, in
..
.. fact, in situ immunothrombosis has been proposed to play a role in
.. the pathophysiology of COVID-19-associated PE.14 In this sense, al..
.. veolar injury and the inflammatory storm present during COVID-19
.. pneumonia along with disruption of the thrombo-protective state of
..
.. the pulmonary vascular endothelial cells might contribute to the for.. mation of deep small vessel thrombi. We made a second review of
..
.. CTPA for adjudication of morphological vascular findings, with special
.. focus on lumen location of thrombi placed in small pulmonary
..
.. arteries, in order to figure this hypothesis out. Nonetheless, our
.. study does not provide definitive data on this regard: while anatomic..
.. al involvement of smaller pulmonary arteries would support the hy.. pothesis of a local (lung) process in PE developed in COVID-19
..
.. patients, no differences were found in clot location in subsegmental
.. PEs. Finally, it is remarkable that involvement of smaller pulmonary
..
.. arteries (segmental or subsegmental) does not translate in a different
.. severity of PE with respect to the general population, as we found a
..
.. similar proportion of patients with PE presenting RVD.
..
When outcomes were analysed, the need for ICU care was clearly
..
.. increased in COVID-19 patients with PE compared to COVID-19
..
.. patients without PE, in agreement with a previous study by Fauvel
.. et al.3 in 24 French hospitals. Conversely, our results were more in..
.. conclusive for in-hospital mortality. Overall, we did not find significant
.. increments in mortality, in line with the results reported by Fauvel
..
.. et al.3 However, while the mortality was similar when compared with
.. COVID-19 patients in whom PE was mainly excluded on the basis of
..
.. clinical findings, it showed a trend to increase when compared with
.. COVID-19 patients in whom PE was excluded using CTPA in all
..
.. cases, and even achieved statistical significance after adjustment for
.. baseline characteristics. It is difficult to decide which of these two
..
.. control groups of COVID-19 patients without PE is better for making
.. comparisons since while the former could include some patients hav..
.. ing PE in whom PE was not diagnosed during ED management, the
.. latter could include less sick patients in whom lung scans were rou..
.. tinely performed to detect parenchymal lung involvement by
.. COVID-19. Accordingly, caution is recommended when interpreting
..
.. the impact of PE on mortality in COVID-19 patients, as it is difficult
.. to isolate the adverse effects (death, in this case) of COVID-19 (es..
.. sentially lung involvement due to inflammation and hyperimmune re.. action) from the adverse effects of PE. On the other hand, the
..
.. mortality was higher in COVID-19 than in non-COVID-19 patients
.. with PE, but the causes of death were not significantly different be..
.. tween the two groups. Although part or all of this increase could be
..
.. related to severe COVID-19 (with lung parenchymal involvement
.. and secondary respiratory failure), the true role of PE in determining
..
.. poor outcomes in COVID-19 patients remains to be elucidated.
..
..
.. Limitations
.. This study has several limitations. First, PE was only detected if CT
..
.. was performed in the ED. However, during the COVID-19 pandem.. ic, emergency physicians had a very low threshold for ordering chest
..
.. imaging. Second, undiagnosed PE might have been present, although
.. radiologists reviewed all the imaging studies, making this possibility
..
.. very unlikely. Third, we did not quantify the number of CTPA per.. formed in COVID-19 patients; therefore, the proportion of CTPA
..
. positivity in unknown. However, a recent analysis has shown that,

mortality of COVID-19 patients with and without PE; therefore, PE
should not be considered as a risk factor for death in patients with
COVID-19.
Our estimation of the standardized incidence of PE of 35 per 100
000 person-years in the general (non-COVID-19) population (41
considering only the pre-COVID-19 period, when fear of COVID-19
contagion in EDs was not present) is close to that reported in previous studies: 69 in the USA in the period from 1966 to 1990 (with a
progressive decline over time being noticed),9 50 in Norway in the
period from 1995 to 2001,10 and 38 in Canada in the period from
2002 to 2012 (with a stable incidence over time),11 which makes our
estimation quite reliable. Therefore, the incidence of PE of 310 per
100 000 person-years found in COVID-19 patients strongly suggests
that SARS-CoV-2 is associated with a marked and significant increment in the risk of PE and could have a direct potential pathogenic
role in the development of PE. Nonetheless, our results must be
interpreted with caution, as they could be biased by the particular circumstances of the first pandemic wave, including population lockdown, the high number of CTPA ordered in COVID-19 patients
(making the diagnosis of PE easier and more frequent) and the fact
that non-COVID-19 patients with small PEs could have been less
diagnosed as they stayed at home (due to fear of contagion in EDs)
or were less frequently explored with CTPA if they complained of
non-specific symptoms. However, as difference in standardized incidences in both populations was very large (OR 8.95), and as the OR
for PE in COVID-19 patients was also very high when compared with
PE diagnosed in non-COVID-19 patients during the pre-COVID-19
period (OR 10.91), and lastly, as nearly half of PE in COVID-19
patients involved the main or lobar pulmonary arteries (only 12%
were very small PEs, affecting exclusively subsegmental arteries), we
believe that there really is an increase in the incidence of PE in
patients with COVID-19.
Our comparison between COVID-19 patients with and without
PE was performed before hospitalization and, accordingly, it did not
take into account the secondary effects of being bedridden for a long
time and/or intubation that can adversely affect hospitalized patients
and favour thromboembolic disease. In this scenario of ED, COVID19 patients complaining of chest pain and having D-dimer levels over
1000 ng/mL were at increased risk of having PE. D-dimers are a classical biomarker of PE in the general population, although cut-off
adjustments must be made in a number of situations, the most relevant being patient age.12 Similarly, it is possible that a specific D-dimer
cut-off value for COVID-19 patients is needed, as non-specific mild
increments of D-dimer are usually observed in such a population.1
On the other hand, the inverse association of PE with chronic heart
failure found in the present study is striking, and contrasts with previously reported data identifying chronic heart failure as a risk factor
for PE.13 We can hypothesize two potential explanations for our finding: the competing risk of death or the higher presence of atrial fibrillation in chronic heart failure patients (in our series, 28.2% compared
to 6.3% in the rest of patients; P < 0.001). Atrial fibrillation usually
associates a high use of oral anticoagulants and this could have been,
in fact, the factor related to the apparent protective effect of chronic
heart failure for development of PE in COVID-19 patients.
It was of note that leg swelling/pain and risk factors for PE were significantly less present in COVID-19 than in non-COVID-19 patients
with PE, despite DVT and proximal DVT being diagnosed in a similar

Conclusions
The UMC-19-S9 demonstrates that PE in COVID-19 patients is unusual (about 0.5%) at ED presentation, but standardized incidence is
about 9-fold higher than expected in the general (non-COVID-19)
population. PE by itself probably does not increase in-hospital mortality of the COVID-19 population presenting to the ED. As risk factors
and leg symptoms are less frequent, and the increase in D-dimer is
lower than in non-COVID-19 patients developing PE, a red flag
should be raised by any treating physicians assessing COVID-19
patients in order to detect PE in these patients, and to promptly start
specific anticoagulant treatment, as recent data show that this is a
safe treatment that should be provided to COVID-19 patients with
PE.19

once PE is suspected in the ED and a CTPA is ordered, acute PE is
diagnosed in the same proportion of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19
patients.15 Fourth, we did not adjust the incidence of PE in COVID19 by patient-related or disease-related factors that could have
accounted for the increased risk of PE diagnosis with respect to nonCOVID-19 patients. In this sense, non-COVID-19 patients with small
size PE and/or mild symptoms could have avoided the ED visit for
health care due to fear of SARS-CoV-2 contagion as has been
reported for patients with acute coronary syndromes and acute cardiovascular diseases in general.16,17 However, the almost 9-fold excess of the standardized incidence in PE in COVID-19 with respect
to the non-COVID-19 population makes unlikely that adjustments
could even correct for such a huge difference. Fifth, estimations of
standardized incidences did not take into account PE developed or
discovered once the patient was already hospitalized. However, this
possibility would further increase the differences in the incidence of
PE between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. Sixth, in many
cases the diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on clinical and/or radiological findings, with no microbiological confirmation due to shortage
of diagnostic tests experienced in Spain during the first pandemic
wave,18 and a few of patients with PE included in the COVID-19
period could have been misclassified with respect to their COVID-19
status. This limitation was managed by performing a sensitivity analysis limited to patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, which
showed very similar results as the main analysis. Seventh, as a retrospective study, although the case record form was standardized,
there was no monitoring of data collection methods and diagnosis,
and outcomes were locally adjudicated. Eighth, as treatments provided during hospitalization were not recorded, the impact of inappropriate management on outcomes was not assessed in the
present study. Finally, the UMC-19-S9 was performed during the first
wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. As the mortality has shifted lower
and new variants of the SARS-CoV-2 have emerged, we do not know
if our reported findings will endure in the subsequent waves.
