Aims

Whether isolated diastolic hypertension (IDH), as defined by the 2017 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/
American Heart Association (AHA) guideline, is associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been disputed.
We aimed to further study the associations of IDH with (i) subclinical CVD in the form of coronary artery calcium
(CAC), (ii) incident systolic hypertension, and (iii) CVD events.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
We used multivariable-adjusted logistic and Cox regression to test whether IDH by 2017 ACC/AHA criteria (i.e.
systolic blood pressure <130 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure >_80 mmHg) was associated with the above outand results

comes in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). In a random-effects meta-analysis of the association between IDH and CVD events, we combined the MESA results with those from seven other previously published cohort studies. Among the 5104 MESA participants studied, 7.5% had IDH by the 2017 ACC/AHA criteria. There
was no association between IDH and CAC [e.g. adjusted prevalence odds ratio for CAC >0 of 0.88 (95% CI 0.66,
1.17)]. Similarly, while IDH was associated with incident systolic hypertension, there was no statistically significant
associations with incident CVD [hazard ratio 1.19 (95% CI 0.77, 1.84)] or death [hazard ratio 0.94 (95% CI 0.65,
1.36)] over 13 years in MESA. In a stratified meta-analysis of eight cohort studies (10 037 843 participants), the
2017 IDH definition was also not consistently associated with CVD and the relative magnitude of any potential association was noted to be numerically small [e.g. depending on inclusion criteria applied in the stratification, the
adjusted hazard ratios ranged from 1.04 (95% CI 0.98, 1.10) to 1.09 (95% 1.03, 1.15)].

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
The lack of consistent excess in CAC or CVD suggests that emphasis on healthy lifestyle rather than drug therapy
is sufficient among the millions of middle-aged or older adults who now meet the 2017 ACC/AHA criteria for
IDH, though they require follow-up for incident systolic hypertension. These findings may not extrapolate to adults
younger than 40 years, motivating further study in this age group.

Introduction
Observational studies have shown that elevations in both systolic
blood pressure (BP) and diastolic BP are associated with increased
risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD).1 Randomized clinical trial data
support therapeutically reducing diastolic BP to <90 mmHg2 and systolic BP to <120 mmHg in appropriately selected adults.3 Although
current European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines continue to
define hypertension as BP >_140/90 mmHg,4 the 2017 American
College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA)
guideline for the management of hypertension revised the definition
to >_130/80 mmHg.5 While the lower systolic BP threshold is based
on a number of lines of compelling evidence,3 the lower diastolic BP
threshold in US guidelines (i.e., 80 mmHg) was recommended based
on expert opinion. This lower diastolic BP threshold increases the
proportion of adults (e.g. an increase of >10 million in America6)
now eligible for a diagnosis of hypertension based solely on the presence of isolated diastolic hypertension (IDH), despite having systolic
BP <130 mmHg. Specifically, IDH is now defined as a systolic BP
<130 mmHg with a diastolic BP >_80 mmHg in America but continues

to be defined as a systolic BP <140 with a diastolic BP >_90 mmHg in
Europe.
There is uncertainty about whether IDH is independently associated with adverse clinical outcomes. While several analyses of the
ESC definition of IDH have not found any association with CVD,7-12
a number of others have.13-16 Complicating matters further, relatively few analyses of the 2017 ACC/AHA definition of IDH have been
undertaken to date, with five cohorts demonstrating no increased
CVD risk after adjustment6,16,17 and three cohorts suggesting a smallto-modest association.15,18-20 There has also been heterogeneity in
the conduct of these studies, with the studies suggesting an association all using BP obtained during usual clinical practice but the studies finding no association using BP readings obtained under more
reliable and valid research conditions.21 This is relevant because diastolic BP is difficult to measure accurately.22 As such, some controversy exists as to whether IDH (particularly by the 2017 ACC/AHA
definition) increases risk for CVD, a question that is important to
clarify given it has implications for millions of adults.
Because IDH is a relatively small subset of hypertension and because persons with IDH are often middle-aged or younger (and less

In the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), isolated diastolic hypertension (IDH) by the 2014 ACC/AHA definition is associated with future development of systolic hypertension but is not significantly associated with coronary artery calcification (CAC) or cardiovascular disease (CVD) events.
These MESA results were added to a meta-analysis of prior reports on the association between IDH by the 2017 ACC/AHA definition and CVD events,
finding that no consistent association was found, particularly when studies were stratified by the quality of blood pressure measurement.

A cohort study and meta-analysis of isolated diastolic hypertension

Methods
Study participants
Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis is a community-based cohort study
of the prevalence, correlates, and progression of subclinical and clinical
CVD. Comprehensive details of the MESA study are reported elsewhere.27 Briefly, 6814 participants between the ages of 45 and 84 without
clinical CVD at baseline were enrolled between 2000 and 2002 (i.e.
MESA visit 1) at six US field centres (Baltimore, MD; Chicago, IL; Forsyth
County, NC; Los Angeles, CA; New York, NY; and St Paul, MN). Five further follow-up visits were conducted between 2002 and 2018. For this
analysis, we excluded participants with systolic hypertension at baseline
(defined as systolic BP >_140 mmHg in analyses of the ESC definition of
IDH and systolic BP >_130 mmHg in analyses of the 2017 ACC/AHA definition) (Figure 1). This study was approved by the institutional review
boards at each centre and all participants provided written informed
consent.

Baseline demographic and clinical variables
At the baseline examination, self-reported information was collected pertaining to demographics, lipid-lowering and anti-hypertensive medication
use, cigarette smoking, and alcohol use using standardized questionnaires.
Information on race was self-reported (selected from several fixed categories defined by the investigators). Diabetes mellitus was defined as a
fasting blood glucose concentration of >_126 mg/dL, self-report, or the
use of insulin or oral hypoglycaemic medications. Systolic and diastolic
BPs were measured three times after 5 min of seated rest using a
Dinamap Pro-10028 automated oscillometric sphygmomanometer
(Dinamap, Critikon, Tampa, FL, USA), and the mean of the last two measurements was used for analyses. Body mass index, fasting lipid panel, and
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) calculated from creatinine
using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKDEPI) equation, were also measured.

Coronary artery calcium
Coronary artery calcium was measured in all participants at Exam 1. Each
of the six MESA centres evaluated CAC with the use of an electron-

beam computed tomography (CT) scanner or a multi-detector CT system following standard protocols and all images were interpreted at a single CT reading centre (LA Biomedical Research Institute at Harbor-
UCLA Medical Center, Torrance, CA, USA). Follow-up CAC measurements were performed on half the cohort (randomly selected) at a second examination (September 2002 through January 2004) and the other
half of the cohort at a third examination (March 2004 through July 2005)
at an average of 1.6 and 3.2 years after the participant's first examination,
respectively. For the cardiac CTs performed during MESA examinations,
each participant was scanned twice and the mean CAC score of the two
scans was used. Intra-observer and inter-observer agreements were excellent (j statistics, 0.93 and 0.90, respectively), and the intra-class correlation coefficient for the Agatston score was 0.99.

Incident systolic or treated hypertension
We defined this outcome as new anti-hypertensive drug therapy over
follow-up or new systolic hypertension (i.e. systolic BP >_140 mmHg in
analyses of the ESC definition of IDH and systolic BP >_130 mmHg in analyses of the 2017 ACC/AHA definition). Because this outcome required
the physical measurement of BP using the Dinamap Pro-100 device as
part of follow-up MESA study visits, follow-up for this outcome ended at
the last MESA study visit a given participant attended. Persons on baseline
anti-hypertensive medication (numbers available in Table 1) were
excluded from analyses of this particular outcome.

Follow-up for incident clinical outcomes in
Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis
At 9- to 12-month intervals, participants or a family member were contacted to inquire about outpatient visits, hospital admissions, and deaths.
Self-reported diagnoses were verified using medical records of outpatient
visits and hospitalizations. For deaths, interviews with the next of kin and
death certificates were used for verification. Two physicians from the
MESA mortality and morbidity review committee independently classified
events.
Both myocardial infarction and stroke were adjudicated. A diagnosis of
myocardial infarction was based on symptoms, electrocardiogram, and
levels of cardiac biomarkers. If a death occurred within 28 days of a myocardial infarction, if the participant had chest pain 72 h before death, or if
the participant had known coronary heart disease and no other noncardiac cause of death; then a death was considered to be due to coronary heart disease.
A stroke was considered to be present if there was a focal neurologic
deficit lasting 24 h or until death, or if <24 h, there was a clinically relevant
lesion on brain imaging and no non-vascular cause. Self-reported diagnoses of stroke were verified with medical records of outpatient visits, hospital records, and death certificates. For fatal events, International
Classification of Diseases revision codes of all deaths were reviewed by
study staff. We used the composite outcome of hard CVD, defined as
myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease death, cerebrovascular accident (CVA, transient ischaemic attack or ischaemic or haemorrhagic
stroke), death from CVA, and other CVD death.
In post hoc sensitivity analyses, we also evaluated other incident outcomes pertinent to known complications of hypertension: chronic kidney
disease, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. A full description of the adjudication process of events is described elsewhere.27

Statistical analyses
For the MESA analysis, IDH was defined by both the traditional (ESC) BP
cut-off (SBP <140 mmHg and DBP >_90 mmHg) and the new ACC/AHA
2017 definition (SBP <130 mmHg and DBP >_80 mmHg). For analyses of
IDH by the ESC definition, the reference group was defined as BP <140/

likely to suffer events), a criticism of the prior null observational studies is that they may have been underpowered to detect associations
between IDH and CVD events.15 Consequently, studies evaluating
the association between IDH and subclinical markers for CVD may
provide the additional power necessary to further probe the clinical
implications of IDH; information that is especially needed for the new
2017 ACC/AHA definition of IDH. One such subclinical marker is
coronary artery calcium (CAC), which is established as the strongest
subclinical marker of risk for incident CVD events in a number of primary prevention populations.23-25 Therefore, we conducted analyses
in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) to test the association of IDH with CAC. We then tested the association of IDH
with clinical CVD events in this contemporary multi-ethnic sample.
We augmented this MESA analysis of CVD outcomes by conducting
a meta-analysis of all the observational studies to date reporting on
the association of IDH by the 2017 ACC/AHA definition and CVD
events. Finally, because IDH by the more traditional ESC definition
has been shown to be associated with incident systolic hypertension,26 we studied whether the same was true for IDH by the 2017
ACC/AHA definition.

90 mmHg. For analyses of IDH by the 2017 ACC/AHA definition,
the reference group was BP <130/80 mmHg. The prevalence of
IDH at visit 1, using both definitions, was described. Baseline
characteristics were compared across the various BP categories using
analysis of variance for continuous variables and chi-squared testing for
proportions.
Next, the cross-sectional categorical association of IDH with baseline
CAC >0 (assessed at visit 1) was characterized in MESA with logistic regression. The first model was unadjusted. The second model was adjusted
for age, sex, race/ethnicity, body mass index (kg/m2), smoking
(current, former, never), alcohol consumption (current, former, or
never), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (mg/dL), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (mg/dL), triglycerides (mg/dL), eGFR, BP-lowering
medication (yes/no), and history of diagnosed diabetes (yes/no). The third
model included all variables in Model 2 plus baseline (visit 1) systolic
BP. Using linear regression, we repeated cross-sectional analyses
testing for any continuous association between IDH and log(CAC th 1).
This log(CAC th 1) transformation is standard when using CAC as a continuous dependent variable in linear regression, given the high proportion
of CAC = 0 in any sample and the positive skew of values for those
with CAC >0. Using log-binomial regression, with adjustments as
described above, we also tested the association of IDH with incident
CAC >0 (detected at either MESA visit 2 or visit 3) among those with
CAC = 0 at visit 1.

We then characterized the prospective association of baseline IDH
(both definitions) with incident systolic or treated hypertension (assessed
at each MESA follow-up visit) using Cox models adjusted for covariates
as described above; except in this analysis we also excluded persons on
baseline BP therapy and, therefore, this variable was not included in
Model 2. To examine associations with clinical events, Kaplan-Meier plots
were generated to visually demonstrate the survival functions by categories of IDH vs. normotension. Furthermore, we conducted analyses of incident CVD, death, and other outcomes using Cox models that were
also adjusted for the covariates described above in models 1 through 3.
The proportional hazards assumption was examined using log-(-log) plots
and by testing risk factor-by-time interactions. Each analysis was then
repeated after stratification by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and hypertension
treatment status (with testing also for statistical interaction). We also
conducted a sensitivity analysis analysing incident CVD or death in Model
3, but with updated anti-hypertensive and lipid-lowering therapies as
time-varying covariables in the model.
Finally, using data from the most completely adjusted models reported,
we conducted a stratified meta-analysis of the adjusted association between IDH when defined by the 2017 ACC/AHA definition and CVD
events, in MESA and in the seven previously published cohort studies (eight
cohorts in total). To inform this meta-analysis, systematic review was performed in accordance with the Cochrane Collaboration and the Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA)

and I2 >25% were considered significant. We used a random-effects model

the BP assessment method used in the studies included (i.e. either using
research-grade BP measurement or including routine BP recordings clinically collected for electronic health databases). All analyses were conducted

using the ESC definition and CAC >0 at baseline [odds ratio 1.23; 95%
confidence interval (CI) 0.63, 2.42; P = 0.54, Model 3] (Table 2).
However, the point estimate suggests a trend for increased risk with
this definition. In contrast, the lack of a significant cross-sectional association between the 2017 ACC/AHA definition of IDH and baseline
CAC >0 was more robust statistically (odds ratio 0.88; 95% CI 0.66,
1.17; P = 0.37). Similarly, comparing persons with and without IDH
using the 2017 ACC/AHA definition, adjusted linear regression demonstrated no difference in mean CAC when modelled as a continuous
variable (beta-coefficient -0.08; 95% CI -0.33, 0.17). Furthermore, no
prospective association between the 2017 IDH definition at baseline
and incident CAC >0 at either visit 2 or 3 was found in adjusted models (relative risk ratio 0.91; 95% CI 0.63, 1.31; P = 0.16).

Incident systolic or treated hypertension
Excluding the subgroup of participants taking anti-hypertensive medication at baseline and using the ESC definition, IDH was associated
with incident development of systolic hypertension or antihypertensive drug treatment [hazard ratio (HR) 3.76; 95% CI 2.38,
5.94; P < 0.001 in Model 2]. This association remained significant even
after adjustment for visit 1 systolic BP in Model 3 (Table 3). Although
similar findings were seen using the ACC/AHA 2017 definition (HR
1.71; 95% CI 1.45, 2.03; P < 0.001 in Model 2) they were no longer
significant when adjusted for visit 1 systolic BP.

Models as in Table 2.

Sensitivity analyses
Results using both definitions of IDH and for all outcomes tested
were similarly null when stratified by age, race/ethnicity, sex, and current anti-hypertensive medication use (Figure 3), again with the exception of the outcome of incident systolic or treated hypertension.
No interaction P-value was <0.05. Of note, although IDH by the
2017 ACC/AHA definition was associated with a lower risk of nonzero CAC in those on baseline hypertension treatment using the
crude model (odds ratio 0.55; 95% CI 0.35, 0.86; P = 0.008), this did
not persist in the adjusted models. We also found no statistically significant association of IDH by the 2017 ACC/AHA definition with
CVD (HR 1.21; 95% CI 0.77,1.92) or with death (HR 0.72; 95% CI
0.46, 1.12) in the sensitivity analysis that included statin and antihypertensive medications as time-varying covariables in Model 3.
Finally, in post hoc sensitivity analyses testing the additional outcomes
of chronic kidney disease, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation, IDH was
also not associated with significant excesses in risk (Table 4).

Meta-analysis of the association between
isolated diastolic hypertension and
incident cardiovascular disease
Because MESA may have been underpowered to completely rule out
an association between IDH by the 2017 ACC/AHA definition and
incident CVD events, we conducted a meta-analysis pooling our
results from MESA with those from the seven other cohorts that

have previously tested this association after adjustment for potential
confounders (Figure 4 and Graphical abstract). This meta-analysis is
stratified in that it is reported both with and without inclusion of two
large cohorts that used BP measurements obtained during routine
clinical practice (with the other six studies using BP measurements
from standardized research protocols). In this stratified metaanalysis, the 2017 IDH definition was also not consistently associated
with CVD and the magnitude of any potential relative association
was also noted to be numerically small [e.g. depending on metaanalysis inclusion criteria, the adjusted HR ranged from 1.04 (95% CI
0.98-1.10) to 1.09 (95% 1.03-1.15)].

Discussion
This analysis of an ethnically diverse and contemporary US cohort
found that IDH was associated with incident development of systolic
or treated hypertension, both when the ESC and 2017 ACC/AHA
definitions were used. However, the lack of any statistically significant
association between IDH by the 2017 ACC/AHA definition and either subclinical CVD in the form of CAC or clinical CVD in MESA is
noteworthy. These findings are consequential because, if applied, the
new 2017 ACC/AHA definition results in an estimated 5% increase in
the number of adults eligible to be diagnosed with hypertension
based on the presence of IDH alone (in America this translates into
12 million adults).6 Because our CVD event results from MESA
may have been underpowered, we also conducted a meta-analysis of
IDH defined by the 2017 ACC/AHA criteria and found either (i) no
excess in adjusted risk for CVD in collated cohorts using researchgrade BP measures; or (ii) a numerically small excess in relative risk
(i.e. HR 1.09) when all cohorts were combined (i.e. including cohorts
with less reliable measures of BP). Taken together, our data question
whether middle-aged or older adults with IDH by the 2017 ACC/
AHA definition need to be labelled as hypertensive or considered for
drug therapy.
For the most part, adequately powered studies testing the association between IDH by the ESC definition and CVD events have demonstrated increased risk among these adults who have wellcontrolled systolic BP but diastolic BP >_90 mmHg.16,21 In contrast,
most of the previous studies testing the association between IDH by
the 2017 ACC/AHA definition and CVD events have been null.
However, these latter null studies have been hampered by concerns
for inadequate statistical power (both because IDH by this definition
is relatively uncommon and because approximately half the adults
newly diagnosed with IDH by the 2017 ACC/AHA definition are
younger than 45 years6 and are, consequently, less likely to develop
events). The current analysis aimed to address this power concern.
First, the use of MESA data allows an investigation into the association
between IDH and subclinical CVD, as defined by CAC. Because CAC
is a continuous outcome and not a binary one, linear regression analyses have improved power to test for any association with IDH.
While there was a trend for increased CAC among persons with
IDH by the ESC definition, the statistically conclusive lack of association between the 2017 ACC/AHA definition of IDH and increased
CAC, either in cross-section or prospectively, provides further evidence that IDH, when defined by the 2017 ACC/AHA criteria, does
not appear to be associated with excess CVD risk.6 Second, we

pooled MESA event data with those from published cohorts in a
meta-analysis and found a persistent lack of consistent association between IDH by the 2017 ACC/AHA definition and CVD events.
The few individual studies to date that do suggest an association
between IDH by the 2017 ACC/AHA definition and CVD outcomes
used data from administrative datasets where BP values were taken
from a range of clinical settings and measured and recorded under
normal practice conditions.15,18-20 However, it is known that diastolic BP can be challenging to measure accurately on a consistent basis
in usual clinical care.22 We believe that the current MESA data, as
well as the stratified meta-analysis reported above, showing no statistically significant adjusted association of IDH with CVD events among
the cohorts of middle-aged to older adults who had BP measured
using rigorous research methodologies, are more likely to be valid.

However, we cannot conclude from this analysis that the 2017
ACC/AHA definition of IDH is completely benign. Specifically, and as
it has also been previously described for IDH by the traditional (and
current ESC) definition,26 the present analysis from MESA does demonstrate that the 2017 ACC/AHA definition of IDH identifies adults
at risk for future systolic hypertension. Therefore, while our study
does not support the initiation of anti-hypertensive therapies for
middle-aged to older adults with baseline IDH, it nonetheless highlights the importance of serially evaluating these patients for the development of systolic hypertension over time, with continued
emphasis on lifestyle improvements. Furthermore, our results may
not apply to young adults. Indeed, the only report to date testing the
association between the 2017 ACC/AHA definition of IDH and CVD
events among young adults specifically suggests that there may be

risk among Korean adults younger than those included in our current
study.18,30 This Korean study comprised of data from a large insurance database, which used routine clinical measures of BP. Therefore,
additional research from rigorous cohorts of young adults with
research-grade BP measurement will be necessary to probe the possible age interaction further. Furthermore, the possibility of an interaction based on different ethnicities warrants future study.

Limitations
First, as an observational study, residual confounding cannot be
excluded. Second, the meta-analysis stratum that included registry
data comprising of routine clinical BP measurements suggested a
small though statistically significant association between IDH by the
2017 ACC/AHA definition and CVD. However, heterogeneity was
introduced (I2 statistic = 61%) to the meta-analysis when these

registry data were added to the cohorts with more rigorous measurement of BP and, even if these less reliable estimates are valid, the
relative increase in risk of just 9% is numerically small (noting also
that there was a low absolute risk for CVD among persons with normotension and IDH, both in the previously reported studies and in
MESA). Third, the minimum participant age in MESA was 45 at baseline and our meta-analysis contained few participants below 50 years;
therefore, as mentioned above, the results presented here may not
be generalizable to younger adults.18,30 Fourth, we included persons
with and without anti-hypertensive therapy in our analyses, though
BP guideline targets pertain to both initiation and titration of therapy.
Results stratifying participants with and without baseline use of antihypertensive therapies were concordant. Fifth, variation between
studies in the BP measurement method (i.e. manual vs. automatic
oscillometric) might partially influence analyses of IDH. Specifically,

these subgroup analyses, the model did not include the variable to which the sample was sub-grouped (e.g. the analyses of race/ethnicity subgroups

direct measurement of diastolic BP is only possible with intra-arterial
assessment and the mechanism of indirect measurement used by
manual vs. oscillometric devices differs slightly for diastolic BP (manual being based on human auscultation and automatic-oscillometric
devices being based on algorithms that detect vibrations in the arterial wall). Prior data indicate that the automatic BP device used in
MESA may underestimate diastolic BP (compared with mercury
sphygmomanometry) by up to 3 mmHg.28 Sixth, the power in MESA
to test associations between IDH and CVD events was low, though
our results are augmented by a well-powered meta-analysis. Seventh,
we were unable to include one report15 in our meta-analysis because
it modelled the 2017 ACC/AHA definition of IDH using diastolic BP
as a Z-score continuous exposure rather than a categorical exposure. Finally, we included the most fully adjusted HRs available in each
cohort for our meta-analysis, but we note there was heterogeneity in
the number and type of variables adjusted for and that meta-analyses
of cohort studies are challenging and should be considered hypothesis generating.

Conclusion
There are no randomized trials proving that diastolic BP should be
treated to below 90 mmHg and the preponderance of observational
