Aims

Physical frailty is a commonly encountered geriatric syndrome among older adults without coronary heart disease
(CHD). The impact of frailty on the incidence of long-term cardiovascular outcomes is not known.We aimed to
evaluate the long-term association of frailty, measured by the Fried frailty phenotype, with all-cause-mortality and
MACE among older adults without a history of CHD at baseline in the National Health and Aging Trends Study.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods and
We used the National Health and Aging Trends Study, a prospective cohort study linked to a Medicare sample.
Results
Participants with a prior history of CHD were excluded. Frailty was measured during the baseline visit using the

Fried physical frailty phenotype. Cardiovascular outcomes were assessed during a 6-year follow-up.
Of the 4656 study participants, 3259 (70%) had no history of CHD 1 year prior to their baseline visit. Compared
to those without frailty, subjects with frailty were older (mean age 82.1 vs. 75.1 years, P < 0.001), more likely to be
female (68.3% vs. 54.9%, P < 0.001), and belong to an ethnic minority. The prevalence of hypertension, falls, disability, anxiety/depression, and multimorbidity was much higher in the frail and pre-frail than the non-frail participants.
In a Cox time-to-event multivariable model and during 6-year follow-up, the incidences of death and of each individual cardiovascular outcomes were all significantly higher in the frail than in the non-frail patients including major
adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) [hazard ratio (HR) 1.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.53, 2.06], death (HR
2.70, 95% CI 2.16, 3.38), acute myocardial infarction (HR 1.95, 95% CI 1.31, 2.90), stroke (HR 1.71, 95% CI 1.34,
2.17), peripheral vascular disease (HR 1.80, 95% CI 1.44, 2.27), and coronary artery disease (HR 1.35, 95% CI 1.11,
1.65).

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
In patients without CHD, frailty is a risk factor for the development of MACEs. Efforts to identify frailty in patients
without CHD and interventions to limit or reverse frailty status are needed and, if successful, may limit subsequent
adverse cardiovascular events.

Introduction
One challenge in the clinical management of the rapidly expanding
older adult population in the USA is the increased prevalence of
frailty, an important geriatric syndrome.1 This is particularly relevant
in the cardiovascular sphere as the prevalence and incidence of cardiovascular disease are also markedly increased with age. The physical frailty phenotype is a clinical state in which there is increased
vulnerability to stressors due to diminished reserves across multiple
physiological systems, resulting in functional decline, increased mortality, and a higher likelihood of complications from disease and from
therapeutic interventions.1,2
In prior studies that examined the influence of frailty on cardiovascular outcomes, the assessment of frailty was performed in study
populations at high cardiovascular risk, including those with acute
coronary syndromes, peripheral vascular disease, and valvular heart
disease.3-6 For example, Farooqi et al.7 have shown that frailty can
provide an incremental prognostic value in addition to traditional

..
.. cardiovascular risk assessment, but this meta-analysis included a mix
.. of studies with and without cardiovascular disease. However, among
..
.. patients without known coronary heart disease (CHD), the long.. term association between frailty and major adverse cardiovascular
..
.. events (MACE) remains largely unknown. In this study, we aimed to
.. evaluate the long-term association of frailty, measured by the Fried
... frailty phenotype, with all-cause-mortality and MACE among older
..
.. adults without a history of CHD using the National Health and Aging
.. Trends Study (NHATS).

Frailty assessment
Frailty in each older patient in the NHATS-CMS study was assessed using
the five domains of the Fried physical frailty phenotype9: exhaustion, low
physical activity, weakness, slowness, and shrinking (i.e. unintentional
weight loss). If three or more, out of the five criteria, were present, the individual was categorized as frail and those with one or two of the five
were categorized as 'pre-frail'. Out of the total study population
(n = 3259), 16% (n = 527) were categorized as 'frail' and 47% (n = 1535)
were categorized as 'non-frail'. Detailed definitions of meeting each criterion were previously published.10 For missing frailty data, a multiple imputation methods was adapted, and it was similar to previously published
work that used the imputed frailty dataset out of 10 replicas.10 The estimates from running separate models on the 10 replicates were pooled
together to obtain the final estimates. The pooling of the estimates was
performed in such a way that appropriately accounted for the uncertainty
in the missing frailty data imputation (see Statistical analysis section).11

Cardiovascular outcomes
A MACE was defined as death from any cause, acute myocardial infarction, any subsequent CHD, stroke, or peripheral vascular disease, whichever came first. To address competing risks of death, MACE2 was defined
as acute myocardial infarction, any subsequent CHD, stroke, or peripheral vascular disease, whichever came first, excluding all-cause mortality.
Secondary cardiovascular endpoints included each of these individual
components identified in the Center of Medicare and Medicaid Services
database during the 6-year follow-up. Furthermore, any primary hospital
admission for subsequent CHD was identified and reported separately.

Geriatric risks
For each patient, specific geriatric risks were assessed during the NHATS
follow-up visits. These included measures of functioning [ADL and instrumental ADL (IADL), and functional limitations], cognitive function (any
form of cognitive impairment, dementia/Alzheimer's disease), disability,
and mobility disability. For each older participant, the Katz scale was performed to assess independence in (i) self-care (ADL: bathing, dressing,
eating, toileting); (ii) household activities (IADL: doing laundry, preparing
meals, shopping for groceries and for personal items, medication management, handling bills and banking); and (iii) mobility (getting around inside,
going outside, getting out of bed).10 Screening for cognitive dysfunction
was performed to assess functions related to memory, orientation, and
executive function. For patients with severe cognitive impairment, a

..
.. proxy interview was conducted, and the proxy was asked about the func.. tion of the participant. Dementia status was ascertained using the follow.. ing instruments: (i) a physician report indicating that the participant has
..
.. dementia or Alzheimer's disease; (ii) a scoring indicating a probable de.. mentia administered to proxies; and (iii) results from cognitive tests that
.. evaluate memory, orientation, and executive function.12 Disability was
..
.. measured using the American Community Survey Disability Questions.
.. Outcomes related to mobility, self-care, and household activities were
..
.. performed independently for each participant during follow-up visits.
.. Loss of independence was defined as patients reporting never or rarely
.. going outside or the use of devices to go outside.
..
..
..
.. Demographic characteristics, medical
..
.. conditions, and healthcare utilization
.. Each older adult enrolled in the study was asked whether their physician
..
.. had ever told them they had any of the following medical conditions: high
.. blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, stroke, any cardiac disorder, arthritis,
..
.. lung or bone disease, and cognitive impairment or dementia.
.. Hospitalization within the past 12 months and baseline assessment on
.. self-care, mobility, and household activities were collected.10
..
..
..
.. Statistical analysis
..
.. Participants with a history of CHD and stroke were excluded. During the
.. 2011 baseline NHATS visit, participants were categorized into three dis.. tinct groups: no frailty, pre-frailty, and frailty as assessed by the Fried phys..
.. ical frailty phenotype. Demographics, smoking status, comorbidity,
.. hospitalizations, emergency department visits, falls, self-care, mobility,
..
.. household activities, depression, anxiety, and cognitive impairment at
.. baseline were reported for the frail and the non-frail. Frequencies and
.. percentages were calculated for categorical variables and mean +/- stand..
.. ard deviation for continuous variables. Data on self-care, mobility, and
.. household activities are presented as cumulative proportions at 6 years
.. for the frail vs. the non-frail group (Table 1).
..
..
Proportional hazard models were used to assess the association be.. tween frailty and cardiovascular outcomes among older adults at 6-year
..
.. follow-up. Patients were censored if they developed the cardiovascular
.. outcomes of interest or if they were lost to follow-up. To address con..
.. founding by age, demographics, and other risk factors, we performed
.. three additional multivariable Cox models. Model 2 adjusted for age and
.. sex; Model 3 adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, body mass index (BMI),
..
.. and smoking status; and Model 4 adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, BMI,
.. smoking status, diabetes, hypertension, number of comorbid diseases,
..
.. and dependency status (as a surrogate measure for composite functional
.. status). To explore sensitivity of findings to dementia status, we per.. formed a sensitivity analysis by excluding those with probable or definitive
..
.. dementia (Supplementary material online, Tables S1). The assumption for
.. Cox proportional hazard models was checked by plotting the Schoenfeld
..
.. residuals against survival time for each primary and secondary cardiovas.. cular outcome by frailty group. As sensitivity analysis, we fitted stratified
.. Cox models that allowed the form of the underlying baseline hazard func..
.. tion to vary across age categories and between sexes (i.e. violation of the
.. proportion hazard assumption) (see Supplementary material online,
..
.. Tables S2 and S3). Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed to evaluate the
.. association of frailty status at baseline with MACE and each individual car.. diovascular outcome. Log-rank statistic was calculated for each curve. To
..
.. test for interaction between frailty, as categorical variable, with each indi.. vidual cardiovascular risk factors, likelihood ratio tests were performed
.. to compare models with and without the interaction term. We have
..
. tested interactions of frailty with cardiovascular disease risk factors (i.e.

65 years and older, a nationally representative cohort of older patients in
the community. These older adults were interviewed in 2011 during their
baseline visit and annual re-interviews were performed for each participant to document changes, trends, and dynamics in later life functioning.8
Detailed information on geriatric risks, including frailty, physical and cognitive capacity, activities of daily living (ADL), and the social, physical, and
technological environments were collected. African Americans and
patients from older ages were oversampled from the Medicare enrolment file. For each participant, the NHATS repository is linked to
Medicare data that were available prior to the 2011 baseline visit.
The study population included adults >_65 years of age enrolled during
the 2011 NHATS baseline visit who also had linked Medicare data available for analysis prior to their baseline visit. For each participant, CHD
was identified 12 months prior to the 2011 NHATS baseline visit using

BMI, smoking, diabetes, and hypertension) in Model 4 with each individual
MACE outcome (Supplementary material online, Tables S4-S7). To facilitate interpretation, the hazard ratios of frailty and pre-frailty were presented separately by the level of each significant modifier in the
supplementary material. For missing data on frailty, we adopted a twostep approach. First, if a test (grip or walking test) was not done because
of health/safety concerns, a value of zero was assigned to indicate worst
performance. Second, for remaining missing values, we employed multiple imputation (10 replicates) using chained equations (see details in
Bandeen-Roche et al.10). A separate model was fitted using each imputed
dataset, and the parameter estimates (i.e. regression coefficients and
standard errors) obtained from each model were then combined into
one set of inferential statistics via the STATA 'mi estimate' command that
accounted for the uncertainty in the imputed values.
All tests are two-sided, and the statistically significant level is set at
P < 0.05. Data analyses were conducted using SAS (v.9.4; SAS Institute
Inc, Cary, NC, USA) and STATA version 15 MP (Stata Corp., College
Station, TX, USA). The Johns Hopkins Medicine Institutional Review
Board approved this study.

>_75 years of age. Female participants constituted 61% of the cohort
and the majority enrolled was non-Hispanic Whites. On average, the
majority was overweight, and more than half of the cohort smoked
at least one cigarette per day. The majority of this older population
had multiple chronic conditions and 15% of the cohort had four or
more chronic comorbidities. The most prevalent medical conditions
were hypertension, arthritis, and osteoporosis. Approximately 21%
of the study population was living with diabetes mellitus, and 6.1%
had dementia at baseline.
Of the 3259 patients who had no history of CHD or stroke prior
to their baseline NHATS visits, 1535 (47%) patients were pre-frail
and 527 (16%) patients had physical frailty according to the Fried
frailty phenotype. Of the total study population, 478 (15%) had missing frailty data at baseline and these estimates were imputed (see
Methods section). Patients who were frail were older, more likely to
be women and belong to an ethnic minority as compared to non-frail
patients. Frail patients had higher prevalence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, history of prior cardiovascular risk factors, dementia,
lung disease, and arthritis than non-frail patients. The overall number
of chronic comorbid conditions was also higher among frail patients
with approximately one in three patients reported having four or
more chronic medical conditions (Table 1). Frail patients were more
likely to be admitted to the hospital and had more emergency

department visits in 12 months prior to their baseline NHATS visits,
than did non-frail patients. When evaluating measures of disability at
baseline, including self-care, mobility disability, and household activities disability, patients with frailty were more likely to report significant impairment, than did non-frail patients. The overall disability
level (i.e. having difficulties requiring help) among the frail group was
as high as 76.8%, but only 10.0% reported having difficulties requiring
help in the non-frail group. Frail patients also had high cognitive impairment at baseline and 40% had probable dementia at baseline
(Table 1).
The age-adjusted incidence of cardiovascular outcomes at the 6year follow-up is presented in Table 2. Frail patients developed more
cardiovascular outcomes than did the pre-frail and non-frail groups
over the 6-year follow-up, including a MACE, death, acute myocardial
infarction, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, or any coronary artery
disease (Figure 1). In an unadjusted Cox proportional hazards model,
frailty and pre-frailty were associated with MACE and with each individual component of cardiovascular outcomes: all-cause death, acute
myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular disease, and any subsequent coronary artery disease, as compared to non-frail patients.
After adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, census division, residence
and income, BMI, traditional cardiovascular risk factors, dependency,
and the number of concomitant chronic medical conditions, frailty
remains highly associated with MACE, death, and peripheral vascular
disease at the 6-year follow-up in the NHATS study (Table 3). In a
sensitivity analysis excluding those patients with definitive or probable dementia (n = 2832), both frailty and pre-frailty were associated
with MACE and with each individual cardiovascular outcome during
follow-up when compared to the non-frail group (Supplementary
material online, Table S1). In a stratified Cox model that allowed the
form of the underlying baseline hazard function to vary across age
categories and between sexes, the results largely remained the same

(Supplementary material online, Tables S2 and S3). Modified association of frail by smoking status on all-cause mortality, acute myocardial infarction, and coronary artery disease as outcomes are
presented in Supplementary material online, Tables S4 -S6 and that
of frailty on peripheral vascular disease by hypertension is presented
in Supplementary material online, Table S7.

Discussion
We examined the association of physical frailty phenotype with cardiovascular outcomes among older adults in the NHATS without
prior CHD during the 6-year follow-up. The major findings of this
study are as follows: (i) participants without CHD at baseline who exhibit pre-frailty or physical frailty, as measured by the Fried frailty
phenotype, had a high prevalence of multiple chronic conditions,
baseline disability, mobility disability, and cognitive dysfunction as
compared to non-frail CHD participants; (ii) participants with baseline pre-frailty and physical frailty also had higher rates of healthcare
utilization with more emergency department visits, admissions to the
inpatient service, and longer hospital lengths of stay; and (iii) as compared to non-frail subjects, pre-frail and frail older patients had a
higher risk of developing MACE, including mortality during the 6-year
follow-up, even after adjusting for demographic characteristics, traditional cardiovascular risk factors, and multimorbidity at baseline
(Graphical abstract).
In this cohort of older adults free of CHD at baseline, we estimated that the prevalence of frailty is 16%, which is significantly
lower than the prevalence of frailty among patients with preexisting
cardiovascular disease.13,14 Consistent with our estimates, pooled
analysis from 46 studies that enrolled participants with frailty showed
that 1 in 6 community-dwelling older adults lives with frailty.15 While
the older patients in our study were free of known cardiac disease at
baseline, many older adults with frailty frequently have coexisting cardiovascular risk factors. A bidirectional association between frailty
and multimorbidity exists, in which the coexistence of these two geriatric syndromes will lead to the progressive worsening of both.16 In a
systematic review and meta-analysis of 48 observational studies, 70%
of frail older adults examined also had multimorbidity with two or
more coexisting conditions.16 In our study, 60% of older patients
reported multimorbidity, defined as two or more coexisting chronic
medical conditions. Hypertension was the most commonly encountered cardiovascular risk factor and 1 in 5 patients had diabetes mellitus. The burden of these cardiovascular risk factors is clearly higher in
the frail, than the non-frailty cohort. Vetrano et al.16 reported the important observation that the vast majority of older adults with frailty
are also multimorbid, but very few older adults with multimorbidity
are also frail. The authors hypothesize that multimorbidity plays an
important deterministic role in the development of frailty syndrome.
Frailty and multimorbidity, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus,
and other traditional cardiovascular risk factors, can potentially share
common pathophysiology mechanisms that put older adults at risk
for the development of cardiovascular disease including, inflammation, coagulopathy, and metabolic dysregulation.17
In a retrospective cohort study, middle aged participants from the
Civil Service departments in London were examined based on their
cardiovascular risk at baseline.18 Those with four different

mentioned previously. In a cross-sectional study, Fernandes et al.20
investigated the association between frailty, measured by the physical
frailty phenotype, and cardiovascular risk measured by the
Framingham risk score. The investigators found that frailty and prefrailty were associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Frailty and
cardiovascular disease risk were measured at the same time.
Veronese et al.21 evaluated the prognostic value of a multidimensional prognostic index, an instrument grounded in comprehensive geriatric assessment, and self-reported cardiovascular outcomes over 8
years of follow-up. The multidimensional index predicted the onset
of cardiovascular disease in community dwellers affected by, or at
risk for, osteoarthritis. Our study complements these findings by
measuring frailty and pre-frailty, using the Fried physical frailty phenotype, and incidences of the outcomes were ascertained in the CMS
database during 6 years of follow-up. The cumulative knowledge continues to highlight the importance of frailty as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and trigger the need for integration of frailty
assessment in the cardiovascular profile of older adults.22,23 Similar to
our findings, Marinus et al.24 reported a higher prevalence of frailty in

older female than male participants. This propensity to frailty in older
female patients may have differential power of prediction when compared to older patients at risk for cardiovascular disease. Newman
and colleagues examined participants enrolled in the Cardiovascular
Health Study and reported that the physical frailty phenotype at baseline was strongly associated with imaging markers of subclinical atherosclerosis including carotid stenosis, impaired ankle-brachial index,
and other electro- and echocardiographic variables.25 Progression of
these subclinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular conditions to
overt clinical events is likely driven by the pathophysiologic
mechanisms present in frail older adults including higher oxidative
stress26; elevated circulating inflammatory biomarkers including
C-reactive protein, and neutrophils, white cell counts, and
interleukin-6, and measures of coagulopathy, including D-dimer and
fibrinogen.27-32 Prior research has shown that even among patients
who meet only one or two of the Fried criteria, also referred to as
'pre-frail', there is a higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease
after adjustment for traditional risk factors, inflammatory markers,
and glycated haemoglobin during a follow-up period of 4.4 years.33 In

Conclusion
In the NHATS study, we found that pre-frailty and physical frailty
phenotype are associated with a significant risk for mortality and the
development of MACE during 6 years of follow-up, even after controlling for traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Efforts to integrate
frailty assessment as part of primary cardiovascular prevention programs in older adults at risk for cardiovascular disease are essential in
daily clinical cardiovascular practice. Testing the efficacy and safety of
physical activity programs, nutritional interventions, and cognitive
training to prevent or reverse physical frailty in patients at risk for the
development of cardiovascular disease is needed as the US older
adult population expands rapidly in the coming decades.

the NHATS study, we adjusted for baseline demographic variables,
BMI, multimorbidity, and other traditional risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Over 6 years of follow-up in the NHATS study, we
found that older patients with pre-frailty and frailty exhibit higher incidences of all-cause mortality and MACE, as a composite mainly
driven by death, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease. In a metaanalysis that included cross-sectional and prospective cohort studies,
Veronese and colleagues23 reported that frailty was associated with
an approximate three-fold increased risk of cardiovascular disease
when compared to robust patients. To complement these findings,
our study population enables the evaluation of frailty in older adults
as predictor of MACE in patients with or without previous cardiovascular disease. Efforts to study geriatric syndromes during acute cardiovascular illnesses are well recognized by the cardiovascular
community at large,2,34 but the ability to integrate the assessment of
frailty in the care for older patients at risk for cardiovascular disease
is limited because of the lack of efficacious therapies to prevent or reverse the development of physical frailty. However, several initiatives
are underway to test the influence of physical activity programs, nutritional interventions, cognitive training, and a combination of these
to prevent or reverse frailty in older adults.35 Because cardiovascular
disease remains the most common cause of mortality in older adults,
efforts to establish the efficacy and safety of such interventions in cardiovascular practice, similar to other therapies targeting traditional
cardiovascular risk factors, are needed. The 2020 ESC Guidelines for
the management of acute coronary syndromes in patients presenting
without persistent ST-segment elevation acknowledged the importance of integrating frailty in the management and balancing the risks
of each individual treatment (i.e. medical therapy plus invasive strategy) against the risk of harm from not offering therapy given perceived risk of complications.36 Our work underscores the urgent
need to establish robust clinical trial data to inform management for
older patients with frailty at risk for cardiovascular disease.
This study has potential limitations. First, MACEs were diagnosed
using data obtained from the Medicare claims database from hospital
and outpatient encounters after the 2011 baseline NHATS visit.
While this method of studying cardiovascular outcomes is widely
used in health services research, the severity and degree of acute
myocardial infarction, stroke, vascular disease, and cardiac-specific
mortality could not be ascertained. Despite this limitation, this large
study is novel because it is the first to evaluate the temporal relationship between frailty and incident cardiovascular disease during 6 years
of follow-up among patients without a history of CHD in the
Medicare database. Second, it is plausible that patients with frailty
have undiagnosed cardiovascular disease, which in turn led to a higher
incidence of cardiovascular events during follow-up. Third, physical
frailty was measured at the baseline visit as a binary variable with impairment of three or more domains in the Fried criteria. However,
frailty can be a reversible and dynamic physiologic process and may
change over time.37 When evaluating the association between physical frailty and cardiovascular outcomes, significant confounding
exists, and caution is needed when interpreting the unadjusted estimates presented in Table 3. To provide a comprehensive assessment
of the influence of frailty on cardiovascular outcomes, a multivariable
Cox regression model, stratified by Cox modelling techniques conditioning on age, and other sensitivity analyses were provided to mitigate the influence of confounding by indication.
