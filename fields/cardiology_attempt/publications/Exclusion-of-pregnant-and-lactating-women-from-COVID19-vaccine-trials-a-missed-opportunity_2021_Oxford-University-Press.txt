from COVID-19 vaccine trials: a missed

In the midst of a devastating pandemic with high transmissibility and
case fatality, the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine trials represent hope of an
end to the global burden of COVID-19 infection, hospital utilization,
and death. The efficacy and safety of the vaccines have been demonstrated in adults across a range of demographics, with the exception of
those who are pregnant and lactating. This systematic exclusion-
common in clinical trials-represents a missed opportunity to protect
a group at risk of adverse outcomes in the setting of COVID-19 infection. It has special implications on the healthcare workforce, a majority
of whom are women and at high risk of COVID-19 infection.
The exclusion of pregnant and lactating women from COVID-19
vaccine trials (Text Box 1) reflects a historic pattern of 'protection by
exclusion', representing an instance in which the estimated effect of a
therapy on mother and child will rely on anecdotal and delayed reports
from healthcare settings rather than the monitored setting of a clinical
trial.2 This exclusion is not justified. For example, Pfizer and Moderna
excluded pregnant and lactating women from their mRNA COVID-19
vaccine trials3,4 with no biological evidence to suggest that the vaccines
are teratogenic, and no plausibility that they are transmitted in breast
milk. The mRNA vaccines rapidly degenerate after injection in muscle
cells, and aside from the post-vaccination immune response that can
cause a fever, there is no reason to assume, a priori, that harm will
come to pregnant and lactating women enrolled in the trials.4
The exclusion of pregnant and lactating women from the COVID19 vaccine trials has implications on healthcare workers, who are
among the highest risk groups for COVID-19 exposure and infection.
As many as three out of four healthcare workers and four out of five
nurses are women, and it is estimated that more than 300 000 health

care workers in the USA alone are pregnant or immediately postpartum during vaccine implementing.5 The dual risk posed by COVID-19
to pregnant healthcare professionals-increased workplace exposure
and increased risk of adverse outcomes if infected6-makes it particularly concerning that the trials failed to include pregnant or lactating
individuals. Furthermore, when healthcare workers are infected, they
become sources of nosocomial spread thereby posing a risk to
patients and to other healthcare workers.
The recommendations for use of the COVID-19 Pfizer and
Moderna vaccine in pregnant and lactating women now range from
avoidance of the vaccine-as recommended by the World Health
Organization and some regulatory agencies-to reliance on recipients
to make choices guided by their values or their clinicians' judgement.5,7-9 Some regulatory bodies recommend against pregnancy in
the weeks following the vaccine. The rationale for the recommendations of vaccine avoidance in pregnancy, pregnancy avoidance in weeks
following vaccination, and decision-making regarding vaccination safety
by clinicians in absence of clinical trial data is unclear.
Pregnancy and lactation are two distinct biological states that are
often conflated in the eligibility criteria of clinical trials. Drugs that
may have evidence of teratogenicity in biological studies may not be
secreted in breast milk, and drugs secreted in breast milk with harmful effects to baby may not be teratogenic. The grouping of pregnancy and lactation into a single condition that is systematically
excluded from clinical trials is often ill-conceived.2 Indeed, the exclusions of one or both groups of patients from clinical trials is often
without justification. For example, pregnant and lactating women
were excluded from the COVID-19 hydroxychloroquine and

azithromycin trials when these drugs have been used to treat pneumonia, malaria, and lupus in pregnant women and lactating women
for several years.
The systematic exclusion of pregnant and lactating women from
clinical trials, while broadly accepted, does not uphold the ethical principles of justice, beneficence, and autonomy (Figure 1). Results from trials in non-pregnant populations cannot be safely extrapolated to
pregnant women due to differences in physiology that influence the
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs. Recommendations
for most therapies come with the stipulation that there is no safety or
efficacy data to support their use in pregnant or lactating women.2 The
treatment of many conditions during pregnancy or lactation relies on
historic drugs for which there is only observational data to confirm
safety. This applies to all cardiovascular conditions in pregnant and lactating women; the level of evidence to support treatment recommendations in these women in major guideline documents is almost

exclusively 'C', based on small studies, observational data, or the consensus of experts.9 Pregnant and lactating women are thus deprived
from the benefit of modern-day therapies that improve outcomes in
other groups. Furthermore, trials that exclude pregnant and lactating
women often also exclude those who can potentially become pregnant, and these criteria are independently associated with the underenrolment of women in clinical trials.2,11
To ensure that safe vaccines and treatments are extended to all
groups during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important that exclusion
criteria be considered carefully, keeping in mind those at risk of exposure, infection, and adverse outcomes. Exclusion criteria should be justified based on data from biological studies, trials in non-human
primates, and in the case of drugs historically used for other indications, observational safety data. Clinical trialists and pharmaceutical
companies can include maternal-fetal medicine specialists on their
steering committees to obtain guidance and manage risk during the

trial. As pregnancy and lactation are different biological conditions,
they should not be combined into a single exclusion criterion in clinical
trials.
The appropriateness of having regulators and clinicians make recommendations to pregnant and lactating women about a potentially
life-saving vaccine in absence of high-quality evidence merit consideration. While the exclusion of pregnant and lactating women has become the norm in clinical trials across medical conditions, the stakes in
doing so are perhaps the greatest during a pandemic that has taken an
immeasurabletoll on healthcare professionals, the majority of whom
are women. The categorical exclusion of pregnant and lactating
women in COVID-19 trials to date represents a missed opportunity to
inform the care of a demographic group that is often subjected to disparities in care.
