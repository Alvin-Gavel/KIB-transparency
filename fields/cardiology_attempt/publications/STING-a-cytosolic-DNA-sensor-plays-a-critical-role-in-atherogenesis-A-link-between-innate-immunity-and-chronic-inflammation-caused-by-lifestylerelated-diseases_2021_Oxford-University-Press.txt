Aims

Lifestyle-related diseases promote atherosclerosis, a chronic inflammatory disease; however, the molecular mechanism remains largely unknown. Endogenous DNA fragments released under over-nutrient condition provoke
sterile inflammation through the recognition by DNA sensors. Here, we investigated the role of stimulator of interferon genes (STING), a cytosolic DNA sensor, in atherogenesis.

Methods
Apolipoprotein E-deficient (Apoe/) mice fed a western-type diet (WTD), a hypercholesterolaemic mouse model,
showed higher STING expression and markers for DNA damage such as cH2AX, p53, and single-stranded DNA

(ssDNA) accumulation in macrophages in the aorta compared with wild-type (WT) mice. The level of cGAMP, a
STING agonist, in the aorta was higher in Apoe/ mice. Genetic deletion of Sting in Apoe/ mice reduced atherosclerotic lesions in the aortic arch, lipid, and macrophage accumulation in plaques, and inflammatory molecule expression in the aorta compared with the control. Pharmacological blockade of STING using a specific inhibitor, C176, ameliorated atherogenesis in Apoe/ mice. In contrast, bone marrow-specific STING expression in Apoe/
mice stimulated atherogenesis. Expression or deletion of STING did not affect metabolic parameters and blood
pressure. In vitro studies revealed that STING activation by cGAMP or mitochondrial DNA accelerated inflammatory molecule expression (e.g. TNF-a or IFN-b) in mouse and human macrophages. Activation of nuclear factor-jB
and TANK binding kinase 1 was involved in STING-associated vascular inflammation and macrophage activation.
Furthermore, human atherosclerotic lesions in the carotid arteries expressed STING and cGAMP.

Conclusion

Stimulator of interferon genes stimulates pro-inflammatory activation of macrophages, leading to the development
of atherosclerosis. Stimulator of interferon genes signalling may serve as a potential therapeutic target for
atherosclerosis.

Translational perspective
Lifestyle-related diseases cause vascular inflammation and subsequent atherosclerosis; however, underlying mechanisms remain largely
unknown. Accumulating evidence suggested that endogenous DNA fragments released under over-nutrient condition provoke sterile
inflammation. Here, we demonstrate a pivotal role of stimulator of interferon genes (STING), a cytosolic DNA sensor, in atherogenesis.
In hypercholesterolaemic mice, DNA damage and cGAMP, a direct STING agonist, increased in the aorta. Genetic deletion or pharmacological blockade of STING ameliorated atherogenesis. Stimulator of interferon genes activation promoted inflammatory molecule expression in human and mouse macrophages. Furthermore, human atherosclerotic lesions also expressed STING and cGAMP.
Stimulator of interferon genes signalling, which links lifestyle-related diseases to chronic inflammatory disease, may provide a novel
mechanism of atherogenesis and serve as a potential therapeutic target for atherosclerosis.

Introduction
Chronic inflammation in the vasculature causes atherosclerosis1;
however, underlying molecular mechanisms remain not fully understood. Recent advances in immunology have dissected molecular
pathways involved in the innate immune system that induce and promote inflammatory responses in the vascular wall.2 Pattern recognition receptors (PPRs) such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) on immune

cells including macrophages contribute to self-defence by activation
of inflammation against molecules typically associated with pathogens.3 Besides, emerging evidence has revealed that PPRs have roles
in the pathogenesis of various diseases by activating sterile inflammation in response to various endogenous ligands.4,5 Endogenous DNA
fragments released from or accumulated in host cells function as important endogenous ligands, though DNA is indispensable for life.6
Recent studies have revealed that physiological and pathological

STING signalling, originally associated with innate immune system, may provide a novel mechanism of atherogenesis by linking lifestyle-related diseases to
chronic inflammatory disease and serve as a potential therapeutic target for atherosclerosis.

Measurement of cGAMP in atherosclerotic lesions was performed by
LC-MS/MS. For further details, please refer to the Supplementary material online.

Statistical analysis
All numerical values are expressed as mean +/- SD. The Shapiro-Wilk normality test was used to assess whether variables had a normal distribution. Comparison of parameters between two groups was performed
with unpaired Student's t-test when data showed a normal distribution or
with Mann-Whitney U test when data did not show a normal distribution. For human macrophage experiments, Wilcoxon signed-rank test
was used to perform paired comparison of the expression of inflammatory molecules between non-treatment and treatment conditions, because data did not show a normal distribution. A P-value of <0.05 was
considered statistically significant.

Results
Stimulator of interferon genes
expression and DNA damage
increased in atherosclerotic aorta
First, we examined the expression of STING and cGAMP in atherosclerotic lesions in western-type diet (WTD) fed Apoe/
mice, a mouse model for hypercholesterolaemia-associated atherosclerosis. Stimulator of interferon genes expression increased
in the aorta of Apoe/ mice compared with wild-type (WT)
mice (Figure 1A and B). Stimulator of interferon genes expression
co-localized with a marker for macrophages, Mac3, in atherosclerotic plaques (Figure 1C). The aorta obtained from Apoe/ mice
showed features of DNA damage such as higher expression of
cH2AX, p53, and accumulation of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)
in macrophages (Figure 1D and E). We further examined whether
DNA damage associates with the increase in cGAMP. The results
of highly sensitive LS-MS/MS analysis clearly demonstrated that
cGAMP level in the aorta was higher in Apoe/ mice compared
with WT mice (P = 0.029, Figure 1F and G).

Genetic deletion of stimulator of
interferon genes ameliorated
atherogenesis in Apoe/ mice
To investigate the role of STING in atherogenesis, we compared atherosclerotic lesion progression in the aortic arch between Apoe/
mice and Sting/Apoe/mice after 20 weeks of WTD feeding. The
absence of STING expression in Sting/Apoe/mice was confirmed
in the aorta and leucocytes (Supplementary material online, Figure S1).
Sting/Apoe/ mice demonstrated a significant reduction in atherosclerotic lesion development in the aortic arch (P = 0.17  10-4) and
the aortic root (P = 0.017), accompanied with reduction of lipid
deposition, and macrophage accumulation as determined by Mac3 expression (P = 0.013), in atherosclerotic lesions (Figure 2A-C),
compared with Apoe/ mice. In addition, the expression of anti-inflammatory macrophage marker, CD206, was higher in Sting/

Apoe/ mice (Supplementary material online, Figure S2). Systemic

processes in lifestyle-associated diseases such as diabetes, hypercholesterolaemia, and ageing, cause degradation of cells and subsequent
damage of both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA,7-11 which results in
the release and/or accumulation of DNA fragments.12-14 This DNA
damage contributes to the initiation and progression of inflammatory
diseases including atherosclerosis.15-21
Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) was originally known as a
cytosolic DNA sensor that activates the innate immune system
against pathogens.22,23 Stimulator of interferon genes is activated by
cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), an intracellular second messenger that is
synthesized in the interaction of cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)
and cytosolic DNA fragments.24,25 Subsequently, STING activates
transcription factors, interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor-jB (NF-jB), via TANK binding kinase (TBK)1 and IjB
kinase (IKK), respectively, which produces type I interferons (IFNs)
and cytokines after translocation into the nucleus.26,27 Recent studies
suggested that endogenous DNA released and/or leaked from the
nucleus or mitochondria into the cytoplasm also activates this pathway, and a link between STING and the pathogenesis of various diseases such as tumourgenesis, vasculitis, autoimmune diseases, and
lifestyle-related diseases.26-32 However, the role of STING signalling
in atherogenesis remains obscure.
In this study, we hypothesized that STING signalling promotes vascular inflammation and atherogenesis. To address our hypothesis,
we performed in vivo studies using apolipoprotein E-deficient
(Apoe/) mice and Apoe/ mice, which genetically lack Sting
(Sting/Apoe/mice), and in vitro experiments using macrophages
because pro-inflammatory activation of macrophages is an essential
feature of the development of atherogenesis.33 Furthermore, we
examined the expression of cGAMP, a STING agonist, in atherosclerotic lesions in mice and humans to obtain clinically translatable evidence showing the contribution of STING signalling to atherogenesis.
The results of our study proposed a novel mechanism involving
STING, a player in the innate immune system, in vascular inflammation and atherogenesis, and suggested the potential of a therapeutic
strategy targeting STING for atherosclerotic diseases.

STING, a cytosolic DNA sensor, plays a critical role in atherogenesis

Bone marrow-specific expression of
stimulator of interferon genes promoted
atherogenesis in Apoe/ mice
Immune cells such as macrophages are major populations that express STING. We, therefore, performed bone marrow (BM) transplantation to investigate the role of STING in BM cells in
atherogenesis (Supplementary material online, Figure S4). Restoration
of STING in BM in Sting/Apoe/ mice increased atherosclerotic
lesions in the aortic arch (P = 0.017) and in the aortic root
(P = 0.005), and lipid deposition and inflammatory features in atherosclerotic plaques compared with BM-chimeric mice, which do not
have STING in their body (Figure 3A-C, Supplementary material online, Figure S5). The results of quantitative polymerase chain reaction
(qPCR) demonstrated that BM-specific STING expression in
Apoe/ mice promoted the expression of inflammatory molecules
in the abdominal aorta compared with control BM-chimeric mice
(Figure 3D). Bone marrow-specific STING expression also increased
the phosphorylation of TBK1 in the aorta (Figure 3E). There were no
significant differences in metabolic parameters and blood pressure
(Supplementary material online, Table S3). These results indicated
that STING in BM cells contributes to the development of vascular
inflammation and atherogenesis.

Stimulator of interferon genes signal
promoted pro-inflammatory activation
of macrophages
Next, we examined the roles of STING in pro-inflammatory activation of macrophages. Treatments with cGAMP, a specific STING
agonist, significantly promoted the expression of inflammatory molecules (e.g. Tnf-a, Ccl2, and Ifn-b) in Apoe/ macrophages, but not in
Sting/Apoe/ macrophages (Figure 4A, Supplementary material online, Figure S6A). The results of western blot analysis showed that
cGAMP activated both TBK1 signalling and NF-jB signalling in
Apoe/ macrophages (Figure 4B). These results suggested that
STING signalling accelerated pro-inflammatory activation of macrophages. In addition to cGAMP, we stimulated macrophages with
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) because cGAMP is generated from
DNA fragments in the cytosol.24,25 As observed in cGAMP treatment, mtDNA promoted expression of inflammatory molecules and

activated both TBK1 signalling and NF-jB signalling more effectively
in Apoe/ macrophages than in Sting/Apoe/ macrophages
(Figure 4C and D, Supplementary material online, Figure S6B). These
results indicated that mtDNA activated macrophages at least partially
via STING signalling.

Inhibition of stimulator of interferon
genes signalling attenuated
pro-inflammatory activation of
macrophages
We further investigated the effect of STING inhibition on macrophage activation. C-176, a specific STING inhibitor, or amlexanox, a
TBK1 inhibitor, ameliorated cGAMP-induced expression of inflammatory molecules such as Tnf-a, Ccl2, and Ifn-b (Figure 5A and B).
These results suggested that the TBK1 pathway participates in
STING-mediated inflammatory responses in macrophages at least in
part. Similarly, C-176 partially suppressed expression of these inflammatory molecules induced by mtDNA in Apoe/ macrophages
(Figure 5C), while amlexanox reduced only Ifn-b expression but not
other inflammatory molecules such as Tnf-a under stimulation with
mtDNA (Figure 5D). The results of Enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) that used culture medium obtained from macrophages
confirmed these results (Figure 5E and F). Additionally, in this study,
we confirmed the role of STING signalling in macrophage activation
by using other types of macrophage such as RAW264.7 cells, residential peritoneal macrophages, and BM-derived macrophages
(Supplementary material online, Figures S7-S9). These results suggested that STING and its downstream molecule, TBK1, partially participate in mtDNA-induced macrophage activation.

Inhibition of stimulator of interferon
genes ameliorated atherogenesis in
Apoe/ mice
To investigate whether inhibition of STING attenuates atherogenesis,
we administered C-176 to Apoe/ mice fed WTD. After 12 weeks
of treatment, C-176 significantly reduced atherosclerotic lesions in
the aortic arch (P = 0.025) and in the aortic root (P = 0.031), and lipid
deposition in atherosclerotic plaques (P = 0.006) compared with vehicle (Figure 6A and B). However, in this study, we did not observe significant reduction of macrophage accumulation in atherosclerotic
lesions and inflammatory features in the treatment group compared
with the vehicle group (Figure 6C, Supplementary material online,
Figure S10). However, C-176 decreased TBK1 phosphorylation in the
aorta, suggesting inhibition of STING signalling at least partially
(Figure 6D). C-176 did not affect metabolic parameters and blood
pressure in Apoe/ mice (Supplementary material online, Table S4).
These results suggested the potential of STING signalling as a therapeutic target of atherosclerosis.

Stimulator of interferon genes signalling
in human atherosclerotic lesions
Finally, we examined the clinical significance of STING signalling in
human atherosclerotic lesions obtained by carotid endarterectomy.

deletion of Sting reduced the expression of inflammatory molecules
such as Tnf-a (P = 0.007), Ccl2 (P = 0.001), Ifn-b (P = 0.024), and macrophage marker, F4/80 (P = 0.014) in the aorta (Figure 2D). Sting deletion
also reduced the phosphorylation of TBK1 and attenuated the degradation of IjBa in the atherosclerotic aorta, suggesting inhibition of
TBK1 signalling and NF-jB signalling (P = 0.011 and P = 0.009, respectively) (Figure 2E). Bodyweight of Sting/Apoe/ mice was smaller
than that of Apoe/ mice; however, metabolic parameters and blood
pressure were comparable between the two mouse strains
(Supplementary material online, Table S1). These results indicated that
STING signalling plays a pivotal role in vascular inflammation and
atherogenesis in Apoe/ mice fed a WTD. Genetic deletion of
STING also attenuated atherogenesis in normal chow-fed Apoe/
mice, though it elevated plasma triglyceride level (Supplementary material online, Figure S3 and Table S2).

other hand, we could not detect cGAMP in normal carotid arteries
(n = 4) (Figure 7D and E). In addition, treatments with cGAMP or
mtDNA promoted the expression of inflammatory molecules in
human primary macrophages (Figure 7F and G). These results suggested that STING signalling participates, at least partially, in the development of atherosclerosis in humans.

Discussion

STING as a secondary messenger.38 mtDNA, as expected, markedly
promoted inflammatory molecule expression in Apoe/ macrophages compared with Sting/Apoe/ macrophages. The results of
immunohistochemistry on atherosclerotic lesions indicated that the
expression of anti-inflammatory macrophage marker was associated
with the absence of STING, supporting pro-inflammatory role of
STING in macrophage activation. The results of western blotting
demonstrated that both cGAMP and mtDNA activate the NF-jB
and TBK1 pathways, major pathways under STING signalling, in macrophages consistent with the results of our in vivo study. Meanwhile,
C-176, a STING inhibitor, diminished cGAMP- or mtDNA-induced
macrophage activation (e.g. Tnf-a, Ccl2, and Ifn-b expression). On the
other hand, a TBK1 inhibitor suppressed the expression of these
molecules from macrophage induced by cGAMP; however, in the response to mtDNA, the TBK1 inhibitor suppressed only IFN-b expression. This result suggests that other DNA sensors and/or
pathways might also play roles in mtDNA-induced macrophage activation. It is important to note that we revealed the presence of
cGAMP in the atherosclerotic aorta by using a highly sensitive LS-MS/
MS method. Previous studies proposed an interaction between
STING and self-derived DNA and its contribution to disease processes; however, detection of cGAMP was carried out only at the cellular level in in vitro experiments.39,40 Our results demonstrating
cGAMP in atherosclerotic lesions in humans and mice provide evidence for the role of STING signalling in the development of atherosclerosis. Our results suggested a pivotal role of STING activation by
self-derived DNA in provoking inflammatory activation of macrophages, at least partially, contributing to the development of vascular
inflammation and atherosclerosis.
In this study, we also demonstrated that pharmacological blockade
of STING using C-176 suppressed atherosclerotic lesion development and lipid deposition in plaques partially through TBK1 inhibition,
although its effects were relatively modest. A previous study also
demonstrated that inhibition of TBK1 could improve sporadic aortic
aneurysm development in different mouse model.28 Thus, our present study suggested that STING might be a therapeutic target against
vascular inflammation and atherogenesis. DNA-sensing mechanisms
generally have a protective role in self-defence as part of the innate
immune system, although this system also promotes inflammation inappropriately in certain disease contexts. However, the initiating
stimuli still remain obscure. Further studies are required to establish
therapeutic strategies targeting STING against atherosclerotic vascular diseases.
There are several limitations in this study. First, we used Apoe/
mice fed a WTD. The role of STING was partially confirmed with
normal chow-fed Apoe/ mice, although our mouse models induce
atherogenesis strongly. In addition, ApoE is a multifunctional protein.
Therefore, this model might not be the best model to investigate the
role of STING in atherogenesis, especially for humans. Second, we
observed the difference in bodyweight between Sting/Apoe/
mice and Apoe/ mice under WTD-fed condition, although there
were no phenotypical differences including metabolic parameters between these two strains of mouse. We also could not observe differences in bodyweight in other experiments such as BM
transplantation and pharmacological blockade. In addition, plasma triglyceride level was higher in Sting/Apoe/ mice compared with
Apoe/ mice under NC-fed condition, though there was no

Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease1; however; understanding the molecular mechanisms of chronic inflammation in the
vasculature remains a major medical challenge. The present study
addressed a new insight into the underlying mechanism of atherosclerosis associated with STING signalling, which was originally
known as a cytosolic DNA-sensing mechanism. Here, we found that
atherosclerotic lesions obtained from both human and mouse
expressed STING and its ligand, cGAMP. Genetic or pharmacological
blockade of STING, or BM-specific expression of STING in Apoe/
mice demonstrated the contribution of STING signalling to the development of atherosclerosis partially through the TBK1 and NF-jB
pathways without alteration of metabolic parameters and blood
pressure. The results of in vitro experiments using human and mouse
macrophages indicated the involvement of STING signalling in pro-inflammatory activation of macrophages. These results suggested a pivotal role of STING in atherogenesis (Graphical abstract).
The contribution of the innate immune system activated by endogenous ligands to the pathophysiology of various inflammatory diseases including atherosclerosis has attracted much attention.2,5
Exogenous nucleic acids, especially those from bacteria and viruses,
strongly induce inflammation through the recognition by DNA sensors for self-defence,3 while recent studies have revealed that DNA
fragments released from or accumulated in host cells also provoke inflammation as endogenous ligands by using DNA sensors.34 In addition to TLR9, a most studied DNA sensor, recent studies suggested
a link between STING and various disease conditions.26-32
Furthermore, several studies have demonstrated that inherited activating mutation of STING is associated with vasculopathy in
humans,35-37 suggesting a link between STING signalling and vascular
inflammation. Also, other studies reported the contribution of
STING to the development of sporadic aortic aneurysm28 or insulin
resistance,29 both of which, as well as atherosclerosis, share chronic
inflammation as an underlying mechanism. However, the role of
STING signalling in the development of vascular inflammation and
atherosclerosis remains largely unknown.
In this study, we observed features of DNA damage such as the expression of cH2AX and p53, and the accumulation of ssDNA in macrophages in the atherosclerotic aorta obtained from Apoe/ mice, a
hypercholesterolaemic mouse model, suggesting release and accumulation of DNA fragments in atherosclerotic lesions, which consequently activate DNA sensors including STING. In fact, the level of
cGAMP, a STING agonist, in the aorta was higher in Apoe/ mice,
and cGAMP increased inflammatory molecule expression in Apoe/
macrophages but not in Sting/Apoe/ macrophages. Next, we
examined whether DNA fragments cause pro-inflammatory activation of macrophages via STING signalling, because cGAMP generated
by the action of cGAS from DNA fragments in the cytosol activates

difference between bodyweight and other lipid levels. Several studies
suggested a link between metabolic parameters and innate immune
system.41-43 Further studies are required to reveal the effects of
STING on metabolic parameters. Third, we demonstrated the presence of DNA damage and cGAMP in hypercholesterolaemia-associated atherosclerotic mouse aorta; however, the mechanisms for
DNA damage and subsequent release of DNA fragments are not fully
understood. Other metabolic abnormalities may also contribute to
STING activation through DNA damage. Clarifying the mechanism
by which lifestyle-related diseases cause DNA damage requires further studies. Fourth, the number of samples in our clinical study was
small, and a large-scale study is required to confirm our results. We
used macroscopically normal carotid artery samples as the control,
although these might not serve as the adequate control because of
the difference in background including surgical methods for sample
collection. To examine the role of STING in atherogenesis, further
studies targeting other part of arteries such as the coronary artery
may be needed because atherosclerotic disease has broad and complex spectrum.44
Our study demonstrated that STING signalling contributes to the
development of atherogenesis via pro-inflammatory activation of
macrophages. We also demonstrated the presence of STING and
cGAMP in human atherosclerotic lesions, providing clinically translatable evidence for the pro-inflammatory and pro-atherogenic role of
STING signalling. Stimulator of interferon genes signalling may explain
the link between innate immunity and chronic inflammation caused
by lifestyle-related diseases. In conclusion, DNA damage caused by
lifestyle-associated diseases and subsequent STING activation plays,
at least partially, a causal role in atherosclerosis. Our findings shed
new insights into the pathogenesis of vascular inflammation and
atherogenesis, and suggest that STING signalling might be a potential
therapeutic target against atherosclerotic vascular diseases.
