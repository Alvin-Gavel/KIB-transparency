Aims

Distinctive types of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) respond differently to different forms of therapy.
We therefore performed the present study to define the electrocardiographic characteristics of different forms of
polymorphic VT.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
We studied 190 patients for whom the onset of 305 polymorphic VT events was available. The study group
and results
included 87 patients with coronary artery disease who had spontaneous polymorphic VT triggered by shortcoupled extrasystoles in the absence of myocardial ischaemia. This group included 32 patients who had a long QT
interval but nevertheless had their polymorphic VT triggered by ectopic beats with short coupling interval, a
subcategory termed 'pseudo-torsade de pointes] (TdP). For comparison, we included 50 patients who had
ventricular fibrillation (VF) during acute myocardial infarction ('ischaemic VF' group) and 53 patients with druginduced TdP ('true TdP' group). The QT of patients with pseudo-TdP was (by definition) longer than that of
patients with polymorphic VT and normal QT (QTc 491.4 +/- 25.2 ms vs. 447.3 +/- 55.6 ms, P < 0.001). However, their
QT was significantly shorter than that of patients with true TdP (QTc 564.6 +/- 75.6 ms, P < 0.001). Importantly,
the coupling interval of the ectopic beat triggering the arrhythmia was just as short during pseudo-TdP as during
polymorphic VT with normal QT (359.1 +/- 38.1 ms vs. 356.6 +/- 39.4 ms, P = 0.467) but was much shorter than
during true TdP (581.2 +/- 95.3 ms, P < 0.001).

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusions
The coupling interval helps discriminate between polymorphic VT that occurs despite a long QT interval
(pseudo-TdP) and polymorphic arrhythmias striking because of a long QT (true TdP).

Introduction
Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) is a malignant tachyarrhythmia with changing QRS pattern that will either terminate spontaneously (causing syncope if it lasts more than a few seconds) or will
deteriorate to ventricular fibrillation (VF), causing cardiac arrest.1
Defining the aetiology of polymorphic VT is of outmost importance
because different forms of polymorphic VT respond to different forms
of therapy. On the one hand, torsade de pointes (TdP), defined as the
polymorphic VT caused by a long QT syndrome (LQTS), responds to
beta-blocker therapy, intravenous magnesium, and cardiac pacing.2 On
the other hand, several forms of polymorphic VT not associated with
QT prolongation, including the polymorphic VT of Brugada syndrome,3,4 short QT syndrome,5 and idiopathic VF,6-10 are resistant to
the above therapies but are highly responsive to quinidine.
Recently, we reported that arrhythmic storms caused by polymorphic VT in patients with coronary artery disease in the absence
of acute myocardial ischaemia are also responsive to quinidine
therapy when other antiarrhythmic drugs fail.11,12 Some of our
patients with quinidine-responsive polymorphic VT had a prolonged
QT interval, either because they were recovering from a recent
myocardial ischaemic insult,13,14 or more commonly, because they
had received amiodarone and failed to respond.11,12 This observation

mandates reassessment of the definition of TdP: distinguishing
polymorphic VT occurring because of a long QT, from polymorphic
VT occurring in spite of a long QT, is now imperative. For the former,
'true TdP', quinidine, a QT-prolonging medication, is obviously
contraindicated. For the latter, 'pseudo-TdP', quinidine appears
to be the drug of choice during arrhythmic storms.11,12 We
therefore conducted the present study to better define the
electrocardiographic (ECG) characteristics of quinidine-responsive
polymorphic VT-with and without QT prolongation-using the
two following control groups as comparators: the first comparator
was a 'negative-control' group with a well-defined form of
polymorphic VT not related to QT prolongation. This group
consisted of patients with 'ischaemic VF', defined as polymorphic
VT/VF occurring during the ST-segment elevation phase of an acute
myocardial infarction. The second comparator was a 'positive
control' of bona fide LQTS, consisting of adult patients with LQTS.

Methods
The present study includes a total of 190 patients with spontaneous polymorphic ventricular tachyarrhythmias. A total of 305 arrhythmic episodes
of polymorphic arrhythmias for which the mode of onset was available,
were analysed in detail. Patients were classified into three different groups

..
.. at the time of obvious ST-segment elevation (Figure 2C). The arrhythmia

.. LQTS for whom the onset of spontaneous TdP had been documented

..
.. with TdP storm at the age of 60 years) had drug-induced TdP. A total of

For all patients and controls, we analysed the following ECG parame.. ters: (i) basic heart rate, QRS, QT, and QTc (QRS-adjusted QTc for

.. (usually a post-extrasystolic pause creating a typical short-long-short se..
.. quence25-27 or, less commonly, by a sudden increment in cycle length

(Figure 1). The study group included 87 patients with coronary artery
disease who developed spontaneous polymorphic VT in the absence of
evident myocardial ischaemia. The clinical characteristics and response to
quinidine therapy of the study group have been described in detail.11,12 In
brief, this group consists of patients with polymorphic VT initiated by ventricular extrasystoles displaying short coupling interval.11,12,15,16,18 Several
studies15,16,18 confirm that these short-coupled ectopic beats originate
from ischaemia-resistant Purkinje fibres19 that endured in areas of myocardial scar.16 We have used the term 'angry Purkinje syndrome' to describe this phenomenon.20 Patients with this form of polymorphic
VT characteristically develop arrhythmic storms that are refractory to
beta-blockers, lidocaine, mexiletine, class 1C drugs, and amiodarone,16
but are highly responsive to quinidine therapy.11,12 In our own series,
only 1 (2.1%) of 47 patients who received intravenous amiodarone
responded to this drug, 45 (98%) of the 46 patients who received
quinidine responded. This study group of patients with polymorphic VT
related to coronary disease without evident acute myocardial ischaemia
is referred throughout, for brevity, as 'the polymorphic VT group'. The
arrhythmia onset was available for 152 arrhythmic episodes.
This polymorphic VT group of 87 patients was further stratified, based
on the QT interval during sinus rhythm recorded shortly before the
onset of arrhythmias, into two subgroups of polymorphic VT (Figure 1):
(i) a subgroup of patients with short-coupled polymorphic VT and normal
QT (referred here as the 'polymorphic VT with normal QT group';
Figures 1 and 2A); and (ii) the second subgroup consisted of otherwise
similar patients who had a long QT interval but nevertheless had their
polymorphic VT initiated by short-coupled ventricular extrasystoles
(referred here as 'pseudo-TdP group'; Figures 2B and 3). A total of 57 episodes of pseudo-TdP were studied. Long QT was defined as a QTc
>_450 ms for males and >_460 ms for females (these values represent the
97th to 99th percentile of the normal QT).21 For patients with wide QRS
(defined as QRS >_120 ms during sinus rhythm), we used a QRS-adjusted
QTc.22 This QRS-adjusted QTc represents the QTc that would be
expected if these patients had narrow QRS. It is calculated by adding their
measured JTc to an ideal QRS, where JTc = QTc-QRS.22 The ideal QRS
is 95 ms wide for men and 88 ms wide for women.23

Comparison of polymorphic ventricular
tachycardia with ischaemic ventricular
fibrillation
The polymorphic VT group and the ischaemic VF group were predominantly of male gender but patients with ischaemic VF presented

at younger age (Table 1). Patients with ischaemic VF had shorter QT
interval (Figure 3A). Of all arrhythmic episodes, only 8.9% of ischaemic
VF episodes, but 31.6% of polymorphic VT episodes, were pausedependent (P < 0.001). Regardless of the mode of onset, the coupling
interval of the beat triggering the arrhythmia was short in both
groups, but was significantly shorter during ischaemic VF (305 +/- 53
vs. 358 +/- 39 ms, P < 0.001). The arrhythmia was significantly faster
during ischaemic VF (Table 1 and Figure 4D).

shorter in ischaemic ventricular fibrillation (310 ms, C) but very long in torsade de pointes (650 ms in D). Also, note that the ventricular rate is fastest
for ischaemic ventricular fibrillation, fast for polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, and relatively slow for torsade de pointes.

Comparison of polymorphic ventricular
tachycardia with torsade de pointes,
including comparison of pseudo-torsade
with true torsade de pointes
In contrast to all other groups, female gender predominated in the
group of drug-induced TdP (Table 2). Within the polymorphic VT
group, 52 patients had normal QT interval. In three additional
patients, the QT could not be accurately defined because all traces
prior to the onset of polymorphic VT showed ventricular bigeminy.
Finally, 32 patients with polymorphic VT had a long QT interval and
are referred here as patients with pseudo-TdP (Figure 1). A total of
74 episodes of pseudo-TdP with documentation of the arrhythmia
onset were available for review.
By definition, the QT of patients with pseudo-TdP was longer than
that of patients with polymorphic VT and normal QT (QTc
491 +/- 25 ms vs. 426 +/- 33 ms, P < 0.001) (Table 2 and Figure 4).
Nevertheless, the coupling interval of the beat triggering pseudo-TdP
(359 +/- 38 ms) was just as short as the coupling interval triggering
polymorphic VT with normal QT (358 +/- 39 ms, P = 0.4).
The most important comparison is that of pseudo-TdP with true
TdP (Table 2, Figures 4B-D and 5). Although the QT was long in both
groups, it was significantly longer in true TdP (QTc of 491 +/- 25 ms for
patients with pseudo-TdP vs QTc of 565 +/- 76 ms for true TdP,
P < 0.001). Nevertheless, there was significant overlap between the
QTc of patients with pseudo-TdP and that of patients with true TdP.

Specifically, 78% of patients with pseudo-TdP and 54% of patients
with true TdP had a QTc within the range of overlap (QTc between
470 and 550 ms). On the other hand, the coupling interval provided
good discrimination between pseudo-TdP and true TdP: only 2 (6%)
patients with pseudo-TdP had a coupling interval longer than 400 ms.
The first is a 75-year-old female patient who developed an arrhythmic storm (3 days after coronary bypass surgery) that failed to respond to intravenous lidocaine, magnesium, and amiodarone
(Figure 6). The coupling interval of the ectopic beat triggering VT
events ranged from 416 to 446 ms (Figure 6B and C). Her 12-lead
ECG revealed that the ectopic beats had a narrow QRS (Figure 6A)
with a coupling interval of 400 ms. She was treated with quinidine and
had an immediate response. The second patient with pseudo-TdP
and coupling interval >400 ms had two episodes of VF; one started
with a coupling interval of 446 ms but the other one had a coupling
interval of 390 ms. In contrast, the vast majority (94.3%) of patients
with true TdP had arrhythmias starting with a coupling interval longer
than 400 ms. The remaining 3 (5.7%) patients with true TdP had a
coupling interval of 400 ms: two had drug-induced TdP (one male
with a QTc of 495 ms from methadone and one female with a QTc
of 519 ms from levofloxacin); the third patient has genotype-negative
congenital LQTS who presented with recurrent implantable
cardioverter-defibrillator shocks due to TdP refractory to betablockers. Based on recent reports,28-30 she was treated with mexiletine with a good response.

Figure 3 Two examples of pseudo-torsade de pointes. (A) This is from the same patient shown in Figure 2B. He developed an arrhythmic storm
with frequent episodes of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia while receiving amiodarone. Note that his QT is not only very long (QTc 511 ms) but
also has highly abnormal morphology with notched T waves (arrows). However, the coupling interval of the ventricular tachycardia is short (360 ms),
demonstrating that the polymorphic ventricular tachycardia is occurring despite the long QT and not because of it. (B) This is from a 62-year-old male
who has an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator and receives sotalol for monomorphic ventricular tachycardia. He presented with recurrent polymorphic ventricular tachycardia triggering numerous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shocks (not shown). He was originally diagnosed with torsade de pointes because of a QTc of 505 ms while on sotalol and he was therefore treated with potassium and magnesium supplements while the
atrial pacing rate of his device was increased to 80 b.p.m. These interventions failed to abort his arrhythmic storm and he received a total of 13 shocks.
The relatively short coupling interval (400 ms) prompted initiation of quinidine with an immediate response. He has been free of arrhythmias for
5 years.

Regarding the mode of onset, 31.6% of pseudo-TdP events but
71.6% of true TdP episodes, were pause-dependent (P < 0.001).
Regardless of their mode of onset, the ventricular rate during
tachycardia, as assessed by RR intervals of the first four arrhythmia
complexes of VT (excluding the coupling interval), was fastest during
ischaemic VF (average heart rate of 278 b.p.m.), intermediate for
polymorphic VT (245 b.p.m.), and was relatively slow for TdP
(average of 183 b.p.m.) (Figure 4D).

Discussion
Distinctive types of polymorphic VT respond differently to different
forms of therapy. In fact, interventions that are ineffective, or
even contraindicated for one type, may be the treatment of

small circles). Values for ischaemic ventricular fibrillation appear in black, values for drug-induced torsade de pointes (TDP) in red, and values
for polymorphic ventricular tachycardia appear in blue [light blue for polymorphic ventricular tachycardia with normal QT and dark blue for
polymorphic ventricular tachycardia with long QT (pseudo-TDP)]. In (A-C), P-values are shown for comparisons between two adjacent

comparisons, P-values are <0.001 for all groups. Note that the QT is shortest for ischaemic ventricular fibrillation, intermediate for
polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and longest for true TDP (A). By definition, the QT interval of patients with pseudo-TDP was longer than
of the remaining patients with polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (dark blue vs. light blue in B) but shorter than the QT of true TDP (B).
Despite their longer QT interval, episodes of pseudo-TDP had a coupling interval that was as short as that of polymorphic ventricular
tachycardia with normal QT and significantly shorter than the coupling interval of true TDP (C). Once the tachycardia started, the ventricular
rate was fastest during ischaemic ventricular fibrillation. The ventricular rate during polymorphic ventricular tachycardia was also fast
(regardless of the QT interval) and significantly faster that the ventricular rate during true TDP (D).

ischaemic VF were, on average, 7 years younger. This finding is
consistent with previous studies suggesting that younger age at
the time of myocardial infarction is associated with increased risk
of primary VF.31 Also, the QT interval prior to the onset of the
arrhythmia was shorter for patients with ischaemic VF, a finding
consistent with in vitro studies showing significant shortening of
the action potential during simulated ischaemia.32 Finally, in
both polymorphic VT and ischaemic VF, the initiating beat of the
arrhythmia had a short coupling interval, yet shorter during ischaemic VF. In fact, the coupling interval at the time of ischaemic
VF initiation is among the shortest recorded,33 comparable only

to that of idiopathic VF, an arrhythmia notorious for an ultra-short
coupling interval.34
The mechanism of the short-coupled polymorphic VT patients
with coronary disease has been well described in humans.
Patients with this type of arrhythmia characteristically develop arrhythmic storms that are resistant to conventional antiarrhythmic
therapy.11,12,16 Consequently, several studies have provided
detailed information collected during endocardial mapping at the
time of ablation procedures.15-17 Recording of the sites of onset
of spontaneous arrhythmias in humans demonstrates that ectopic
beats originating from the Purkinje fibres, surviving within areas of

Figure 5 Examples of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia with long QT interval and short coupling interval pseudo-torsade de pointes and
true torsade de pointes. In all traces, the QTc is shown in blue, the coupling interval of the beat starting the ventricular tachycardia in read,
and the average ventricular rate during the first five beats of ventricular tachycardia in black. The QTc for traces showing ventricular
bigeminy was measured in additional traces from the patient (now shown). (A-C) Pseudo-torsade de pointes in three different male patients

Drug-induced torsade de pointes in female patients (age 60-82 years). The torsade de pointes was caused by amitriptyline, high-dose trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and citalopram (D, E, and F, respectively). All patients with torsade de pointes had concomitant hypokalaemia.
Note that the QT interval is prolonged in all six cases shown here, but it is appreciably longer in the three patients with true torsade de pointes
(D-F). Furthermore, the coupling interval (in red) and the ventricular cycle length during tachycardia (in black) are shorter for patients with
pseudo-torsade de pointes.

myocardial scar, initiate these recurrent arrhythmias.15-17 On the
other hand, data on the mode of onset of ischaemic VF are
available only from animal studies and in vitro preparations with
simulated ischaemia.35 Phase 2 re-entry (from non-ischaemic
areas to ischaemic zones with abbreviated action potential) has
been proposed to explain the mechanism of the ultra-short coupling during ischaemic VF.36

Comparison of polymorphic ventricular
tachycardia and torsade de pointes
Polymorphic VT with normal QT is easily distinguishable from
TdP. Thus, the comparison of interest if that of pseudo-TdP with
true TdP. In agreement with previous studies,37,38 the TdP group,
which consisted almost exclusively of patients with drug-induced

TdP, was predominantly of female gender. Both the pseudo-TdP
and the true TdP groups had a long QT interval, but the QT was
appreciably longer in the TdP group. The QT of patients with true
TdP in our study (QTc 565 +/- 76 ms) is consistent with the observation that the risk of TdP, among patients with LQTS, rises significantly as the QTc prolongs above 500 ms. In fact, other
studies report even longer QT intervals, at the time of TdP, for
patients with congenital or drug-induced LQTS (QTc of 589 +/- 85
and 594 +/- 84 ms, respectively).25,26 Nevertheless, significant
overlap existed between the QTc of our pseudo-TdP and true
TdP groups (Figure 4B). On the other hand, the coupling interval
of the beat initiating the tachycardia provided good distinction
between pseudo and true TdP, with a value of 400 ms providing
excellent discrimination. Since patients in both groups tend to

have recurrent arrhythmias; shorter (or longer) coupling intervals,
observed in other events, are expected to facilitate the distinction.
Interestingly, the ventricular rate during VT differed between
groups, it was fastest for ischaemic VF and slowest for TdP.
The long refractory period associated with action potential prolongation probably serves as a rate-limiting factor in TdP.

Limitations
This is a retrospective analysis of mostly a single-centre study experience. Its main limitation is the absence of a gold standard to define
pseudo-TdP. One could argue that patients with pseudo-TdP have, in
fact, true TdP with shorter QT interval and shorter coupling interval.
However, the phenotype of polymorphic VT in the absence of apparent myocardial ischaemia, including the short coupling interval of
ectopics triggering polymorphic VT, has been well-defined in
numerous studies.11,12,15-17 The fact that quinidine is highly effective
in suppressing this arrhythmic phenomenon strongly argues against a
diagnosis of TdP for these patients. As a reminder, the diagnosis of
TdP has always been a clinical diagnosis, and appropriate therapy is
delivered despite the absence of a gold standard for that diagnosis
as well.
The second important limitation relates to the limited
number of patients in the different categories. It is possible
that as new patients are recognized, the coupling interval cut-off

Figure 6 Electrocardiograms of a patient with pseudo-torsade de pointes with relatively long coupling interval. This 75-year-old female
developed an arrhythmic storm 5 days after coronary bypass surgery. She has left bundle branch block with a QRS of 156 ms and a QTc of
560 ms (measured before the onset of ventricular bigeminy). The JTc is 404 ms and her adjusted QTc 484 ms (see text). She had multiple
ventricular fibrillation episodes requiring defibrillation and failed to respond to intravenous lidocaine, magnesium, and amiodarone. Urgent
catheterization showed a known critical lesion in the left anterior descending and a significant stenosis at the anastomosis of an arterial graft to
the distal left anterior descending. The left anterior descending underwent dilatation and stenting. However, she continued to have recurrent
ventricular fibrillation and ultimately was treated with quinidine with immediate response. Note that the coupling interval during different ventricular tachycardia episodes ranged from 416 to 446 ms (B and C). Importantly, her 12-lead electrocardiographic recording shows
ectopic beats with a relatively narrow QRS (*). In fact, the ectopic beats (marked with the sign * in A) have a QRS width of 99 ms, which is
narrower than the QRS during sinus rhythm and have a coupling interval of 400 ms, revealing the true nature of her arrhythmia: pseudotorsade de pointes.
