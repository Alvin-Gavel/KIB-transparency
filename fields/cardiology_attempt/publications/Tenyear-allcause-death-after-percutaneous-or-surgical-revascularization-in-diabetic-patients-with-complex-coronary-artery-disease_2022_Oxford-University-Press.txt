patients with diabetes? Importance of interpretation biases and biological plausibility', by W.E. Boden, R. De Caterina, and D.P. Taggart,
https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab445.

Aims

The aim of this article was to compare rates of all-cause death at 10 years following coronary artery bypass grafting
(CABG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with or without diabetes.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
The SYNTAXES study evaluated up to 10-year survival of 1800 patients with three-vessel disease (3VD) and/or left main coronary artery disease (LMCAD) randomized to receive either PCI or CABG in the SYNTAX trial. Ten-year all-cause death
and results

according to diabetic status and revascularization strategy was examined. In diabetics (n = 452), the risk of mortality was numerically higher with PCI compared with CABG at 5 years [19.6% vs. 13.3%, hazard ratio (HR): 1.53, 95% confidence interval
(CI): 0.96, 2.43, P = 0.075], with the opposite seen between 5 and 10 years (PCI vs. CABG: 20.8% vs. 24.4%, HR: 0.82, 95% CI:
0.52, 1.27, P = 0.366). Irrespective of diabetic status, there was no significant difference in all-cause death at 10 years between
patients receiving PCI or CABG, the absolute treatment difference was 1.9% in diabetics (PCI vs. CABG: 36.4% vs. 34.5%, difference: 1.9%, 95% CI: -7.6%, 11.1%, P = 0.551). Among insulin-treated patients (n = 182), all-cause death at 10 years was numerically higher with PCI (47.9% vs. 39.6%, difference: 8.2%, 95% CI: -6.5%, 22.5%, P = 0.227).

Ten-year all-cause death after percutaneous or
surgical revascularization in diabetic patients
with complex coronary artery disease

57

10-year mortality in patients with diabetes in the SYNTAX Extended Survival Study

Conclusions

The treatment effects of PCI vs. CABG on all-cause death at 10 years in patients with 3VD and/or LMCAD were
similar irrespective of the presence of diabetes. There may, however, be a survival benefit with CABG in patients
with insulin-treated diabetes. The association between revascularization strategy and very long-term ischaemic and
safety outcomes for patients with diabetes needs further investigation in dedicated trials.

Introduction
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major comorbidity and affects
nearly a third of diabetics.1 Diabetes is associated with worse outcomes after coronary revascularization and has been identified as an
independent predictor of adverse events in patients with CVD.2
The first randomized trial dedicated to diabetics (CARDia) demonstrated that percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) had an
increased rate of the composite primary endpoint of all-cause death,
myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke at 12 months compared with
coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery.3 Subsequently, the

FREEDOM trial showed that CABG was superior to drug-eluting
stents (DES) for the composite primary endpoint of death, stroke,
and MI at 5 years.4 Similarly, the diabetes subgroup analysis of the
SYNTAX study reported that PCI resulted in higher rates of 5-year
MACCE (major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular event: a
composite endpoint of all-cause death, cerebrovascular accident, MI,
or repeat revascularization), compared with CABG, which was
driven by a higher rate of repeat revascularization.5 Moreover, a recent pooled analysis of individual patient data demonstrated that diabetes had a significant treatment interaction between PCI and CABG
for 5-year all-cause mortality.6 Based on these findings in this specific

The treatment effects of PCI versus CABG on all-cause death at 10 years in 3VD/LMCAD patients with pharmacologically treated diabetes and insulintreated diabetes.

58

Methods
Study design
The design and the primary results of the SYNTAX study have been
reported previously.10-12 Briefly, all-comer patients with de novo 3VD
and/or LMCAD deemed to be eligible for both PCI and CABG were
enrolled and randomized to either CABG (n = 897) or PCI (n = 903) with
TAXUS DES (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA, USA). The SYNTAX
trial completed patient follow-up at 5 years.12 The SYNTAXES study was
an investigator-driven initiative that extended follow-up and aimed to
evaluate vital status at up to 10 years.9 The German Heart Research
Foundation (GHF, Frankfurt am Main, Germany) funded the extended
follow-up, which was performed in accordance with local regulations of
each participating centre and complied with the declaration of Helsinki.

Study endpoints
The present analysis is a pre-specified sub-study of the SYNTAXES
study.9 The primary endpoint was all-cause death at 10 years. The secondary endpoint was all-cause death at maximum available follow-up.
Vital status was confirmed by contact with medical care personnel or by
electronic healthcare record review and national death registry. The aim
of the study was to examine the impact of pharmacologically (non-insulin
or insulin) treated diabetes (categorized at the time of randomization),
on subsequent all-cause death at 10 years. The impact of all diabetes
(pharmacological and diet-controlled) on all-cause death at 10 years was
performed as a sensitivity analysis.
The following exploratory analyses were performed: elderly
(>70 years old), anatomical SYNTAX score tertiles (<_22, 23-32, or
>_33), disease type (3VD or LMCAD), impact of haemoglobin A1c
(HbA1c); C-reactive protein (<2, or >_2), residual SYNTAX score
(rSS = 0, >0-4, >4-8, and >8), type of revascularization (single or multiple arterial bypass graft) and optimal medical therapy. Finally, we applied
SYNTAX score II 2020 to the diabetic and non-diabetic population.13

Statistical analysis
Continuous variables are shown as mean +/- standard deviations and are
compared using Student's t-tests or Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical

.. variables are reported as percentages and numbers and are compared
..
.. using v2 tests, or Fisher's exact test when appropriate.
..
Time-to-event Kaplan-Meier estimates with the log-rank test were
..
.. used to compare PCI and CABG in patients with and without diabetes,
.. and to compare diabetes vs. no diabetes in PCI and CABG groups.
..
.. Hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was assessed on the
.. basis of the Cox proportional regression. The mean restricted life ex..
.. pectancy was8 estimated by the area under the survival curve between 0
.. and 10 years. The adjusted cubic spline was used to show the association
.. between HbA1c and the risk of all-cause death at 10 years. Multivariable
..
.. analyses were performed in the Cox proportional hazards regression
.. model to evaluate whether pharmacologically treated or insulin-treated
..
.. diabetes was an independent predictor of all-cause death at 10 years. The
.. following covariates were included: age, gender, body mass index (BMI),
..
.. current smoking, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), chron.. ic obstructive pulmonary disease, creatinine clearance (mL/min), left ven.. tricular ejection fraction (as categorical: good >_50%, moderate: 30-49%,
..
.. and poor: <30%), anatomical SYNTAX score, prior MI, and stroke. All
.. these variables were selected based on the previous knowledge of their
..
.. association with clinical outcomes.14 All analyses were performed using
.. SPSS Statistics, version 25 (IBM Corp., Armonk, 281 NY, USA), and R
..
.. software version 3.5.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna,
.. Austria). A P-value of <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.
..
..
..
.. Results
..
..
.. Baseline characteristics
..
.. Out of 1800 patients, 511 had diabetes, of which 59 were treated by
.. diet alone, and of the remaining 452 treated pharmacologically, 182
..
.. were on insulin. The median maximum follow-up was 11.2 (inter..
.. quartile range: 7.7, 12.1) years. Baseline characteristics according to
.. diabetes are shown in Supplementary material online, Table S1.
..
.. Compared with patients without diabetes, patients with diabetes
.. were more frequently female, had more comorbidities (dyslipidae..
.. mia, PVD, previous stroke, carotid artery disease, and congestive
.. heart failure), had a higher BMI, EuroSCORE, Parsonnet SCORE,
..
.. more frequently had 3VD, with more lesions treated, whereas they
.. were less likely to be current smokers. By randomization, baseline
..
.. characteristics according to revascularization strategy were generally
..
.. well balanced in diabetic and non-diabetic patients (Table 1).
..
..
.. All-cause death according to diabetes
.. Overall compared with patients without diabetes, those with
..
.. pharmacologically treated diabetes had a higher risk of all-cause death
.. at 10 years (35.4% vs. 23.6%, adjusted HR: 1.58, 95% CI: 1.27, 1.95,
..
.. P < 0.001, Figure 1A, Table 2). Similar results were observed for all.. cause death at maximum follow-up (Table 2, Supplementary material
..
.. online, Figure S1). Results were similar when including the 59 patients
.. with diet-controlled diabetes (Supplementary material online, Figures
..
.. S2 and S3).
..
After adjustment for baseline confounders, pharmacologically
..
.. treated diabetes was an independent predictor of all-cause death at
..
.. 10 years in the overall cohort (HR: 1.58, 95% CI: 1.27, 1.95,
.. P < 0.001), the PCI arm (HR: 1.54, 95% CI: 1.15, 2.06, P = 0.003), and
..
.. the CABG arm (HR: 1.65, 95% CI: 1.19, 2.28, P = 0.003,
.. Supplementary material online, Table S2), with poorer outcomes in
..
. those receiving insulin (Supplementary material online, Table S3).

subgroup, current guidelines recommend CABG as the preferred
revascularization procedure in patients with diabetes, especially for
those with multivessel coronary artery diseases (CAD).7 Most available studies have limited follow-up of only 5 years; however, the
BARI trial, which reported outcomes at 10 years, demonstrated that
CABG conferred a survival benefit over PCI with balloon angioplasty
in patients with diabetes and multivessel disease [59%: two-vessel disease and 41%: three-vessel disease (3VD)].8 Whether this benefit
remains in these patients when CABG is compared with PCI with
DES remains to be established.
A suitable population to address this outstanding question comes
from the SYNTAXES study, which established 10-year survival status
in 94% of the 1800 patients with de novo 3VD and/or left main coronary artery disease (LMCAD) who were originally randomized to
CABG or PCI in the SYNTAX trial.9 The aims of the present study
were therefore (i) to evaluate the association between diabetes and
all-cause death at 10 years; (ii) to examine the specific impact of diabetes with insulin dependence on all-cause death at 10 years; (iii) to
investigate the 10-year treatment effect on survival of PCI vs. CABG,
according to diabetes, in patients with complex CAD.

Percentage of deaths at a given time point, based on Kaplan-Meier estimates (number of deaths). The number of patients entered into the multivariable Cox model was 87.2%
(1570/1800) patients in the overall population, 90.0% (813/903) patients in the PCI arm, and 84.4% (757/897) patients in the CABG arm.
CABG, coronary artery bypass grafting; PCI, percutaneous coronary intervention.

All-cause death according to diabetes
and revascularization strategy
In non-diabetics, there was no significant absolute treatment difference in the risk of death at 10 years (PCI 25.8% vs. CABG 21.4%,
difference: 4.4%, 95% CI: -0.2%, 9.0%, P = 0.076, Figure 2B, Supplementary material online, Table S4). The mean restricted life expectancy in non-diabetics was 8.89 and 8.74 years in patient receiving
CABG and PCI, respectively (P = 0.076).
In diabetics, all-cause death at 10 years occurred in 80 (36.4%)
patients in the PCI arm and 72 (34.5%) patients in the CABG arm (difference: 1.9%, 95% CI: -7.6%, 11.1%, P = 0.551, Figure 2A, Table 3 and
Supplementary material online, Table S4). Landmark analyses showed
that the risk of mortality was numerically higher with PCI compared
with CABG at 5 years (19.6% vs. 13.3%, HR: 1.53, 95% CI: 0.96, 2.43,
P = 0.075), with the opposite seen between 5 and 10 years (PCI vs.
CABG: 20.8% vs. 24.4%, HR: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.52, 1.27, P = 0.366, Figure
2A). The mean restricted life expectancy for diabetic patients treated
with CABG and PCI was, respectively, 8.41 and 8.08 years
(P = 0.551). The treatment effect of PCI vs. CABG on mortality at
10 years was not statistically different according to the presence of
diabetes (P-interaction = 0.856, Table 3), with similar findings at maximum follow-up (Table 3 and Supplementary material online, Table S4
and Figure S4) and when including diet-controlled diabetics (Supplementary material online, Figures S5 and S6).

Impact of insulin treatment on all-cause
death
At 10 years, all-cause death occurred in 75 (43.6%) insulin-treated
and 77 (30.0%) non-insulin-treated patients (adjusted HR: 1.59, 95%
CI: 1.10%, 2.29%, P = 0.014, Supplementary material online, Table S5).
Patients receiving insulin had a non-significant numerically higher
all-cause death at 10 years with PCI vs. CABG (47.9% vs. 39.6%, difference: 8.2%, 95% CI: -6.5%, 22.5%, P = 0.227, Table 4 and
Supplementary material online, Table S4), with no significant heterogeneity of treatment effect (P-interaction = 0.971, Table 4). The mean
restricted life expectancy in these patients was possibly longer with
CABG than PCI; however, the differences were not statistically

significant (8.24 vs. 7.55 years, P = 0.230) due to the limited sample
size (n = 182) and restricted power.

Impact of age
No significant interaction between revascularization mode and age
on mortality at 10 years was observed amongst diabetics (P-interaction
= 0.358) and non-diabetics (P-interaction = 0.365, Figure 3).

Impact of haemoglobin A1c on all-cause
death
The spline curve in the overall population showed that an HbA1c of
6.0% had the lowest HR for all-cause death at 10 years, so this was
used as the reference value (Supplementary material online, Figure
S7). The adjusted cubic spline model showed a U-shaped relationship
between HbA1c and all-cause death at 10 years in the overall population (Supplementary material online, Figure S7A) and the PCI arm
(Supplementary material online, Figure S7B), whilst the relationship in
the CABG arm was linear (Supplementary material online, Figure
S7C).

Anatomical SYNTAX score subgroups
In diabetic patients, there were no significant differences in all-cause
death at 10 years and at maximum follow-up between PCI and
CABG groups in any anatomical SYNTAX score tertile (Supplementary material online, Figure S8). In non-diabetic patients with
SYNTAX scores >_33, all-cause death was significantly higher with
PCI at 10 years (32.8% vs. 23.6%, adjusted HR: 1.56, 95% CI: 1.04,
2.33) and at maximum follow-up (38.1% vs. 29.0%, adjusted HR: 1.59,
95% CI: 1.09, 2.32, Supplementary material online, Figure S9).

Three-vessel disease and left main
coronary artery disease subgroups
In diabetic patients with 3VD, PCI and CABG had comparable mortality at 10 years (37.3% vs. 33.5%, adjusted HR: 1.29, 95% CI: 0.81,
2.06, P = 0.289, Supplementary material online, Figure S10A and Table
S6). Landmark analysis showed that mortality was significantly higher
with PCI at 5 years (19.8% vs. 11.3%, adjusted HR: 2.27, 95% CI: 1.14,
4.52, P = 0.020), whereas it was numerically higher with CABG

0.36, 1.37, P = 0.295). In non-diabetic patients with 3VD, the risk of
mortality was significantly higher with PCI at 5 years (12.8% vs. 9.3%,
HR: 2.04, 95% CI: 1.22, 3.41, P = 0.007) and 10 years (25.9% vs.
17.3%, adjusted HR: 1.82, 95% CI: 1.28, 2.60, P = 0.001, Supplementary material online, Table S7).
In patients with LMCAD, there was no significant difference in
mortality at 10 years between PCI and CABG among patients with
diabetes (34.7% vs. 36.1%, adjusted HR: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.48, 1.74,
P = 0.781, Supplementary material online, Table S6, Figure S10B) or
without (25.5% vs. 27.3%, adjusted HR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.60, 1.25,
P = 0.455, Supplementary material online, Table S7). Results at maximum follow-up are shown in Supplementary material online, Figure
S11 and Tables S6 and S7. Ten-year mortality according to SYNTAX
score tertiles and revascularization strategies in diabetic and nondiabetic patients with 3VD/LMCAD are shown in Supplementary material online, Figures S12 and S13.

Impact of residual SYNTAX score
The rSS was available in 890 (98.6%) patients in the PCI cohort and

diabetic patients in the sub-categories of rSS = 0, >0 to 4, >4 to 8,
and >8 group were 20.5%, 26.6%, 26.3%, and 37.3%, respectively
(P < 0.001). The risk of mortality at 10 years was significantly higher
with an rSS > 8 compared with an rSS <_ 8, for both diabetic (61.2%
vs. 28.7%, P < 0.001) and non-diabetic patients (43.8% vs. 22.8%,
P < 0.001, Supplementary material online, Figure S14).

Impact of type of revascularization
(single or multiple arterial bypass grafts)
In patients with diabetes, there was no significant difference in allcause death at 10 years between patients receiving a single (SAG) or
multiple arterial bypass graft (MAG) or PCI (P = 0.432, Supplementary material online, Figure S15).
Among patients with diabetes, there were no significant
treatment-by-subgroup interactions for C-reactive protein or optimal medical therapy for mortality at 10 years (Figure 3).

and non-diabetic patients (Supplementary material online, Figure
S16). Figure 4C shows that for both diabetics (red curves) and nondiabetics (blue curves), the absolute risk difference in mortality
(treatment benefit of CABG over PCI) curves was not only well-calibrated, but also largely overlapped in the same range of predicted
and observed mortality. Additionally, Figure 4A and B displays the absolute risk differences in mortality for each quarter of the diabetic
and non-diabetic population together with their respective Kaplan-
Meier curves.
Figure 4D shows ranked individual differences (n = 452) in predicted mortalities for diabetic patients undergoing either PCI (blue
solid line) or CABG (red solid line). Actually, 338 patients have higher
predicted mortality after PCI than after CABG, then in the ranking
order a crossover point in predicted mortalities (equipoise) is
reached: beyond that point, the predicted mortality following PCI of
the remaining patients (n = 114) becomes lower than the predicted
mortality after CABG.
The dashed line in Figure 4D depicts in a spline regression (LOESS),
the observed mortality either after PCI or CABG. Notably, the
dashed lines depicting the observed mortalities following either PCI
or CABG crossover around the 200th ranked patient suggesting an
equipoised vital prognosis after either PCI or CABG for that specific
patient. The remaining 252 patients had higher observed mortality
after surgery compared with PCI. In contrast to the neutral 'average
treatment effect' observed in diabetics at 10 years with either CABG

Discussion
The present study was a pre-specified subgroup analysis of the
SYNTAXES study, in which we assessed all-cause death at 10 years
after PCI with first-generation DES vs. CABG as a function of
pharmacologically treated diabetes, with or without insulin
(Graphical abstract). The main findings are:
(1)

(2)

(3)

The treatment effects of PCI vs. CABG on all-cause death at 10
years were similar irrespective of the presence of diabetes. In this
limited sample size with restricted power, insulin-treated patients
undergoing PCI had a numerically higher mortality compared with
those undergoing CABG.
Compared with non-diabetics, pharmacologically treated diabetics
had a higher risk of all-cause death at 10 years after PCI or CABG,
with poorer outcomes amongst insulin vs. non-insulin-treated
patients. After adjustment for baseline confounders, pharmacologically treated and insulin-treated diabetes were both independent
predictors of 10-year mortality.
There was a U-shaped relationship between HbA1c and all-cause
death at 10 years in the overall population and the PCI arm, whereas a linear relationship was observed in the CABG arm.

10-year mortality in patients with diabetes in the SYNTAX Extended Survival Study

(4)

(6)

Previous studies have been unable to conclusively establish
whether PCI or CABG offers the best long-term survival for patients
with diabetes and multivessel CAD. The BARI trial was the first to report a significant 10-year survival benefit with CABG over PCI with
balloon angioplasty amongst 353 diabetic patients with multivessel
CAD, however, the benefit diminished somewhat overextended follow-up.8 In the FREEDOM study, the benefit with CABG over PCI
for all-cause death at 5 years was only marginally significant
(P = 0.049),4 however, considering that the trial was not powered for
all-cause death, this result could be considered hypothesis-generating.15 In the FREEDOM Follow-On study,16 which extended followup in 943 of the original 1900 patients cohort, the estimated rate of
mortality at 8 years was 23.7% and 18.7% in the PCI-DES and CABG
group, respectively (unadjusted HR: 1.32, 95% CI: 0.97, 1.78,
P = 0.076), with the HR remaining unchanged after adjustment.
The greatest variance with our results, which showed no significant
difference between PCI and CABG at 10 years amongst diabetics
with multivessel CAD, comes from a recent propensity score matching analysis by Tam et al.,17 which reported significantly higher mortality with PCI compared with CABG at 8 years. These conflicting
results may be explained by the differences between the trials
designs. First, the study cohorts were different as Tam et al included
patients with two-vessel disease or 3VD, whereas our study only
included patients with 3VD and/or LMCAD. Secondly, they included
patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), while only patients
with stable CAD and unstable angina were included in SYNTAXES.
Moreover, 22.9% of their patients received bare-metal stents. Finally,
the proportion of incomplete revascularization in the PCI arm was
higher in their study, which may partly contribute to the higher incidence of all-cause death in their PCI arm.18-20 In fact, after the exclusion of patients with ACS and those treated with bare-metal stents,
Kaplan-Meier curves between PCI and CABG appear to converge,
especially after 8 years, suggesting a diminishing treatment difference
between PCI and CABG with very long-term follow-up.
At the time of the 5 years report of the SYNTAX study,12 investigators, surgeons, and interventionists were intuitively convinced that
the diverging Kaplan-Meier curves for mortality would keep diverging; however, it now appears that our intuitive assumption was somewhat naive and partially incorrect. Our landmark analysis showed
that after 5 years the Kaplan-Meier survival curve was worse after
CABG than PCI, although the differences were not statistically significant (Figure 2A). These results suggest that a temporal change in the
survival benefit of CABG over PCI in diabetic patients. Notably, within the confines of our limited sample size that may not have adequate

power, further research in adequately powered long-term studies
are required.
In insulin-treated diabetics, PCI resulted in a numerically higher
non-significant mortality at 10 years compared with CABG; however,
no significant interaction was established within the limitations of our
sample size. Similar results in all-cause death were reported in the
insulin-treated diabetic subgroup from the FREEDOM study (PCI vs.
CABG: 19% vs. 14.1%, HR: 1.19, 95% CI: 0.76, 1.85, P-interaction =
0.64),21 indicating that even their sample size of 1850 was too small
to detect a differential treatment survival benefit with CABG over
PCI between diabetics treated with or without insulin. Patients with
insulin-treated diabetes appear to have a longer life expectancy following CABG compared with PCI, although the differences were not
statistically significant (8.24 vs. 7.55 years, P = 0.230) due to limited
sample size (n = 182) and restricted power. This reaffirms the need
for large sample size investigations in this subset of patients.
In the BARI trial, 10-year survival among diabetic patients was
higher following CABG with arterial grafting, compared with CABG
using only vein grafts and PCI.8 However, in our study, no significant
difference in all-cause death at 10 years was observed between
patients with diabetes receiving PCI or either single or multiple arterial grafts (Supplementary material online, Figure S15). These results
support our main findings that the survival benefit of CABG over PCI
subsides over time (10 years); nevertheless, the convergence of the
three survival curves (PCI, CABG with SAG or MAG) is striking. It is
also remarkable that the survival curves in the non-diabetic cohort
kept diverging over time, at least between patients with MAG and
those either treated with PCI, or a combination of SAG and venous
grafts. As a matter of fact, this observation is more worrisome than
the one made in diabetic patients.
It could be argued that the convergence of Kaplan-Meier curves at
10 years is due to ageing; however, no significant interaction on mortality at 10 years was seen between revascularization mode and age
(>70 or <_70 years old) in patients with and without diabetes. In the
entire population of SYNTAXES, a similar lack of significant interaction for age was also reported. Hence the convergence of the two
Kaplan-Meier curves at 10 years cannot be solely explained by ageing. This observation could also be attributed to the late attrition of
bypass grafts around the 7th year of follow-up affecting both SAG
and MAG patients (Supplementary material online, Figure S15); however, only the attrition of venous grafts has been widely documented
in the literature.22
The relationship between HbA1c and mortality following PCI23,24
or CABG25,26 is controversial. Currently, several guidelines recommend the assessment of HbA1c to help achieve better clinical outcomes; however, the threshold for implementing more stringent
glycaemic control varies substantially.27 In the present analysis, a Ushaped relationship between HbA1c and mortality at 10 years was
observed with PCI, whereas the relationship was linear with CABG.
These results suggest that a threshold HbAc1 exists beyond which it
should be prognostically unacceptable to treat patients with PCI.
Unfortunately, our limited sample size did not permit any strong statistical inference or formal recommendations. High-quality randomized large-scale trials are needed to further investigate this important
issue.
Prior studies established that CABG was preferred for those with
intermediate or high SYNTAX scores.5,7,28 Notably, an observation

Amongst diabetics, there were no significant differences in all-cause
death at 10 years between PCI and CABG in any anatomical
SYNTAX score tertile.
In patients with diabetes and 3VD, the overall risk of mortality at 10
years was comparable between PCI and CABG; however, it was numerically higher with PCI in the highest (>_33) SYNTAX score
tertile.
The SYNTAX score II 2020 further endorses our general contention that-as an 'average treatment effect'-differences in all-cause
death between CABG and PCI in diabetic patients at 10 years are
minor, whereas individualized predicted and observed mortality
clearly identify individuals who benefit either from CABG or PCI.

..
.. if it is unlikely that complete or nearly complete revascularization
.. (rSS <_ 8) can be achieved, then CABG should be considered.
..
To further endorse our contention that treatment differences in vital
..
.. prognosis between diabetic and non-diabetic patients at 10 years are
..
.. not major, we applied the SYNTAX score II 2020 to the diabetic and
.. non-diabetic population. We found that the ability of the SYNTAX
..
.. score II 2020 to predict rates of all-cause death at 10 years following
.. PCI or CABG was equally valuable in diabetic and non-diabetic patients.
..
.. This is not surprising since the score is derived from the outcomes of
.. SYNTAXES, but its applicability and accuracy in diabetics, as well as in
..
.. non-diabetics, is a form of internal validation. Therefore, the SYNTAX
.. score II 2020 has the capability to support revascularization decision..
.. making in diabetic and non-diabetic patients with 3VD and/or LMCAD.
.. However, we have to acknowledge that due to the limited sample size,
..
.. the confidence intervals of the absolute risk difference for each quarter
.. in the diabetic population are wide (Figure 4).
..
..
Although there is equipoise in mortality between diabetics in
.. SYNTAXES treated with PCI and CABG, and theoretically they may
..
.. seem equally eligible to receive either treatment, the present analysis
.. reflects an 'average treatment effect' based on a singled out comor..
.. bidity, namely diabetes. Nowadays, precision medicine tries to
..
.. individualize the prognosis of patients taking into account multiple
.. co-variables.34 In the SYNTAX score II 2020,13 diabetes is included as
..
.. one of the prognostic indexes predicting the risk of all-cause death at
.. 10 years that is also affected by so-called effect-modifiers (e.g. ana..
.. tomical SYNTAX score and type of disease: 3VD or LMCAD). The
.. endpoint in SYNTAXES was all-cause death only, and in the absence
..
.. of data collection of MACCE in the last 5 years of follow-up, caution
.. must be exerted about a simplistic interpretation on the equipoise of
..
.. mortality. Although all-cause death may for the trialist be the ultimate
.. unbiased comparative assessment between two revascularization
..
.. approaches,35 from the patient's viewpoint MACE and quality.. adjusted life years (QUALY) are also very relevant outcomes.36
..
..
.. Limitations
..
.. Although the diabetes subgroup was pre-specified and randomization
.. was stratified by the presence of diabetes,11 the present analyses did
..
.. not have adequate statistical power and subgroup analyses may in.. crease the risk of Type 1 and 2 errors. There was no formal correc..
.. tion for multiple testing for subgroup analyses of the trial, taking into
.. account the post hoc nature of the analysis.37 The sophistication and
..
.. number of the analysis may lead to the likelihood of spurious findings,
..
.. and all reported findings should be considered strictly as exploratory
.. and hypothesis-generating. To improve statistical efficiency/power,
..
.. we performed a multivariable analysis in the present study; however,
.. the inability to include all relevant confounders may cause bias that
..
.. cannot be adjusted. Additionally, the SYNTAX trial enrolled patients

from the FREEDOM trial was that when CABG is compared with
PCI, diabetic status was more determinant of outcomes and vital
prognosis, than the extent and complexity of CAD.29 Our results
suggest that the anatomical SYNTAX score is not a determinant factor of fatal prognosis in diabetic patients in the SYNTAX study; however, following multivariable adjustment, it was associated with an
increased risk of death in patients who received PCI, but not CABG
(Supplementary material online, Table S2).
The anatomical SYNTAX score as well as the type of CAD (3VD
or LMCAD) are 'modifiers', as labelled by epidemiologists, that have
a profound interaction with other clinical characteristics and comorbidities, and deserve to be computed and incorporated into the calculation of the SYNTAX score II 2020.13 Therefore, if the anatomical
SYNTAX score was not integrated into the SYNTAX score II 2020,
and just interpreted in isolation, it would have no prognostic value
for the Heart Team when deciding the optimal revascularization
strategy of diabetic patients with complex CAD. In patients with diabetes and 3VD, the current guidelines recommend that PCI may be
considered in patients with a SYNTAX score <_22 (recommendation
IIb for PCI), however, it is not recommended in patients with a
SYNTAX score >22 (recommendation III).30
Our landmark analysis showed that in diabetic patients with 3VD,
PCI compared with CABG had higher all-cause death at 5 years, with
a reverse risk seen between 5 and 10 years. These 5-year results
were in line with previous studies6; however, the survival benefit
from CABG was seen to diminish between 5 and 10 years. In patients
with diabetes and 3VD, PCI appeared to have a non-significant higher
risk of all-cause death at 10 years compared with CABG. Consistent
with a prior meta-analysis reporting survival up to 5 years,6 no significant between-group (PCI vs. CABG) difference in mortality at 5 years
was observed in diabetics with LMCAD, with this absence of difference in vital outcome maintained up to 10 years and beyond
(Supplementary material online, Figures S10B and S11B). Notably,
with the limited sample size, these subgroup analyses may reduce the
power of the analysis and increase the risk of Type 1 and 2 errors.
In non-diabetic patients with 3VD, we observed a higher risk of
mortality with PCI over CABG at 5 years, which is inconsistent with
the aforementioned meta-analysis.6 This finding could be due to a
play of chance related to the smaller sample size than the pooled patient-level analysis. It could also be due to disparity in follow-up durations, which were a median of 3.8 years in the meta-analysis and
11.2 years in SYNTAXES. Moreover, in the meta-analysis, only 60%
of patients had 3VD, unlike the current subgroup analysis where all
patients had 3VD. Furthermore, the higher mortality at 10 years with
PCI in non-diabetics with 3VD was mainly driven by patients with a
SYNTAX score >_33 (Supplementary material online, Figure S13A).
An rSS > 8 has been associated with increased short- and midterm adverse events, including all-cause death.31,32 Recently, an observational study found that diabetes and an rSS > 8 contribute independently to late outcomes in STEMI patients with a follow-up of
3.6 years.33 In our analysis, compared with patients with rSS <_ 8,
patients with rSS > 8 had a significantly higher all-cause death at
10 years both in diabetic and non-diabetic patients. These results
were in line with the 5-year results in the SYNTAX trial.32 Residual
SYNTAX score is a post-procedural parameter, and therefore it is
difficult to determine the specific risk and outcome a priori; however,

10-year mortality in patients with diabetes in the SYNTAX Extended Survival Study

Conclusions
Diabetes was associated with an increased risk of all-cause death at
10 years in patients with 3VD and/or LMCAD who underwent either
PCI or CABG. In diabetic patients with complex CAD, CABG did
not lower the risk of all-cause death at 10 years compared with PCI,
although diabetic patients on insulin may derive a survival benefit
from CABG. The SYNTAX score II 2020 may identify diabetic
patients who will benefit from either CABG or PCI.

be affected by ascertainment bias.38 In the SYNTAXES study, only
one measurement of HbA1c was available at enrolment, which cannot accurately reflect prior control of diabetes. Nevertheless, it is remarkable that this single measurement still has a long-term
prognostic value. In future studies with larger sample sizes, multiple
measurements of HbA1c should be recommended.
Since loss to follow-up may have potentially impacted on estimated
treatment effects, it should be acknowledged that vital status was missing in 6% of patients. However, the drop-out rate was comparable between PCI and CABG. Notably, a previous systematic review that
included trials published in five top general medical journals found that
the median loss to follow-up was also 6% in 191 trials.39 Another limitation is that the diagnostic criteria of diabetes in the SYNTAX trial
(2005-07) did not include HbA1c, which was only adopted by ADA in
2010.40 Finally, in the SYNTAX study, patients received PCI with firstgeneration DES, which are no longer commercially available, hence,
our results are only partially applicable to contemporary newgeneration DES. Obviously, patients did not benefit from new-generation anti-diabetic drugs such as GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT2
inhibitors or inhibitors of PCSK 9 which have all been shown to lower
the risks of cardiovascular mortality.41-44 Although the very long-term
data from SYNTAXES are important, we have to emphasize that they
are not fully applicable to today's patients, and the Task Force drawing
future Guidelines should be warned to avoid strict recommendations
with legal implications based only on 'old' data, because they are the
only data available. Further investigations in dedicated large-scale trials
in patients with diabetes on contemporary pharmacologic therapeutic
regimens are warranted. However, it is unavoidable that the findings
from long-term follow-up data are based on outdated technology,
while the evidence for contemporary technology can be derived from
studies with only short-term follow-up.
