Aims

The International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness with Medical and Invasive Approaches (ISCHEMIA)
trial prespecified an analysis to determine whether accounting for recurrent cardiovascular events in addition to
first events modified understanding of the treatment effects.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
Patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) and moderate or severe ischaemia on stress testing were
and results
randomized to either initial invasive (INV) or initial conservative (CON) management. The primary outcome was a

composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction (MI), and hospitalization for unstable angina, heart failure,
or cardiac arrest. The Ghosh-Lin method was used to estimate mean cumulative incidence of total events with
death as a competing risk. The 5179 ISCHEMIA patients experienced 670 index events (318 INV, 352 CON) and
203 recurrent events (102 INV, 101 CON). A single primary event was observed in 9.8% of INV and 10.8% of
CON patients while >_2 primary events were observed in 2.5% and 2.8%, respectively. Patients with recurrent
events were older; had more frequent hypertension, diabetes, prior MI, or cerebrovascular disease; and had more
multivessel CAD. The average number of primary endpoint events per 100 patients over 4 years was 18.2 in INV
[95% confidence interval (CI) 15.8-20.9] and 19.7 in CON (95% CI 17.5-22.2), difference -1.5 (95% CI -5.0 to 2.0,
P = 0.398). Comparable results were obtained when all-cause death was substituted for cardiovascular death and
when stroke was added as an event.

Introduction
Most large cardiovascular trials are interpreted based on treatmentinduced differences in the time from randomization to a primary
composite endpoint, which is typically comprised of several different
types of adverse events (mortality, morbidity, hospitalizations).1 This
approach counts the first event experienced as signifying the failure
of treatment for that patient and therefore intentionally ignores all
subsequent events. However, the life course of patients with chronic
cardiovascular disease is much more complex than this analysis strategy implies and is often characterized by long periods of disease stability interrupted by repeated episodes of disease progression of
varying phenotypes. Recurrent episodes of disease activity can be at
least as consequential for patients and for the health system as primary events, with effects on longevity, quality of life, and total cost of
care. The prevalent practice of routinely regarding recurrent event
information as unnecessary for an adequate understanding of treatment strategies is primarily pragmatic, rather than scientific or clinical.
The statistical methods for analysing time-to-first event are very well

established, whereas the methods for analysing total events are still
evolving and no consensus on a comprehensive and fully satisfactory
assessment has emerged.2,3
A number of trials of drug therapy in patients with coronary artery
disease (CAD) have reported treatment benefits on recurrent events
that equalled or exceeded the effects on first events.4-10 These pharmacological interventions are presumed to produce their treatment benefits by reducing atherosclerotic disease progression and favourably
altering plaque pathobiology. Coronary revascularization offers a very
different mechanism of benefit from medical therapies that reduce the
risk of clinical events. Whether improving coronary blood flow with
coronary stenting or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery
might alter the likelihood of repeat events in the setting of modern
guideline-directed medical therapy is not clear. In the recently completed International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness with
Medical and Invasive Approaches (ISCHEMIA), stable CAD patients
with moderate or severe myocardial ischaemia were randomized to an
initial invasive (INV) or conservative (CON) strategy, with angiography
reserved for failure of medical therapy.11 As part of the ISCHEMIA

research program, we report a prespecified examination of the impact
of INV vs. CON on recurrent events and total events.

Methods
Study design and population

Trial endpoints
The five-item primary composite endpoint comprised cardiovascular
death, myocardial infarction (MI), and hospitalization for unstable angina,
heart failure, or resuscitated cardiac arrest. Secondary endpoints included
the composite of cardiovascular death or MI; the six-item composite of
cardiovascular death, MI, and hospitalization for unstable angina, heart failure, cardiac arrest, or stroke; and a six-item composite with all-cause
death, MI, and hospitalization for unstable angina, heart failure, cardiac arrest, or stroke. Non-procedural infarction was defined based on the
Third Universal Definition of MI types 1, 2, 4b, and 4c.13 Procedural
infarctions were defined with higher biomarker thresholds than have
been previously published.11 All components of the primary endpoint
were adjudicated by an independent clinical events committee whose
members were masked to treatment group assignment. For the purposes
of the present analysis, when two or more non-fatal events were
recorded on the case report form followed by death, each event was
counted separately regardless of time between events.

Previously reported trial primary results
As reported previously, a primary outcome event occurred in 318 INV
patients and 352 CON patients [time to primary outcome event adjusted
hazard ratio (HR) by intention to treat 0.93; 95% confidence interval (CI)
0.80-1.08, P = 0.34].11 The primary outcome Kaplan-Meier curves
crossed at 2.5 years; thus, the proportional hazards assumption of the
Cox model was not met and additional comparisons were performed to
clarify the time-varying treatment differences. At 6 months, the cumulative primary event rate was 5.3% for INV and 3.4% for CON (difference
1.9%; 95% CI 0.8-3.0%). At 5 years, the cumulative primary event rate
was 16.4% for INV and 18.2% for CON (difference -1.8%; 95% CI -4.7%
to 1.0%). For the secondary endpoint of cardiovascular death or MI, there
were 276 events in INV and 314 in CON. All-cause death occurred in
145 INV and 144 CON patients (HR 1.05; 95% CI 0.83-1.32).

Data analysis overview and statistical
methods
For descriptive purposes, patients were classified according to the number
of primary outcome events experienced (none, one, two or more) and
baseline characteristics were examined, including patient demographics,
select medical history, medication use, and CCTA findings. Categorical variables are presented as counts (percentages), and continuous variables are
presented as median (25th percentile, 75th percentile). The purpose of

this exploratory analysis was to identify whether the multiple event
patients had clinically distinctive phenotypic differences from single event
and no event patients. Missing data were excluded from all denominators.
Given the lack of clear consensus regarding the best analytical approach to use in analysing multiple/recurrent time-dependent outcome
events, we originally planned (before unblinding of the ISCHEMIA results)
to employ several related methods based on the Cox model, each requiring different assumptions, with the intention of looking for concordance
of results and treating the Andersen-Gill model as the reference case.
However, when the primary ISCHEMIA analysis showed the proportional hazards assumption underlying the use of the Cox model was not met
for the primary outcome, we altered our analysis plan to use the Ghosh-
Lin cumulative incidence estimation approach as the reference case, with
the Cox model approaches as supplemental14 (Supplementary material
online, Table S1). The Ghosh-Lin method is related to statistical methods
used to estimate the cumulative probability of developing an event of
interest by a certain time in follow-up. Standard 'cumulative incidence'
methods, however, consider only first events and ignore all subsequent
events. Ghosh and Lin14 proposed a modification of the cumulative incidence methods that incorporates recurrent events while also accounting
for death as a terminating (informative censoring) event. Their method,
which does not require any parametric (i.e. distributional) assumptions,
estimates the (marginal) mean cumulative number of events (first and recurrent) over time from randomization in each treatment group while
accounting for the fact that patients who die cannot contribute any
events after their death date. This is accomplished by keeping the patients
who die in the risk set beyond their time of death but fixing their event
rate after death to be zero. No assumptions are required about the relationship between recurrent events in the same patients. Using this approach, we estimated the cumulative average number of clinical primary
endpoint events (first and recurrent) per 100 patients over a 4-year time
horizon in the presence of a death by time t. These estimates were produced for the primary composite outcome event and each of the composite secondary endpoints described earlier.
The Andersen-Gill model is the method used most frequently to examine treatment differences in recurrent and total events.15 This model is a
generalization of the Cox model that models gap time (i.e. time from previous event to next event or from trial entry to first event if no previous
event). Each subject contributes to the risk set for an event as long as she
or he is under observation. The model assumes that every event is independent of every other event and that the order of events is not important.
Because the Andersen-Gill model assumes that multiple events from an individual patient are independent (equivalent to each event being recorded
from a different patient), which is clinically implausible, robust estimation is
used to account for the correlation of events that occurs when individual
patients contribute more than one event to the analysis.16 The effects of
the randomized treatment strategy on total clinical events were summarized using the HR and corresponding 95% CI and P-value. Model adjustment covariables included age, sex, randomized treatment strategy,
estimated glomerular filtration rate, ejection fraction, and diabetes.
The Wei-Lin-Weissfeld17 model is a stratified marginal Cox model,
where the strata are defined by the number of events possible (up to three
for the current analysis), and event time for each event is counted from the
time of randomization (marginal approach). The objective of this model is
to estimate the treatment effect on outcome (HR) for the first, second, and
third events. This allows for examination of the possibility that the treatment effect size differs importantly for initial vs. recurrent events. All
patients are included in the risk set for each event, regardless of their event
history.18 Like Anderson-Gill, this method assumes independence of events
(first vs. second vs. third) when estimating model coefficients and uses robust standard errors to account for event interrelationships.

The study design and main results of the international ISCHEMIA trial
have been published previously.11,12 A total of 5179 stable patients with
moderate or severe myocardial ischaemia were randomly assigned to an
initial INV therapy with catheterization, angiography, and revascularization, if feasible, plus optimal medical therapy or to optimal medical therapy alone with cardiac catheterization reserved for patients in whom
medical therapy failed. An initial coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) study (with results blinded to site investigators) was performed at baseline in 3783 (73%) patients and was used to rule out
significant left main disease and non-obstructive CAD. The median
follow-up was 3.2 years.

Effects of initial INV vs. CON treatment strategies

Forest plots were used to summarize Cox model-based results. Given
that the proportional hazards assumption was not met for the primary
ISCHEMIA intention-to-treat analysis, HRs are best understood as a
weighted average of all the (time-varying) HRs over available followup.19,20 Neither the Andersen-Gill model nor the Wei-Lin-Weissfeld
model distinguish between censoring and terminating events and both
therefore ignore the potential complexities created by competing risks.21
Analyses were performed using SAS software (version 9.4) and R (version 3.5.3).

The ISCHEMIA trial was supported by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood
Institute with supplemental support from industry as reported previously.11
The trial protocol was approved by institutional review boards or ethics
committees at New York University Grossman School of Medicine, the
Duke Clinical Research Institute, and at each participating clinical site. Every
patient provided written informed consent to participate in the trial.

Results
Baseline characteristics of patients with
and without recurrent primary endpoint
events
Of the 5179 patients randomized in ISCHEMIA, 4509 (87.1%) had
none of the events included in the primary composite endpoint (cardiovascular death, MI, or hospitalization for unstable angina, heart failure, or resuscitated cardiac arrest), and 670 (12.9%) patients had one
or more events: 533 (10.3%) had a single event and 137 (2.6%) had
two or more events (Table 1).
The median age was lowest in the patients without an event
(64 years) and highest in patients with 2 or more events (69 years).
No consistent trend was present for sex (Table 1). The prevalence of
hypertension and diabetes was higher in patients with recurrent
events: hypertension was present in 71.7% of patients with no events
and 89.8% of patients with 2 or more events; diabetes was present in
40.7% of patients with no events and 61.3% of patients with multiple
events. Multiple event patients had a higher prevalence of peripheral
vascular or cerebrovascular disease and a higher prevalence of prior
CABG surgery (Table 1).
Patients with recurrent events also had a higher prevalence of multivessel disease (92.3%) determined by baseline CCTA relative to
patients with 1 event (86.5%) or no events (77.9%). No consistent
pattern was evident in the results of the qualifying stress test (data
not shown). Patients with multiple events did not have more frequent
or severe angina at trial entry relative to patients with a single event
or with no events (Table 1).

Primary endpoint event distribution by
treatment group
There were 873 primary endpoint events, with 670 occurring as
index events (318 INV, 352 CON) and 203 as recurrent events (102
INV, 101 CON). The distribution of no, single, and two or more
events did not differ by randomized treatment assignment: 9.8% of
INV and 10.8% of CON had one event while 2.5% and 2.8%, respectively, had two or more events (Table 2). These findings did not depend on which primary events or combination of events the patients

experienced except in the case of hospitalization for heart failure and
for unstable angina. Patients in the INV arm had more hospitalizations
for heart failure (one event: INV, 1.7% and CON, 0.7%; two or more
events: INV, 0.3% and CON, 0.2%) and fewer hospitalizations for unstable angina (one event: INV, 0.6% and CON 1.1%; two or more
events: INV, 0.0% and CON, 0.1%) (Table 2).

Cumulative incidence of events by
treatment
The average number of primary endpoint events over 4 years was similar between patients randomized to the INV and CON strategies
(Table 3). Specifically, the average number of events per 100 patients
over 4 years was 18.2 (95% CI 15.8-20.9) among those randomized to
INV and 19.7 (95% CI 17.5-22.2) among those randomized to CON
[difference: -1.5 (95% CI -5.0 to 2.0), P = 0.398] (Table 3 and Figure 1).
Comparable results were observed when the primary composite
endpoint was varied to include all-cause death instead of cardiovascular death and to include stroke events (Table 3, Figure 2, and
Supplementary material online, Figures S1 and S2). Similar findings were
obtained for combinations of death and MI (Table 3 and Figure 3).
Examination of repeated non-fatal events of a single type (Table 3 and
Figure 4) showed that the average number of hospitalizations for heart
failure per 100 patients over 4 years in the INV strategy was twice the
average number in the CON strategy [2.6/100 patients vs. 1.3/100
patients, respectively; difference: 1.3 (95% CI 0.2-2.4), P = 0.021]. The
INV arm had a lower average number of hospitalizations for unstable
angina [0.7/100 patients vs. 1.5/100 patients in the CON arm, difference -0.8 (95% CI -1.5 to -0.1); P = 0.020].

Relative treatment effects on recurrent
events
Using the Andersen-Gill model to examine the effect of treatment on
recurrent events, the adjusted INV: CON HR for the primary composite event was 0.95 (95% CI 0.83-1.09; P = 0.468) (Supplementary material online, Table S2 and Figure S3). Varying the composition of the
composite endpoints did not materially alter the results. For single
event types, hospitalization for heart failure was twice as likely for INV
[HR 2.02 (95% CI 1.32-3.09); P = 0.001] and hospitalization for unstable angina was reduced by about half [HR 0.48 (95% CI 0.27-0.86);
P = 0.014] (Supplementary material online, Table S2).
Using the Wei-Lin-Weissfeld model to compare the effects of
treatment on recurrent events stratified by event sequence number
(first, second, or third event) provided an average HR of 0.93 (95% CI
0.78-1.08; P = 0.332) with no consequential differences according to
whether the event was the first or a recurrent event (Supplementary
material online, Table S3 and Figure S4).
Among the 540 ISCHEMIA patients with a qualifying (i.e. non-fatal)
first event who were at risk for recurrent events (261 patients INV,
279 patients CON), the majority (80%) of initial events were MIs
(Supplementary material online, Table S4A). After the first event,
37.8% of patients had a revascularization procedure [percutaneous
coronary intervention (PCI) or CABG]: 28.4% of INV at a median of
12 days and 46.6% of CON at a median of 11 days (Supplementary
materialonline, Table S4B ). Second events were equally balanced in
frequency between deaths and MIs and did not differ between the

treatment groups (Supplementary material online, Table S4C). The
median time to death was short (9 days INV, 11 days CON) while the
median time to recurrent MI was 101 days for INV and 203 days for
CON. Procedure-related MIs were infrequent as repeat events (two
events INV, three events CON).
A total of 26 second primary endpoint events occurred in the 7day period following the first event. Death accounted for 22 (84.6%;
10 INV, 12 CON) of the events. The remaining four events consisted
of two hospitalizations for cardiac arrest (7.7%, INV), one MI (3.9%,
CON), and one hospitalization for heart failure (3.9%, INV).

Discussion
Two findings of our analysis deserve special emphasis. First, recurrent
primary endpoint events were quite infrequent in the stable CAD
patients enrolled in ISCHEMIA despite the fact that they had objective evidence of moderate or severe ischaemia at trial entry. Second,
evaluation of treatment assignment on total events rather than first
events did not substantively alter the patterns of treatment-related
differences from that reported for the primary endpoint analysis of
ISCHEMIA11 (Graphical abstract).

on estimated treatment effects. Therapies that affect atherosclerotic
plaque biology or stability appear to have effects that are the same on
first and recurrent events, which seems consistent with our general
understanding of how these therapies provide benefit.4-10 Whether
such expectations extend to coronary revascularization is less clear.
The INV arm in ISCHEMIA, as previously reported, reduced spontaneous MI rates progressively over time relative to the CON arm.11
Whether that pattern will continue and will result in a late-emerging
mortality difference is being assessed in the ongoing ISCHEMIA longterm follow-up study. Thus, an invasive management strategy complicated by a subsequent spontaneous MI may not provide any protective
prognostic benefits over a CON-medical strategy. Also, noteworthy is
the finding that very few of the second event MIs were procedure
related (Table 2).
In the ISCHEMIA prespecified covariate-adjusted time to primary
event Cox model-based analysis, the invasive: CON HR was 0.93
(95% CI 0.80-1.08, P = 0.34).11 Cox model-based analysis of recurrent and total events in the present analysis were almost identical
with these results: for the Andersen-Gill model HR 0.95 (95% CI
0.83-1.09, P = 0.47); Wei-Lin-Weissfeld model HR 0.93 (95% CI
0.78-1.08, P = 0.33). Since the proportional hazards assumption of
the Cox model was not consistent with observed treatment-related
data patterns, cumulative event rates were also estimated. As
reported previously, at 6 months, the INV arm had an estimated cumulative primary (first) event rate of 5.3% vs. 3.4% for CON (difference of 1.9%).11 At 5 years, the INV had an estimated cumulative
(first) event rate of 16.4% vs. 18.2% for CON with a difference of
-1.8%. In the present analysis, the estimated cumulative total mean

and found a high degree of consistency in the resulting treatment effect estimates. Thus, this report adds important new evidence to the
ISCHEMIA primary publication that from a clinical events perspective, the two strategies tested provide equivalent outcomes for at
least the first 4 years after randomization.

Importance of guideline-directed medical therapy
Secondary prevention was a core component of the treatment regimen provided to all ISCHEMIA patients, regardless of treatment assignment.12 In prior work, prognostically effective medical therapies
have been found to reduce repeat events at least as effectively as
they reduce initial events.4-10 What remains less clear is to what extent recurrent events that occur in the presence of guidelinedirected medical therapy reflect either a lack of sufficient therapeutic
intensity or a resistance to pharmacological therapy that cannot be
overcome even at target doses. Since medical therapy intensity was
not randomized in ISCHEMIA, we cannot distinguish these possibilities in the context of an intention-to-treat comparison.

Limitations
Several caveats should be considered in the interpretation of this report. First, as discussed above, of the 670 ISCHEMIA patients with at
least one primary outcome event, only 20% had a repeat event. Five

event types were included in the primary composite endpoint, some of
which were very infrequent. Thus, even in this very large trial of CAD
patients with moderate or severe ischaemia, our ability to identify all
the relevant different patterns of recurrent events by treatment and
according to specific event type with high precision was limited.
Second, combining the five different components of the primary
ISCHEMIA composite event as a construct for analysis ignores the
clear differences in importance that these events have for patients.
Deaths, MIs, and hospitalizations carry very different implications for
the patient and the healthcare system. Composite multicomponent
endpoints have become increasingly common as primary outcomes
for large clinical trials primarily because powering trials of chronic disease therapies to detect a mortality difference alone is often quite infeasible. In conjunction with the present recurrent events/total
events analysis, the ISCHEMIA trial has prespecified a future analysis
to examine the importance of differential weighting of different types
of outcome events to the interpretation of the trial. These two investigations together, as well as the quality of life data reported by
Spertus et al.,25 should comprehensively describe the effect of the
two ISCHEMIA treatment strategies on patient disease burden.
Third, since there is no single statistical analysis method that captures all the important aspects of recurrent event patterns without
making problematic assumptions, we used several complementary
methods to describe and compare different aspects of the recurrent

events that occurred in the trial. The concordance of these different
approaches on a conclusion of no net difference by the treatment
group provides important reassurance that our findings are not
biased by a particular choice of analysis methods.
Fourth, ISCHEMIA tested an initial INV management strategy
that comprised a mixture of 74% PCI and 26% CABG among the
patients in this arm who received revascularization. The outcomes
of the trial may have been affected in important ways by the composition of this mixture of PCI and CABG. In the context of stable
ischaemic heart disease with evidence of ischaemia, PCI has not
been shown to alter the probability of death or MI relative to
medical therapy,26,27 but CABG may reduce MI events.28 Since assignment to PCI vs. CABG was not randomized, our data do not
permit us to address whether a higher proportion of CABG use
would have led to more favourable primary treatment effect estimates in ISCHEMIA.
Finally, our results are affected by the length of follow-up available
for analysis, and longer-term follow-up could alter the findings and
conclusions. The ISCHEMIA trial is currently collecting an additional
5 years of follow-up, and our conclusions about the impact of treatment on total events will be re-evaluated as part of that work.

Conclusions
In stable CAD patients with moderate or severe myocardial ischaemia enrolled in the ISCHEMIA trial, recurrent events were infrequent

Figure 3 (A) Cumulative average number of cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction endpoints by treatment. Plots of the mean frequency
function of the composite endpoint of cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction vs. time, stratified by randomized treatment strategy (Ghosh-Lin
method). The grey-shaded region of the plot indicates regions where the null hypothesis of no difference between the curves can be rejected based
on the 95% confidence interval for the difference. In other words, if the shading overlaps the two treatment curves, it is indicative of no significant difference. (B) Cumulative average number of all-cause death or myocardial infarction endpoints by treatment. Plots of the mean frequency function of
the composite endpoint of all-cause death or myocardial infarction vs. time, stratified by randomized treatment strategy (Ghosh-Lin method). The
grey-shaded region of the plot indicates regions where the null hypothesis of no difference between the curves can be rejected based on the 95% confidence interval for the difference. In other words, if the shading overlaps the two treatment curves, it is indicative of no significant difference. CON,
conservative; INV, invasive; MI, myocardial infarction.
