Aims

The aim of this study was to investigate the causal relationship and evidence of an association between increased
adiposity and the risk of incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) events or mortality.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
Observational (informing association) and Mendelian randomization (MR) (informing causality) studies were
assessed to gather mutually complementary insights and elucidate perplexing epidemiological relationships.
and results

Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational and MR studies that were published until January 2021 and
evaluated the association between obesity-related indices and CVD risk were searched. Twelve systematic reviews
with 53 meta-analyses results (including over 501 cohort studies) and 12 MR studies were included in the analysis.
A body mass index (BMI) increase was associated with higher risks of coronary heart disease, heart failure, atrial
fibrillation, all-cause stroke, haemorrhagic stroke, ischaemic stroke, hypertension, aortic valve stenosis, pulmonary
embolism, and venous thrombo-embolism. The MR study results demonstrated a causal effect of obesity on all indices but stroke. The CVD risk increase for every 5 kg/m2 increase in BMI varied from 10% [relative risk (RR) 1.10;
95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-1.21; certainty of evidence, low] for haemorrhagic stroke to 49% (RR 1.49; 95%
CI 1.40-1.60; certainty of evidence, high) for hypertension. The all-cause and CVD-specific mortality risks increased
with adiposity in cohorts, but the MR studies demonstrated no causal effect of adiposity on all-cause mortality.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
High adiposity is associated with increased CVD risk despite divergent evidence gradients. Adiposity was a causal

risk factor for CVD except all-cause mortality and stroke. Half (49%; 26/53) of the associations were supported by
high-level evidence. The associations were consistent between sexes and across global regions. This study provides
guidance on how to integrate evidence from observational (association) and genetics-driven (causation) studies
accumulated to date, to enable a more reliable interpretation of epidemiological relationships.

Introduction
Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) account for over two-thirds of deaths
attributable to a high body mass index (BMI),1 and the consequential
health outcomes constitute a major proportion of health-related
economic burden worldwide.2-6 Despite countermeasures, the outlook is unfavourable, and the incidence of CVD is expected to increase over the next few decades, especially in low- and middleincome countries, as the average BMI increases.7 The association between adiposity and CVD has been extensively studied for decades
using Mendelian randomization (MR)8,9 and observational study
designs.10,11,12 However, the evidence to date has focused on single

clinical associations, leaving evidence on the association between
adiposity and multiple cardiovascular outcomes (e.g. stroke, heart
failure, atrial fibrillation) unconsolidated.
Umbrella reviews have been increasingly conducted to consolidate the highest level of evidence, namely systematic reviews and
meta-analyses, on a given topic.13,14 The most notable difference
between a conventional meta-analysis and an umbrella review is
that the former uses results from the original study as a fundamental unit for analysis, while the latter uses the results of previous
meta-analyses. The umbrella review unites previously published
systematic reviews or meta-analyses that usually examine a single
clinical association (e.g. adiposity and stroke), systematically

Observational studies (informing associations) and Mendelian randomization studies (informing causality) provided mutually complementary insight and
enabled a more reliable interpretation of perplexing epidemiological relationships. This figure was constructed based on the summary of evidence shown
in Table 1.

Methods
Literature search and selection criteria
We systematically searched Google Scholar, PubMed, Embase, and the
Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for systematic reviews and
meta-analyses that investigated the association between adiposity indices
and cardiovascular health outcomes from inception to 28 January 2021.
The adiposity indices of interest included BMI, waist circumference
(WC), and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR). We used a predefined search strategy outlined in the Supplementary material online, Appendix for the initial
search and replicated it using a search strategy developed by an experienced librarian. We also performed extensive manual searches of the reference lists of the retrieved review articles to identify additional studies.
Observational studies were collected to update previous meta-analyses,
while MR studies were incorporated to evaluate causality as described in
previous umbrella reviews.18,19 We imposed no language restrictions, but
all included studies were written in English. The study protocol was published in PROSPERO (CRD42020179469).

Inclusion and exclusion criteria
We included systematic reviews and meta-analyses of prospective cohort
studies as well as MR studies that explored the association between obesity indices and cardiovascular outcomes using genetic instruments (GI).
We excluded systematic reviews and meta-analyses that evaluated indices other than BMI, WC, and WHR, such as weight loss %, history of
bariatric surgery, and adipose tissue volume, as they can increase heterogeneity and hinder a valid synthesis of the results. Studies that included a
specific population, such as patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass graft or patients who had
CVD outcomes of interest [e.g. coronary heart disease (CHD), atrial

.. fibrillation] at baseline were excluded. Studies involving animal or in vitro
..
.. experiments were excluded.

merges them to produce multiple clinical endpoints, and provides a
bird's-eye view of a given topic (e.g. adiposity and several CVD).15,16
This umbrella review process involves extensive statistical replication
and updating of previous meta-analyses using a uniform analytic
model and framework to align and directly compare the relevant information.15 This aspect is a unique strength of the umbrella review
in that it enables the consistent and comparative assessment of multiple biases for all relevant outcomes and allows the stratification of
findings into distinct evidence levels. Therefore, umbrella reviews
help discriminate between mature and immature findings and provide
the highest level of evidence to guide decision-making.15
Given that the association between adiposity and CVD outcomes
is an epidemiological topic, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are
rarely possible, preventing the elucidation of causal inferences. As an
alternative to RCTs, MR studies have been increasingly applied to
strengthen causal inferences about associations in observational research.17 The present study is the first to incorporate MR studies
into the body of evidence of observational studies and construct an
association-to-causality evidence map to aid the more reliable interpretation of epidemiological relationships. This umbrella review accrued a vast amount of relevant evidence on the
association between obesity indices and CVD. The results from
recently published cohort studies were manually incorporated
into existing meta-analyses to update previous results, and over
501 cohorts and 30 million participants were integrated for quantitative syntheses. This work may help contextualize the magnitude of
the association and explain the causality of obesity in CVD.

bias analysis could have been performed, and regional analyses were not
included for evidence classification. We did not conduct subgroup analyses of cohort vs. case-control studies, as all of the included meta-analyses
analysed cohort studies. When multiple effect metrics were reported
from numerous studies, the effects were pooled regardless of the metrics; however, subgroup analyses for each metric were conducted to
evaluate the difference.

Evaluation of the certainty of evidence

map to enable a more reliable interpretation of the epidemiological relationship. We reviewed any discordance between the observational studies and MR analyses (Table 1). We assessed the certainty of evidence for
all reported associations from the observational and MR studies using the
Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation
(GRADE) framework.38
The GRADE framework accounts for study limitations, risk of bias, imprecision, indirectness, inconsistency, publication bias, large magnitude of
effect, and dose-response associations. For the study design in the
GRADE framework, we assigned the high level for MR studies given that
RCTs are rarely possible for non-interventional epidemiological topics
and MR studies are usually deemed as an alternative to RCTs for such

Results
Literature review
Of the 16 112 studies identified in the reviewed databases, 1322
were eligible for title and abstract review. After the exclusion of
1000 studies that met our pre-specified exclusion criteria, 275
systematic reviews with meta-analyses and 47 MR studies were
subjected to full-text review. The full-text review led to the exclusion of 283 further studies; thus, 12 systematic reviews and 53
meta-analyses of over 501 non-overlapping cohort studies and 12
MR studies (25 cohorts) were included in the final analyses. The
PECO (population, exposure, comparison, and outcome) of the
included studies were as follows: meta-analyses investigated the impact of increased adiposity (E) vs. normal condition (C) on the risk of
CVD outcomes (O) in the general population (P). The search and selection processes are presented in Figure 1. The inclusion/exclusion
criteria and adjustment profiles of the included meta-analyses are
summarized in Supplementary material online, Table S9.

m2 increase in BMI varied from 10% (RR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.01-1.21; certainty of evidence, low) for haemorrhagic stroke to 49% (RR, 1.49;
95% CI, 1.40-1.60; certainty of evidence, high) for hypertension
(Figure 2A). The risk of cardiovascular events was increased in the
overweight population (BMI > 25-30 kg/m2) vs. the reference group
with normal BMI values (HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.08-1.20; certainty of evidence, very low for CHD, and RR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.00-1.40; certainty
of evidence, low for sudden cardiac death) (Figure 2A). The risk of
developing CVD was increased in the obese population (BMI >
30-35 kg/m2) compared with the normal group (HR, 1.16; 95% CI,
1.04-1.28; certainty of evidence, very low for all-cause stroke to
HR, 2.24; 95% CI, 1.73-2.90; certainty of evidence, high for pulmonary embolism) (Figure 2A). The risk of mortality for every
5 kg/m2 (BMI) increment was escalated to divergent extents (RR,
1.05; 95% CI, 1.02-1.07; certainty of evidence, low for all-cause

topics17,21; we assigned a moderate level for large prospective cohort
studies and a low level for retrospective studies, since numerous studies
suggested a differentiation of evidence levels between prospective and
retrospective cohort studies.39-41 The small study effects were judged by
the GRADE's imprecision and publication bias evaluation.42 The risk of
bias evaluation was tailored for observational and MR studies because the
study designs involved different biases. Observational studies are more
susceptible to confounding, reverse causation, and selection biases, while
MR studies are more commonly affected by weak instrument bias and
pleiotropic effects.21,43 The risk of bias was evaluated using the
Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS)44 for observational studies and a modified NOS for MR studies. The evaluation of all other components of
GRADE was adhered to the guideline.45 The 53 previously reported
associations were classified according to the GRADE framework and are
presented as evidence maps (Graphical abstract and Table 1). Further

stratifying the association between obesity and each CVD outcome
into distinct evidence levels. Twelve systematic reviews with 53
meta-analyses comprising over 501 cohorts and 30 million participants were subjected to a quantitative synthesis and quality assessment. As observational studies can suggest an association but are
unable to make claims about causation, MR studies were included to
determine causality. Therefore, we provide results from observational and MR studies in parallel to contextualize both the magnitude of
association and the causality. The novel findings and insights provided
by this umbrella review are summarized in Table 1. This work is a
landmark study in that it provides guidance on how to integrate

to date to enable a more reliable interpretation of epidemiological
relationships.
We also re-analysed all published data to uncover the non-explicit
details, particularly the heterogeneous impact of adiposity among
various global regions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
region-specific quantitative synthesis of all cardiovascular outcomes
relative to adiposity. The overall patterns were consistent across
regions for diverse cardiovascular phenotypes; however, there were
some exceptions; for example, European and Asian populations
showed greater increases in cardiovascular death risk per 5 kg/m2

..
Several MR studies have reported that BMI has no causal effect on
..
.. stroke,61-63 and stroke was the least affected entity in our analysis.
.. This result corroborates that of a recent study conducted by Khera
..
.. et al.51 in which stroke occurred less frequently than most other
..
.. CVDs, such as hypertension and venous thrombo-embolism, in high
.. BMI PRS carriers (10th percentile); this observation probably indi..
.. cates that the genetic drivers for obesity have a weak causal effect on
.. the development of stroke. The discordance in the results of obser..
.. vational and MR analyses for stroke (Table 1) in our umbrella review
.. may suggest that stroke pathophysiology involves a complex mechan..
.. ism in which obesity is only a minor part.64 Other explanations for
.. the discordance include the possible heterogeneous interactive
..
.. effects of different adiposity measures (e.g. BMI and fat mass index)
.. and stroke subtypes; for example, a positive association of fat mass
..
.. index with ischaemic stroke, but not haemorrhagic stroke, was
.. reported by an MR study.65
..
..
Obesity is a multifactorial disease that results from interactions be.. tween genetics and lifestyle.66,67 The heritability for obesity is known
..
.. to be around 40%,66,68 while the remainder can be explained by life.. style factors, which suggests that obesity is a modifiable risk factor.69
..
.. In this context, the causal effect of obesity on nearly all specific car.. diovascular outcomes suggested in this study provides an enthusiastic
..
.. prospect in which lifestyle modification to reduce adiposity can result
.. in the overall reduction of cardiovascular health problems and sub..
.. stantial health-economic burden.70 This study supports the assertion
.. that reducing adiposity through interventional approaches such as
..
.. bariatric surgery,71 promotion of educational equality,72 lifestyle
..
.. modifications including healthy diets,73-78 and increasing physical
.. activities77 may better improve one's well-being,79 even more so
..
.. than previously expected, by affecting multiple vascular health out.. comes. Our results also support the diet and lifestyle recommenda..
.. tions proposed by the American Heart Association80 and European
.. Society of Cardiology81 and further specify the benefits. Future stud..
.. ies should aim to provide empirical evidence of the effect of lifestyle
.. modifications targeted at reducing adiposity on cardiovascular
..
.. benefits.
..
..
.. Limitations
..
.. This study has several limitations. First, umbrella reviews have intrin.. sic limitations in that they focus only on existing meta-analyses;
..
.. therefore, important phenotypes that were not assessed at the meta.. analysis level may be overlooked. To minimize the disregard of clinic..
.. ally relevant cardiovascular phenotypes, we independently
.. conducted de novo meta-analyses for certain CVDs (e.g. aortic valve
..
.. stenosis) that have not been meta-analysed despite a sufficient num.. ber of published original studies. Second, when meta-analyses are
..
.. outdated, they may provide incomplete conclusions with less power,
.. which may directly affect the analyses of subsequent umbrella
..
.. reviews. As a countermeasure, we updated 19 meta-analyses of ob.. servational studies by incorporating recent reports from 35 cohorts
..
.. to reflect up-to-date conclusions. Third, most genetic studies con.. ducted to date have been conducted of European ancestry82; the MR
..
.. studies included in this review used genome-wide association study
.. summary statistics from European-ancestry cohorts, such as the UK

residual confounding factors such as diverse comorbidities such as
diabetes mellitus and dyslipidaemia; Aune et al.46 reported significant
associations between adiposity and all-cause mortality in crude analysis, but not in sensitivity analyses that adjusted for such potential
intermediate traits (Supplementary material online, Table S9). It is
plausible that the observational results of all-cause mortality may
have been overestimated by comorbidities and other intermediate
or surrogate causes for death in cohorts that are not necessarily
driven by cardiovascular impairment.
Several points should be considered for the proper interpretation
of the MR results. Mendelian randomization studies rely on certain
assumptions,21,22 of which that regarding horizontal pleiotropy is
known to be the most challenging to address. The horizontal pleiotropic effect represents the effects of GI (e.g. variants) on multiple
biological pathways, which confounds interpretation of the MR
results.17,21 We checked for the assumptions for each MR study and
confirmed that no horizontal pleiotropy was suspected with all but
TIA and CHD (per 1 kg/m2 increase) (Supplementary material online,
Table S4). However, this does not necessarily weaken our analyses;
although an MR result for TIA was reported in this review, it was not
used in the interpretation (Table 1) since TIA was not investigated in
observational studies; while CHD (per 1 kg/m2 increase) was at risk
of pleiotropy, CHD (per 5 kg/m2 increase) still met the assumptions,
and because both CHD MR results similarly supported positive causation of adiposity on CHD, it is less likely to alter the interpretations.
For the MR analysis, Wade et al.47 used the polygenic risk score
(PRS), comprising 77 single nucleotide polymorphisms associated
with BMI as reported in the Genetic Investigation of Anthropometric
Traits (GIANT) consortium, as the GI, which explained 1.82% of the
variance (equivalent to at least >60 in F-statistics). The proportion of
variance (R2) explained by the GI was deemed acceptable, as it was
>10 in F-statistics,21,48-50 and the explanatory power of PRS for obesity was deemed reliable.51 While there are some limitations to the
MR approaches incorporated in our study, such as potential pleiotropic effect (e.g. TIA) and limited statistical power for certain CVD
phenotypes (Supplementary material online, Table S3),22,52 it is likely
that any potential biases are less marked than those of observational
studies47 because the assumptions for MR were generally met.21 The
triangulation of different methodologies is essential for inferring definite conclusions with proper causal inference,47 and the findings
from the MR studies may add to the current body of evidence implicating obesity as a risk factor for cardiovascular health outcomes.
The risk of the incidence of all CVDs except stroke was significantly increased with obesity in both observational and MR analyses
(Figures 2 and 3). A large number of mediators released by the adipose tissue may play a key role in the link between obesity and CVD.
Adipose tissues release bioactive mediators that influence alterations
in lipids, coagulation, fibrinolysis, and inflammation, leading to endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis.53 Atherosclerosis is the principal origin of CVD54,55; it synergistically interacts with hypertension,
and both factors aggravate one another.54,56 It is notable that hypertension was the most vulnerable entity affected by BMI in our analysis;
the increase in the risk of developing CVD for every 5 kg/m2 increase
in BMI ranged from 10% (RR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.01-1.21) for haemorrhagic stroke to 49% (RR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.40-1.60) for hypertension.
Other CVDs may be the consequence of atherosclerosis and

Association between adiposity and cardiovascular outcomes

Conclusions
Although obesity as a risk factor for various cardiovascular outcomes
has been extensively studied for decades, only 26 of the 53 (49%)
associations reported here were supported by high-level evidence.
While other associations could be genuine, various degrees of uncertainty remain. The results of this study corroborated the causative
effect of obesity on nine of 16 CVD-related outcomes, and the
remaining four mortality outcomes and three risk factors for incident
stroke (all-cause, ischaemic, and haemorrhagic stroke) are at risk of
potential reverse causation bias and require further clarification.

This European bias should be resolved in future genetic studies by
focusing on diverse ancestries. Fourth, as with previous umbrella
reviews of obesity, we did not analyse the effect of underweight on
CVD outcomes.83,84 Although a lower BMI is known to affect CVD
outcomes and the association constitutes a J-shaped curve, this analysis was beyond the scope of this investigation because our research
question mainly lies in whether and to what extent adiposity causally
affects various CVD outcomes. Fifth, some analyses may be susceptible to type I error by repeating statistical significance tests of
updated meta-analyses and involving small studies.85,86 The small
studies may draw underpowered conclusions and subsequently feature an increased likelihood of type II error as well.85 To consider
such small study effects, we examined the composite of sample size,
width of confidence interval, and statistical power to judge the 'imprecision' of the GRADE framework and downgraded the evidence
level for the detection of such deficiencies. And finally, although we
conducted subgroup analyses for potential modifiers such as sex and
region, there are likely residual effect modifiers. Furthermore, correlations among outcomes may influence pooled effect sizes. Such residual effect modifiers and correlations among outcomes are subject
to future exploration with meta-regressions and multivariate metaanalyses.87,88
