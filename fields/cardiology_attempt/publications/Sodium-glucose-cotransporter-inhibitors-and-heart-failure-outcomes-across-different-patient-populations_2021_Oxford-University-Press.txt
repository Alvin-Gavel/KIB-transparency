Graphical Abstract These bubble plots demonstrate the consistent reductions in time to cardiovascular mortality or first heart failure hospitalization with SGLT2 inhibitors across all trials, with a greater absolute risk reduction in patients at higher risk. The size of the bubble represents the
sample size of the trial. Number needed to treat (NNT) is estimated from the absolute risk reduction Event rates of first heart failure hospitalization
or cardiovascular mortality were not reported in SOLOIST-WHF; we used 12-month Kaplan Meier event rates estimated by Cotter et al.19

Sodium glucose co-transporter inhibitors and heart failure outcomes

Type-2 diabetes mellitus
All four cardiovascular outcomes trials in patients with type 2 diabetes-EMPA-REG OUTCOME (Empagliflozin Cardiovascular
Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients), CANVAS
(Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study), DECLARE-TIMI 58
(Multicenter Trial to Evaluate the Effect of Dapagliflozin on the
Incidence of Cardiovascular Events), and VERTIS-CV (Evaluation Of
Ertugliflozin Efficacy And Safety Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial) trials-showed remarkably consistent effect on hospitalization for
heart failure (27-35% relative risk reduction), even though they
showed inconsistent effects on other cardiovascular and renal
events.4-7 These benefits were observed in those with and without a
history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Similarly, these benefits were consistent in the majority of those who did not have a history of heart failure, as well as those who did.

Chronic kidney disease
Three trials have studied the effect of these drugs in patients with
chronic kidney disease, i.e. CREDENCE (Evaluation of the Effects of

Canagliflozin on Renal and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Participants
With Diabetic Nephropathy); DAPA CKD (A Study to Evaluate the
Effect of Dapagliflozin on Renal Outcomes and Cardiovascular
Mortality in Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease); and SCORED
(Cardiovascular and Renal Events in Patients With Type 2
Diabetes and Moderate Renal Impairment Who Are at
Cardiovascular Risk).8-10 In these high-risk patients for heart failure
hospitalizations, a consistent risk reduction was observed, ranging
from 25% to 30%. The CREDENCE trial enrolled 15% of patients
with a history of heart failure, and reported consistent results in both
patients with and without heart failure. DAPA CKD enrolled patients
with (68%) and without (32%) diabetes and reported benefits in both
groups (P interaction = 0.78).11 These data are the first to suggest the
primary prevention of heart failure in patients without diabetes with
SGLT inhibitors.

Heart failure with reduced
ejection fraction
The DAPA-HF (Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse-Outcomes
in Heart Failure) trial and EMPEROR-Reduced (Empagliflozin
Outcome Trial In Patients With Chronic Heart Failure With
Reduced Ejection Fraction) trial evaluated the effects of dapagliflozin
and empagliflozin, respectively, in patients with heart failure and
reduced ejection fraction.12-14 Both trials showed reduction in time
to cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization, time to first
heart failure hospitalization, total (first and recurrent) heart failure
hospitalization, and all worsening heart failure events (heart failure
hospitalization or need for intensification of diuretics in nonhospitalized settings).15-16 These benefits were seen in patients
regardless of diabetes status, chronic kidney disease, or baseline therapy. The magnitude of benefit for heart failure hospitalization was
near identical in both trials at 30%.

Worsening heart failure
SOLOIST-WHF (Effect of Sotagliflozin on Cardiovascular Events in
Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Post Worsening Heart Failure) trial
studied the effects of sotagliflozin, a combined SGLT2/SGLT1 inhibitor, in a population comprising of both heart failure with reduced or
preserved ejection fraction, who had diabetes and worsening heart
failure.17 There was a 36% relative risk reduction observed for hospitalization or urgent visits for heart failure with sotagliflozin; benefits
were consistent across major patient subgroups.

Heart failure with preserved
ejection fraction
In the EMPEROR-Preserved (Empagliflozin Outcome Trial in Patients
with Chronic Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction), empagliflozin reduced the risk of cardiovascular death and heart failure
hospitalization in patients with heart failure and preserved ejection
fraction.18 There was a 30% relative risk reduction for total heart failure hospitalizations. Consistent with heart failure and reduced

Hospitalization for heart failure marks a fundamental change in the
natural history of the disease and portends a poor prognosis for the
patients. For those without a history of heart failure, a hospitalization
signals development of new onset heart failure that is associated with
40-50% 5-year mortality risk.1 Amongst those with a previous history of heart failure, worsening symptoms leading to hospitalization
are associated with 20-25% 1 year mortality risk, a 20% 4-week
readmission risk and a 50% 6-month readmission risk.1 In observational studies, these risks are apparent whether a person has heart
failure with reduced or preserved ejection fraction.2 Recent clinical
trials have demonstrated that worsening heart failure is associated
with the highest absolute risk of heart failure hospitalization, followed
by chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, and then
chronic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction in the outpatient setting. Relative to patients with manifest heart failure, the absolute risk of heart failure hospitalizations is lower in populations
with chronic kidney disease and diabetes without prevalent heart failure, but these patients nevertheless are at a higher risk than those
without these comorbidities. Indeed, in patients with diabetes mellitus, the risk for heart failure has been shown to be higher and less
amenable to reduction with risk factor control than myocardial infarction and diabetes.3 Besides portending risk, these hospitalizations
are associated with high costs, both to an individual as well as the society, accounting for most of the overall annual direct cost of care
related to heart failure.1 Thus, prevention of hospitalizations for heart
failure is an important clinical, patient-centric and societal goal.
Sodium glucose co-transporter (SGLT2) inhibitors were originally
developed for glycemic control in patient with type-2 diabetes. These
drugs subsequently have been shown to have a remarkably consistent benefit in reducing the risk of adverse heart failure outcomes
across diverse patient populations (Table 1). Furthermore, the absolute risk reduction in heart failure outcomes with SGLT2 inhibitors is
higher in patients who are at a higher risk for adverse outcomes

ejection fraction data, benefits were seen regardless of diabetes status or chronic kidney disease. In the SOLOIST trial, there was a small
group of patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction;
this group also benefitted in terms of hospitalization or urgent visits
for heart failure risk.
In total, so far this experience represents over 75 000 randomized patients and over 3000 first heart failure events. (Graphical
Abstract) The effect of SGLT2i on heart failure hospitalization risk
reduction is remarkably consistent in both the primary prevention
and secondary prevention cohorts. The primary prevention risk reduction is seen in both patients with or without diabetes and with
or without atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and in those
with chronic kidney disease. The secondary prevention benefit has
now been demonstrated in patients with heart failure and reduced
ejection fraction and preserved ejection fraction and in patients
with stable or with worsening heart failure. While the link between heart failure hospitalization and mortality has been well
associated, the lack of consistent mortality benefit in these trials
despite robust consistent heart failure hospitalization risk reduction
is intriguing. It may be related to a need for longer follow-up, as
there was non-statistically significant favourable directional benefit
seen in most trials for cardiovascular mortality. This issue will require further studies.
This success in reducing the risk of heart failure event by SGLT
inhibitors across patient populations to a clinically important and remarkably consistent degree is not only a moment for celebration, but
also an opportunity for humility, recognizing the serendipity that
these strikingly effective drugs were originally and primarily developed to lower blood glucose.
