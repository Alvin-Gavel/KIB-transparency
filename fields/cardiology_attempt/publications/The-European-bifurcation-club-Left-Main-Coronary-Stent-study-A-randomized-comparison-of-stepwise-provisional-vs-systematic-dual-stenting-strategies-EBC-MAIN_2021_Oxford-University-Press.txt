Background

Patients with non-left-main coronary bifurcation lesions are usually best treated with a stepwise provisional approach. However, patients with true left main stem bifurcation lesions have been shown in one dedicated randomized study to benefit from systematic dual stent implantation.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
Four hundred and sixty-seven patients with true left main stem bifurcation lesions requiring intervention were
and results
recruited to the EBC MAIN study in 11 European countries. Patients were aged 71 +/- 10 years; 77% were male.
Patients were randomly allocated to a stepwise layered provisional strategy (n = 230) or a systematic dual stent approach (n = 237). The primary endpoint (a composite of death, myocardial infarction, and target lesion revascularization at 12 months) occurred in 14.7% of the stepwise provisional group vs. 17.7% of the systematic dual stent
group (hazard ratio 0.8, 95% confidence interval 0.5-1.3; P = 0.34). Secondary endpoints were death (3.0% vs. 4.2%,
P = 0.48), myocardial infarction (10.0% vs. 10.1%, P = 0.91), target lesion revascularization (6.1% vs. 9.3%, P = 0.16),
and stent thrombosis (1.7% vs. 1.3%, P = 0.90), respectively. Procedure time, X-ray dose and consumables favoured
the stepwise provisional approach. Symptomatic improvement was excellent and equal in each group.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusions
Among patients with true bifurcation left main stem stenosis requiring intervention, fewer major adverse cardiac
events occurred with a stepwise layered provisional approach than with planned dual stenting, although the difference was not statistically significant. The stepwise provisional strategy should remain the default for distal left main
stem bifurcation intervention.

approach.

Introduction
Optimal treatment of coronary bifurcation anatomy remains a subject
of debate, 15 years on from the publication of the first large randomized trial.1 Trials of all-comer bifurcation lesions have demonstrated
that there is no advantage to systematic dual drug-eluting stent strategies1-3 and indeed that long-term mortality may be worse with a
more complex approach.4 For the left main stem, it might be expected
that these differences would be magnified, given the wide angle of separation between the two vessels, the heavy calcification often involved
and the fact that neither vessel is a side branch. Non-randomized data
uniformly suggests that outcomes are worse with a two-stent strategy,5-7 but randomized data support the double kissing (DK) crush
technique for true bifurcation left main stem disease8,9 and support it
over culotte.10 The European Bifurcation Club Left Main Coronary
Stent Study (EBC MAIN) was designed to examine clinical outcomes
in patients with distal bifurcation left main stem lesions undergoing
intervention, randomly allocated to either a stepwise layered provisional stent strategy, or a systematic dual stenting strategy.11

Methods
The study was an investigator-led prospective randomized multicentre
trial devised by and run through the European Bifurcation Club (www.

using standard random number generation methodology with stratification by centre.

Revascularization procedure
Pre-percutaneous coronary intervention

Percutaneous coronary intervention procedure
Intravenous unfractionated heparin 70 IU/kg was given at the start of the
procedure to maintain an activated clotting time of >_250 s. Access site,
use of glycoprotein inhibitors and use of IVUS or optimal coherence tomography was at the discretion of the operator. The OnyxV zotarolimuseluting coronary stent (Medtronic) was used in the study. This stent has
4.5 mm and 5 mm diameter options which can be valuable in the left main.
R

Stepwise provisional single stent group
The protocol specified the procedural steps for this group of patients.
Coronary guide wires were passed to the left anterior descending (LAD)
and circumflex (Cx)/intermediate arteries, respectively. One was designated the main vessel and one the side vessel. Lesion preparation was
undertaken as required but side vessel predilatation was discouraged unless considered essential by the operator, to reduce the risk of an unsecured dissection. Stenting of the main vessel was undertaken with a
wire jailed in the side vessel to preserve side vessel flow and access. Stent
diameter was chosen according to the diameter of the main vessel immediately distal to the bifurcation. Following stenting of the left main into the
main vessel, the left main stent was dilated to the carina with a short noncompliant balloon of appropriate size for the left main stem (proximal optimization technique, POT). Following this, the side vessel was rewired
through a distal stent strut where possible, and a kissing balloon inflation
was undertaken. Kissing balloon sizes were chosen according to the diameter of the distal main and side vessel respectively, with individual higher
pressure inflation followed by a final lower pressure kiss dilatation. The
left main stent was then dilated using either low pressure dilatation of the
kissing balloon pair or a separate individual balloon. For these dilatations,
non-compliant balloons were preferred to limit the risk of dissection
through uneven expansion. Following kissing dilatation, the side vessel
was not to be treated further unless there was one of the following:
<TIMI 3 flow in the side vessel, severe (>90%) ostial pinching of the side
vessel, threatened side-vessel closure or side-vessel dissection >type A.
Under these circumstances, the operator could choose to implant a side
vessel stent in a manner of their choosing (e.g. T, TAP, culotte). Following
implantation of a second stent, repeat POT followed by recrossing and
repeat kissing balloon inflation was mandatory, again using non-compliant
balloons as above, with individual very high pressure inflations at the stent
bifurcations followed by final kissing balloons at lower pressures. Further
treatment to proximal or distal aspects of the main vessel or side vessel
could be continued at the discretion of the operator in the event of, for
example, proximal or distal dissections.

Systematic planned two-stent group
The protocol specified the procedural steps for this group of patients.
Coronary guide wires were passed to the LAD and Cx/intermediate
arteries, respectively. One was designated the main vessel and one the
side vessel. Lesion preparation was undertaken as considered necessary

Patients were assessed for angina status (Canadian Cardiovascular
Society-CCS) and extent of anti-anginal medication (angina index).
Serum creatine kinase (CK) and high sensitivity troponin were measured
pre-procedure. Operators were expected to be undertaking >_150 PCI
procedures per year. Antiplatelet regimen of choice was at the operator's
discretion. Antiplatelet loading was to be made >_3 h before the procedure to antiplatelet-naive patients.

..
.. but could be one of culotte, DK-minicrush, T or TAP. Stent diameter was
.. made according to the diameter of the vessel immediately distal to the bi..
.. furcation. Specific practical steps varied according to the technique
.. chosen. In the culotte strategy, after the first stent was implanted and
..
.. POT done, the second vessel was rewired (ideally distally), predilated
.. and a stent placed with a short overlap only to the main vessel stent. A se.. cond POT was made and the main vessel rewired. A final kiss was made
..
.. with high pressure individual dilatations at the bifurcation of the stents fol.. lowed by a lower pressure kiss at the neocarina. A final POT or low-pres..
.. sure inflation of the two kissing balloons was made back to the proximal
.. edge of the left main stem stent to ensure full apposition. Similar proced..
.. ural steps, with appropriate variations, were required for the T, TAP, and
.. DK-minicrush procedures, according to the principles laid out in previous
.. European Bifurcation Club recommendations.12,13 Further treatment to
..
.. the proximal or distal aspects of the main vessel or side vessel could be
.. made at the discretion of the operator. At any stage, proximal or distal
..
.. dissections could be treated as required with further stent implantations.
..
..
.. Post-percutaneous coronary intervention
.. Creatine kinase and troponin were measured 6-24 h post-PCI. Aspirin
..
.. 75 mg daily was continued long term. Clopidogrel 75 mg daily was given
.. for a minimum of 6 months (or appropriate dose of prasugrel or ticagre..
.. lor). Discontinuation of antiplatelet agents for soft indications was strong.. ly discouraged. Statin therapy was continued for the duration of the
.. study. Procedural angiograms were sent to the CoreLab for analysis.
..
..
.. Follow-up
..
.. Patients were followed up by telephone or in person pre-discharge, at
.. 6 months (+/-15 days) and 12 months (+/-30 days). At the 6-month follow..
.. up, patient symptoms and wellbeing were established. Significant symp.. toms triggered further investigation as required. At 1-year follow-up,
..
.. symptoms, angina index, adverse events, and endpoints were assessed.
.. Follow-up could be made by telephone if necessary. Adverse event track.. ing began at randomization and continued to the end of the 12-month fol..
.. low-up period in a cohort block. All revascularization and possible stent
.. thrombosis cases were reviewed by the CoreLab.
..
..
.. Endpoints
..
.. Primary endpoint
.. The primary endpoint of the study was a composite of all-cause death,

.. myocardial infarction, and target lesion revascularization at 12 months.
..
..
.. Secondary endpoints
.. These were the individual components of the primary endpoint, angina
..
.. status, angina medication, and adjudicated stent thrombosis.
..
..
.. Definitions
.. Myocardial infarction
..
.. The Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction (Revision 2013) was
.. used to define myocardial infarction in this study, except for the category
.. of PCI-related myocardial infarction (Type 4a) or coronary artery bypass
..
.. graft-related myocardial infarction (Type 5). Under these circumstances,
.. the more practical expert consensus definition from Society for
..
.. Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI) was used.14
.. Therefore, in patients who are stable on admission, the peak biomarker
..
.. measured post-PCI will need to rise to 10 the local laboratory upper
.. limit of normal (ULN) for CK [5 with new persistent left bundle branch
.. block (LBBB) or Q waves] or 70 the local laboratory ULN for troponin
..
. (35 with new persistent LBBB or Q waves). In patients with an acute

3832
coronary presentation and raised biomarkers on admission, the peak biomarker measured post-PCI will need to rise to an absolute increase of
10 the local laboratory ULN for CK (5 with persistent LBBB or Q
waves) or an absolute increase of 70 the local laboratory ULN for
troponin (35 with persistent LBBB or Q waves).

Target vessel revascularization

Technical success
Completion of stent placement, balloon dilatation, rewiring, and final kissing balloon therapy as required by the protocol.

Procedure success
Placement of stents as per randomization with TIMI 3 flow and <30%
stenosis in any stented vessel and TIMI 3 flow in any unstented vessel.

Angina index
Angina medication scoring system, scoring 1 each for glyceryl trinitrate
spray; oral nitrate; b-blocker; calcium antagonist; nicorandil or other
(max score 5).

Statistical methods
Descriptive data analyses were conducted depending on the nature of
the considered criteria. For quantitative data, this included number of
observed values (and missing values, if any), mean, standard deviation, median, first and third quartiles, and minimum and maximum. For qualitative
data, this included the number of observed and missing values and the
number and percentage of patients per class. Comparisons between
treatment groups were assessed with chi-square or the Fisher's exact
test for categorical variables and the Student's t-test or Wilcoxon test for
quantitative variables. Normality of variables was graphically confirmed.
The statistical analysis method for the primary endpoint was based on
Kaplan-Meier methods and the log-rank test was used to test for treatment group differences. Furthermore, the treatment effect was estimated
as well as its accuracy (estimate of the hazard ratio and 95% confidence
interval) using a Cox hazard proportional regression model with treatment group as the only covariate. The hypothesis for the study was that
left main coronary true bifurcation lesions (type 1,1,1 or 0,1,1: both LAD
and Cx >2.75 mm diameter) would be best treated with a planned single
stent stepwise strategy rather than a planned dual stent strategy, with respect to death, target lesion revascularization and myocardial infarction at
1 year. At the time of protocol development, left main stem bifurcation
data from published studies suggest that the primary endpoint might be
reached in 14% (single) vs. 25% (dual) patients at 1 year. Using these estimates, a two-sided significance (1-alpha) of 95% and 80% power, a sample
size of 404 patients was developed. Allowing for a 10% loss-to-follow-up
rate, the study was powered for 450 randomizations. One interim analysis was planned for the primary endpoint. This was undertaken at the
first/third recruitment stage and allowed for stopping the trial early for
positive efficacy using an alpha-spending function if needed. Analyses
were done on an intention-to-treat basis using SAS 9.4 software.

Results
Between February 2016 and November 2019, 467 patients were
randomized into the EBC MAIN study at 31 sites in 11 European
countries. Two hundred and thirty patients were randomized to the
stepwise layered provisional approach, 237 to the systematic dual
stent approach. There were major protocol deviations in 6 single and
12 dual patients, respectively [including failure to undergo PCI (n = 8)
and failure to use the Onyx stent (n = 4)]; all remained in the analysis
on an intention-to-treat basis. Patient demographics and clinical features are shown in Table 1. Patients were aged 71 +/- 10 years. 77%
were male and 28% were diabetic. Two-thirds of patients were
treated electively.
Procedural characteristics are shown in Table 2. Most patients had
a transradial approach, with 6 F guiding catheters. Intravenous antiplatelet agents were rarely used. In three-quarters of patients, the LAD
was designated the main continuation vessel. Among those randomized to the stepwise provisional approach, side vessel predilatation
was undertaken in about half of cases. In those who were randomized
to a planned two-stent strategy, half had treatment directed into the
main vessel first, half into the side vessel. The culotte was the most
commonly used two-stent technique. Five percent of patients allocated to the dual stent strategy had only a single stent implanted.
Twenty-two percent of patients in the stepwise provisional group
had a second bifurcation stent implanted (the final path of the stepwise strategy).
Utilization of consumables is shown in Table 3. More balloons and
stents were used in the systematic dual stenting group, and the total
stented length was greater. Procedure duration, fluoroscopy time,
and X-ray dose were higher in the dual-stent group. Technical success was lower in the provisional group but procedural success was
higher in the provisional group. The procedural sequence of events is
shown in Table 4, to delineate the flow of procedures in each group.
The primary and secondary endpoints of the trial are shown in
Table 5. One patient was lost to follow-up in each group. There was
no difference between groups at 1 year in terms of death, myocardial
infarction, target lesion revascularization, or the composite of the
three (the primary endpoint). Periprocedural myocardial infarction
outcomes were underscored by recording of CK (n = 279), CK-MB
(n = 152), or troponin (n = 198). 85% of patients had appropriate cardiac enzyme measurement.
The trial results are shown diagrammatically in Figure 1, and in
Kaplan-Meier form in Figure 2. Symptomatic relief was good in both
groups with a mean improvement in CCS class from 1.8 to 0.5, and a
mean improvement in angina index from 1.4 to 0.8 (Table 6).
Quantitative coronary angiography results from the CoreLab (Pie
Medical CERC) are shown in Table 7. Proximal main vessel and side
vessel minimal luminal diameter post-procedure were both larger in
the systematic dual stenting group.

Discussion
In this study, we have found that stent treatment for true left main
stem bifurcation lesions can be undertaken with low 1-year adverse
event rates employing either the stepwise provisional approach or a

If either main vessel or side vessel requires or undergoes attempted repeat revascularization with either balloon angioplasty, stenting, or coronary artery bypass grafting, within the previous treated vessel area (balloon
or stent) or within 5 mm adjacent to this area.

systematic dual stenting technique (Graphical abstract). Symptomatic
improvement and reduction in use of anti-anginal medications were
highly significant in both groups. Procedure duration, X-ray dose and
consumables were reduced. The results support a default stepwise
provisional strategy for true left main stem bifurcation lesions requiring intervention.
The vast majority (78%) of the patients in the stepwise provisional
approach received a single stent. The advantage of the stepwise strategy is therefore that it does not prejudge the anatomical requirements. The approach is layered and sequential and the procedure is
complete when a good result is obtained at any stage in the
sequence.
The main study of comparison is the DKCRUSH-V8 trial published
in 2017. In this comprehensive study, the DK crush and provisional
stenting strategies were compared. At 1 year, the primary endpoint
(a composite of cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction,
and target lesion revascularization) occurred in 10.7% of provisional
cases and 5.0% of DK crush cases (P = 0.02). This compares with the
primary endpoint (a composite of death, myocardial infarction, and
target lesion revascularization) of 14.7% and 17.7% in our study. Why
are the results different in the two studies?
Firstly, the definitions in the studies were different. The
DKCRUSH-V study used cardiac death and target vessel-related
myocardial infarction rather than death and myocardial infarction and
this will have reduced the overall number of events. Secondly, the
coronary anatomy was different. The respective SYNTAX scores
were 31 (DK crush) vs. 23 (EBC MAIN) and the side-vessel lesion
lengths were 16 mm (DK crush) vs. 7 mm (EBC MAIN-although the
measurement methodology may have differed between the studies).
Therefore, the extent of disease was greater in the DKCRUSH-V
study and indeed 45% of patients in the provisional group had implantation of two stents vs. 22% in EBC MAIN.
Thirdly, the philosophical approach varied between the two trials.
The DK crush technique was pioneered by the Chinese Cardiology
teams who undertook the DKCRUSH-V trial,15 whereas the stepwise provisional approach has been championed by the European
Bifurcation Club since its inception.16 Hence unconscious biases are
likely to have played a part in both trials. Attention to detail with regard to the specific technical aspects of each procedure likely differed
in the two studies, and results may have varied slightly as a result. For
example, in the DKCRUSH-V study, the POT was not described as a
part of the procedure after initial stent placement in the main vessel,
and therefore wire passage behind stent struts may have occurred in
some cases, whereas in EBC MAIN it was required and was undertaken in 85%. It is of note that the stent thrombosis rate in the two
trials was seen to be 2.5% (DK) vs. 1.7% (EBC) for the provisional
group and 0.4% (DK) vs. 1.3% (EBC) for the systematic group.
Angiographic follow-up was undertaken in the DKCRUSH-V
study. This was scheduled for 13 months (after planned ascertainment of the 12-month primary endpoint); however, there was a sudden spike in target lesion revascularization at 12 months (from 3.0%
to 7.4% in the provisional group) related to early angiography-based
revascularization (mean angiography time 367 +/- 49 days). This may
have been a factor in the unconscious biases noted above as operators could not be blinded to the previous treatment.
The systematic dual stent techniques used in the two trials were
different. In the DKCRUSH-V trial, the DK crush approach was used

BBC ONE trial,3 revascularization after a two-stent strategy was numerically more likely to require coronary artery bypass grafting rather than PCI.
Stent thrombosis rates were low in both groups. The two-stent
strategy has frequently been associated with higher stent thrombosis
rates in the literature17; however, in both the DKCRUSH-V and EBC
MAIN studies, stent thrombosis rates at 1 year were low, and undifferentiated between the two groups. The low incidence of stent
thrombosis is reassuring and may reflect thinner-strut second and
third generation stents along with improved understanding of optimal
implantation characteristics.
In the provisional group, there was no POT (15%), no rewiring of
the second vessel (6%) and no kissing balloon inflation made (11%).
Whether this was largely because the operator felt it was not needed
is not clear. For the two-stent strategy, there was no POT (13%), no
rewiring of the second vessel (1%) and no second stent (5%) and
therefore it is clear that operators still have technical difficulties in a
minority of cases.

Therefore technical success was numerically lower in the stepwise
provisional technique because a minority of cases did not have a kissing balloon inflation (probably as it was thought not necessary).

However, procedural success was numerically lower in the systematic dual-stent strategy due to the number of patients in whom a second stent could not be placed.
Intravascular imaging was used in 40% of cases. It was used equally common in the stepwise provisional strategy as in the systematic
two-stent approach. In the DKCRUSH-V trial, IVUS use was similar
at 41%.

One-year follow-up alone is not adequate and the study will progress to 3-year follow-up in due course. At 1 year, there were numerically more revascularizations in the dual stent group and it will be
interesting to see if this trend expands or contracts over time. It is
worth noting that longer-term follow-up of the NORDIC and BBC
ONE studies demonstrated a mortality difference between the two
techniques that was not present on shorter follow-up.4 The EBC
TWO study is due to report final outcomes soon18 and along with
the DEFINITION II trial,9 the longer-term outcomes will be of considerable interest.

Study limitations
This trial had an open design that meant the operators and patients
were aware of received treatment. This could have led to theoretical

bias in interpreting clinical outcomes. The study event rates were
lower than anticipated and therefore the study was underpowered
to detect a significant difference between the two groups.

Conclusions
Stent treatment of true bifurcation left main stem coronary artery
disease is safe and effective. Patients are treated equally well with a
stepwise layered provisional approach, starting with a single stent, as
with a more complex dual-stent implantation procedure. When a
provisional stepwise approach was used, only one-fifth of patients
required a second stent. The provisional approach should remain the
