Artificial intelligence (AI) has given the electrocardiogram (ECG) and clinicians reading them super-human diagnostic abilities. Trained
without hard-coded rules by finding often subclinical patterns in huge datasets, AI transforms the ECG, a ubiquitous, non-invasive cardiac
test that is integrated into practice workflows, into a screening tool and predictor of cardiac and non-cardiac diseases, often in asymptomatic individuals. This review describes the mathematical background behind supervised AI algorithms, and discusses selected AI ECG cardiac screening algorithms including those for the detection of left ventricular dysfunction, episodic atrial fibrillation from a tracing recorded
during normal sinus rhythm, and other structural and valvular diseases. The ability to learn from big data sets, without the need to understand the biological mechanism, has created opportunities for detecting non-cardiac diseases as COVID-19 and introduced challenges with
regards to data privacy. Like all medical tests, the AI ECG must be carefully vetted and validated in real-world clinical environments.
Finally, with mobile form factors that allow acquisition of medical-grade ECGs from smartphones and wearables, the use of AI may enable
massive scalability to democratize healthcare.

The application of artificial intelligence to the standard electrocardiogram enables it to diagnose conditions not previously identifiable by an electrocardiogram, or to do so with a greater performance than previously possible. This includes identification of the current rhythm, identification of episodic atrial fibrillation from an ECG acquired during sinus rhythm, the presence of ventricular dysfunction (low ejection fraction), the presence of valvular heart disease,
channelopathies (even when electrocardiographically 'concealed'), and the presence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

Broadly speaking, AI can be applied in two ways to the ECG.4 In
one, currently performed human skills, such as determining arrhythmias or acute infarction, are performed in an automated manner
making those skills massively scalable. The second utilization is to extract information from an ECG beyond which a human can typically
perform. In this review, we will focus on the latter.

Machine learning introduction
The term machine learning was coined more than 70 years ago to describe the ability of man-made machines to learn how to perform
complex tasks, and to improve task performance based on additional
experience. Practically, it refers to replacing algorithms that define
the relationship between inputs and outputs using man-made rules
with statistical tools that identify (learn) the most probable relationship between input and output based on repeated exposure to exemplar data elements. As with other revolutionary ideas, when first
introduced, it was ahead of its time, and the data and computing
power required to enable this revolution did not exist. Today, with
exponentially growing digital datasets and a significant increase in the
computational power available to train networks, ML, sometimes
referred to as AI, performs highly complex tasks. In supervised ML,
the task is defined as an optimization problem, which seeks to find
the optimal solution using labelled data. By defining a 'loss function'
or a matrix of how well the machine performs a task and minimizing
the error and maximizing the success matrix, a complex task is transformed into a mathematical problem.
Most ML models are parametric and define a function between an
input space and an output space. In neural networks, designed to
mimic human visual cortex, each 'neuron' is a simple mathematical
equation with parameters that are adjusting during network training.
When the neurons are connected in many layers, it is referred to as a
deep network. The function applies parameters to the input in linear

Despite the fact that the electrocardiogram (ECG) has been in use
for over 100 years and is a central tool in clinical medicine, we are
only now beginning to unleash its full potential with the application of
artificial intelligence (AI). The ECG is the cumulative recording at a
distance (the body surface) of the action potentials of millions of individual cardiomyocytes (Figure 1). Traditionally, clinicians have been
trained to identify specific features such as ST-segment elevation for
acute myocardial infarction, T-wave changes to suggest potassium
abnormalities, and other gross deviations to identify specific clinical
entities. By their very nature, the magnitude of the changes must be
substantial in order to significantly alter a named ECG feature to result in a clinical diagnosis. With the application of convolutional neural
networks to an otherwise standard ECG, multiple non-linear potentially interrelated variations can be recognized in an ECG. Thus, neural networks have been used to: identify a person's sex with startling
precision [area under the curve (AUC) 0.97]; recognize the presence
of left ventricular dysfunction; uncover the presence of silent arrhythmia not present at the time of the recording; as well as identify the
presence of non-cardiac conditions such as cirrhosis.1-3 Many biological phenomena, each of which can leave its imprint on cardiomyocytes electrical function in a unique manner, lead to multiple, subtle,
non-linear, subclinical ECG changes. Although ECGs are filtered between 0.05 and 100 Hertz to augment capture of cardiac signals, they
likely also are influenced directly and indirectly by nerve activity, myopotentials, as well as anatomic considerations such as cardiac rotation, size, and surrounding body habitus. With large datasets to train
a network as to the multiple and varied influences of each of these
conditions, powerful diagnostic tools can be developed. In this review, we will offer an overview of machine learning (ML), show specific examples of conditions not previously diagnosed with an ECG
that are now recognized, and provide an update of the application
and practice and future directions of the AI processed ECG (AI
ECG).

and non-linear ways to derive an estimated output (Figure 2). During
the learning phase, both the inputs and the outputs are shown to the
function, and the parameters (sometimes called 'weights') are
adjusted in an iterative manner, to minimize the difference between
the estimated output and the known outputs. This learning or training
phase often requires large data sets and robust computing power.
The most common way to adjust these weights is by applying a gradient-based optimization method, which adjusts each parameter
weight based on its effect on the error, with the network weights iteratively adjusted until an error minimum is found.
Once the learning phase is complete, the parameters are set, and
the function becomes a simple deterministic algorithm that can be
applied to any unseen input. The computing power required to deploy a trained network is modest and can often be performed from a
smartphone. A neural network is composed of different nodes (representing neurons) connected to each other in a directed way, where
each node calculates a function of its input based on an embedded
changeable parameter (weight) followed by a non-linear function,
and the inputs flow from one set of neurons (called a layer) to the
next. Each layer calculates an intermediate function of the inputs (features), and the final layer is responsible to calculate the final output.
In some architectures, the neurons are connected to each other to
enable determination of temporal patterns (recurrent neural networks), used when the input is a time series; others, such as convolutional neural networks, originally developed for computer vision
tasks, have also been used for natural language processing, video analysis, and time series.
As these models are mathematical functions, the inputs are comprised of real numbers created by sampling physical signals. For example, an ECG is converted to a time series sampled at a consistent

.. sampling frequency in which each sample represents the signal ampli..
.. tude for a given time point. For a 10-s 12 lead ECG sampled at
..
.. 500 Hz, the digital representation of the input is a matrix with 5000
.. samples (500 Hz  10 s) per lead. With 12 leads, the final input will
..
.. be a set of 60 000 numbers (5000  12).
..
For binary models in which the output is 'yes/no', such as the pres..
.. ence of silent atrial fibrillation (AF) determined from an ECG
.. acquired in sinus rhythm, the input numbers (i.e. the digital ECG) are
..
.. used by the network to calculate the probability of silent AF. The out.. put will be a single number, ranging from 0 (no silent AF) to 1 (silent
..
.. AF present). To dichotomize the output, a threshold value deter.. mines whether the model output is positive or negative. By adjusting
..
.. the threshold, the test can be made more sensitive, with more sam.. ples considered positive and fewer missed events, but at the cost of a
..
.. higher number of false positives; or alternatively, more specific, with
.. fewer false positives but more missed events. Since the training of
..
.. supervised ML models requires only labelled data [e.g. ECGs and
..
.. associated ejection fraction (EF) values], and no explicit rules,
.. machines learn to solve tasks that humans don't know how to solve,

Figure 2 A convolutional neural network is trained by feeding in labelled data (in this case voltage time waveforms), and through repetition it identifies the patterns in the data that are associated with the data labels (in this example, heart pump strength, or ejection fraction). The network has
two components, convolution layers that extract image components to create the artificial intelligence features, and the fully connected layers that
comprise the model, that leads to the network output. While large data sets and robust computing are required to train networks, once trained, the
computation requirements are substantially reduced, permitting smartphone application. AI, artificial intelligence; EF, ejection fraction.

Uncertainty
Unless a data quality check is performed before using a model, the
model will generate a result for any given input, including inputs outside of the distribution of data used to train the model. If a model is
fed data outside the range of its training domain, whether due to deficits in the training set or shifts in the data over time, the model may
generate results that do not accurately classify the input. Other factors may also lead to uncertainty. Methods to measure uncertainty
have been described.8-10 To minimize this error, models are evaluated for their consistent performance with inputs that are anticipated within the input distribution that should not affect the outputs.

Robustness
This refers to the ability of a model to accurately classify inputs that
are synthetically modified in and adversarial way in order to favour
misclassification. For example, in Han et al.,11 the authors show that
by using almost-invisible perturbations to an ECG, a model with very
high accuracy for the detection of AF can be fooled into thinking an
normal sinus rhythm (NSR) recording is actually AF with high certainty, and vice versa, even though to the human reviewer the ECGs
looks unchanged.

Metrics for assessing neural
networks
Most neural networks generate an output that is a continuous probability. To create binary outputs a threshold value is selected, with
probabilities above the threshold considered positive. The selection
of the threshold impacts model sensitivity and specificity, with an increase in one at the cost of the other. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve represents all the sensitivity and specificity pairs
for a model, and the AUC (AUC of the ROC), measures how well
the model separates two classes, and is often used to represent
model function. For example, a model with random outputs will have
complete overlap of scores for positive and negative input samples,
yielding an AUC of 0.5, and a perfect model that gives all positive

inputs scores above the threshold, and all negative samples scores
below that threshold (hence perfectly separating the classes) will
have an AUC of 1 (Figure 3). Once a threshold is selected, a confusion
matrix can be calculated, indicating the true and false positive and
negative values, allowing real-world calculation of the sensitivity (also
called recall), specificity, accuracy, weighted accuracy (important
when the classes are imbalanced, due to low prevalence of a disease,
for example), positive predictive value (precision), negative predictive
value (NPV), and more specialized scores as the F1 accuracy.
In cases with imbalanced datasets, some measurements will appear
optimistic. For example, in detecting a disease with a 1% prevalence,
a model that always generates a score of 0 will be right 99% of the
times, yielding an accuracy of 99%, but a sensitivity of 0%. In less extreme cases, an imbalanced dataset might still appear optimistic with
some measurements.12 With the AUC of the ROC, for example, one
of the axes of the curve (the false positive rate) is calculated as false
positive/(false positive th true positive) and is less sensitive to changes
in false positives when the negative class grows relative to the positive samples. While with unbalanced data sets, it may be an optimistic
measurement, and a different metric might be more accurate (the
area under the recall-precision curve, that takes prevalence into account as part of the precision, for example), the AUC of the ROC is
often used to compare models, particularly with regards to medical
tests. In this review article, we present the statistics reported in the
original work (predominantly AUC values).

Left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD), AF, and hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy (HCM) share three characteristics: they are frequently under-diagnosed; they are associated with significant morbidity; and once detected, effective, evidence-based therapies are
available.2,3,13,14 Routine screening strategies are not currently recommended due to the absence of effective screening tools.15-17 The
ECG is a rapid, cost-effective, point-of-care test that requires no
blood and no reagents, that is massively scalable with smartphone
technology to medical and non-medical environments. The AI ECG
provides information beyond what is visible to the eyes of an experienced clinician with manual ECG interpretation today. Specific use
cases are detailed below. Many of AI models have been developed in
parallel by different research groups. In Table 1, we summarize these
and include key model performance and characteristic information.

Artificial intelligence to screen for
left ventricular systolic
dysfunction
Several research groups have used ECG-based deep learning networks to detect LVSD.2,4,19,23,24,36 We engineered a neural network
using 50 000 ECG-echocardiogram pairs for training that was able to
discriminate low EF (<_35%) from EF >35% with a high accuracy

intermediate layers typically are not comprehensible to humans.
Explainability refers to uncovering the underlying rules that a model
finds during training, Explainability may help humans understand what
gives a model its super-human abilities, enhance user trust of AI tools,
uncover novel pathophysiologic mechanisms by identifying relationships between input signals and outputs, and reveal network vulnerabilities. One method of understanding a model is by looking at
specific examples and highlighting the parts of the input that contribute most to the final output. In the Grad-CAM method,5 for example,
network gradients are used to produce a coarse localization of drivers of the output. While the method was developed for images, it
works with ECGs as well. In published valvular disease detection algorithms, for example,6,7 the authors use saliency-based methods to
highlight the portions of the ECG that contributed to the model's
output in selected samples. While this is a first step towards developing explainable AI, current methods explain the results for a particular example and do not reveal the general rules used by the models.
This remains an open research question.

in very poor separation of the classes (bottom left). As the area under the curve increases (0.803 middle panel, top and 0.998 right panel, top) the
separation of the classes and utility of the test improves (bottom panels). This results in improved sensitivity and specificity. See text for additional
details.

(AUC 0.93) in a testing population not previously seen by the network (Figure 2).2 In the emergency room setting, LVSD is identified
with similar accuracy (85.9%; AUC 0.89) in patients with symptoms
of an acute HF exacerbation (i.e. dyspnoea on exertion, shortness of
breath).19 At the time of this writing, the algorithm has received US
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) breakthrough technology designation and, during the pandemic, emergency use authorization. The
algorithm and algorithms analogous to ours have been adapted for
use with a single lead, and our own algorithm has been embedded in
an electrode-equipped digital stethoscope that identifies ventricular
dysfunction in 15 s (Figure 4).21,23,37
These algorithms have been tested in diverse populations and
found to function well across race and ethnicity.15,16,20
Artificial intelligence algorithms may experience dataset shift
errors when applied to previously untested environments. These
errors occur when the new populations differ from those used to
train the network in a substantive manner so that the network has
not been exposed to key data characteristics required for accurate
output. Artificial intelligence ECG networks for the detection of
LVSD, developed by our team and Cho et al., have demonstrated
performance stability and robustness with regards to sex, age, and
body mass index in internal and external validation sets,18,22,23 supporting wide applicability. Prospective application of this AI ECG algorithm in various clinical settings is essential to establish the
accuracy of LVSD diagnosis in a real-world setting and the impact on
clinical decision-making, and is discussed further below.36

Artificial intelligence
electrocardiogram to detect
silent atrial fibrillation
Atrial fibrillation is often paroxysmal, asymptomatic, and elusive. It is
associated with stroke, heart failure, and mortality.14,38 In patients
with embolic stroke of uncertain source, the choice of anti-platelet
vs. anticoagulant therapy depends on the absence or presence of AF.
Holter monitors and 14- to 30-day mobile cardiac outpatient telemetry have a low yield, leading to the use of implanted loops recorders,
which find AF less in <15% of patients at 1 year.38,39 Clinical risk
scores and electronic medical record-based ML tools have had limited power to predict AF.3,28
Since neural networks can detect multiple, subtle, non-linearrelated patterns in an ECG, we hypothesized that they may be able
to detect the presence of intermittent AF from an NSR ECG
recorded before or after an AF episode, as patients with AF may
have subclinical ECG changes associated with fibrosis or transient
physiologic changes. To test this hypothesis, we utilized 1 million
ECGs from patients with no AF (controls) and patients with episodic
AF (cases). The network was never shown ECGs with AF, but only
NSR ECGs from patients with episodic AF and from controls. After
training, the AI ECG network accurately detected paroxysmal AF
from an ECG recorded during NSR (accuracy of 79.4%; AUC 0.87).3

prior to first ECG showing AF) was evaluated, the accuracy of the AI
ECG algorithm improved (83.3%; AUC 0.9).3 As noted in a letter to
the editor, there were differences in the AF vs. no AF populations.40
This algorithm was subsequently tested as a predictor of AF compared to the CHARGE-AF (cohorts for ageing and research in genomic epidemiology-AF) score.41 The incidence of AF predicted by
each model-AI ECG AF probability and CARGE-AF score-was
assessed in a quartile analysis over time. The cumulative incidence of
AF was greatest in the highest quartile for each method at 10 years
(AI ECG AF 36.1% when AF probability >12.4%; CHARGE-AF 31.4%
when score >14.7).41 Both methods revealed a c-statistic of 0.69 independently (c-statistic 0.72 when combined) indicating that the AI
ECG model can provide a simple means for assessing AF risk without
clinical data abstraction (i.e. CHARGE-AF).41 Importantly, individuals
with AI ECG AF model output of >0.5 at baseline had cumulative incidence of AF 21.5% at 2 years and 52.2% at 10 years, identifying a
high-risk subset.
This work has subsequently been independently confirmed by
others. Raghunath et al.31 used 1.6 M 12 lead ECGs to train a network
that could predict new-onset AF in patients with no AF history (AUC
ROC 0.85, AUC precision-recall curve 0.22). Additionally, multiple
groups have used deep learning algorithms to detect atrial fibrillation
present during recording (non-'silent' AF) using lead, single lead, and
photoplethysmographic devices.27,29,30

proposed for diagnosis, but none have shown consistent diagnostic
performance.42-44 Similarly, previous attempts to detect HCM with
AI application have focused on high-risk patient characteristics,45 specific ECG criteria, or beat-to-beat morphologic ECG features.25
Noteworthy, up to 10% of HCM patients may exhibit a 'normal' ECG
rendering diagnostic criteria and algorithms useless.42-44
The AI ECG is a powerful tool for the detection of HCM, with
high accuracy found from multiple groups.25,34,46 The Mayo Clinic algorithm maintained its robust accuracy when the testing group was
narrowed to patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) ECG
criteria (AUC 0.95) and 'normal ECG' by manual interpretation
(AUC 0.95), as found by others.25,34 This implies that the AI ECG algorithm does not the typical ECG characteristics associated with
HCM for diagnosis.13,47 Importantly, the AI ECG effectively differentiates 'normal ECG' findings, from LVH and benign LVH-like ECG features related to athletic training.
Lastly, we identified the potential for cost-effective HCM screening
as the NPV of the model remained high at all probability thresholds
(NPV 98-99%).13 Appropriate deployment of this test could provide
reassurance to patients, prevent unnecessary, expensive diagnostic
workup associated with manual interpretation, and the clinical conundrum of the athletic heart vs. HCM, resulting in improved utilization of healthcare resources.

Artificial intelligence for

as long QT syndrome (LQTS) and Brugada syndrome exhibit incomplete penetrance: disease expression and severity in individuals even

from the same family and carrying the same mutation can be very different. As diagnosis is based primarily upon the ECG phenotype, the
potential for human misinterpretation and mismeasurement is
significant.
Artificial intelligence therefore offers the opportunity for more reliable measurement of diagnostic markers and then the ability to recognize the diagnosis when expression is incomplete or even absent.
This may result from the ability of neural networks to classify subtle
morphologic ECG changes. The best exemplar is measurement of
the QT interval and diagnosis of the LQTS. A deep neural network
(DNN) was trained on ECGs from 250 767 patients, tested on a further 107 920 and then validated on a further 179 513, using the institutional ECG repository with the cardiologist over-read QTc as the
gold standard. There was strong agreement in the test set between
the gold standard and the DNN predicted value. Furthermore, when
tested against a prospective genetic heart disease clinic population
including LQTS patients, the DNN performed just as robustly. The
DNN relied upon a two lead ECG input and was therefore also
tested against an input from a mobile ECG device with excellent concordance. For a cut-off of QTc >500 ms, a strong diagnostic and risk
marker for the likelihood of LQTS, the AUC was 0.97, with sensitivity
and specificity of 80.0%, and 94.4%, respectively, indicating strong utility as a screening method.
Even when the QTc is normal, concealed LQTS has been detectable by computerized analysis of T-wave morphology. A DNN has
been applied to the whole ECG from all patients from the genetic
heart disease clinic (N = 2059) with a diagnosis of LQTS and those

who were seen and then discharged without a diagnosis. The QTc
interval alone identified patients with LQTS and a QTc <450 ms
compared to patients without LQTS with an AUC of 0.741. The AI
algorithm increased the AUC to 0.863 and also distinguished genetic
subtypes of LQTS, offering potential as a tool to guide evaluation in
the clinic.
Other opportunities include the diagnosis of concealed Brugada
syndrome, which is made using sodium channel blocker challenge.
Artificial intelligence could potentially avoid the process of drug challenge. Furthermore, risk stratification is heavily dependent on and
limited by ECG markers that are only visually interpretable. Artificial
intelligence algorithms may identify markers from the ECG that
would otherwise go undetected.

Artificial intelligence valvular
heart disease
Early diagnosis of valvular diseases such as aortic stenosis (AS) and
mitral regurgitation (MR) permits prevention of irreversible damage.
A growing body of data supports early treatment, including in asymptomatic patients.48 Current screening methods rely on expert examination and auscultation that prompt echocardiography. With the
adoption of echocardiography in practice, auscultation is in decline,49
resulting in a need for improved screening. The AI ECG detects moderate-severe AS, as reported by two independent groups, with AUC
of 0.87-0.9.6,7 Using echocardiography as the ground truth, Cohen-

Shelly et al.6 found that the AI ECG also predicted future development of severe AS, prior to clinical manifestation. Kwon et al.35 have
demonstrated a similar yield in screening for moderate to severe MR
(AUC: 0.88). These algorithms, developed independently using two
geographically and racially diverse populations, highlight potential for
the AI ECG to detect valvular diseases at earlier stages, even when
tested using a single ECG lead and in asymptomatic patients. The use
of mobile form factors to acquire ECGs that can be augmented by AI
makes the test available at point of care and massively scalable; in
combination with percutaneous and novel treatments for valvular
lesions, a significant potential exists to improve patient outcomes in a
scalable and cost-efficient way.

Validation in practice
Artificial intelligence in medicine has been predominantly developed
and tested in silico, using large aggregates of medical records containing analysable medical information. However, in order for AI to have
a meaningful impact on human health, it must be applied and integrated in medical workflows, and used to treat patients. Differences
between the training population and applied population, lack of use
of AI output by clinicians who may not trust, understand, or easily access the information impact real-world effectiveness of AI. Several
studies have explicitly tested this. The EAGLE study50 and Yao et al.36
were a pragmatic clustered trial study that randomized 120 primary
care teams including 358 clinicians to an intervention group (access
to AI screening results, 181 clinicians) or control (usual care, 177
clinicians), across 48 clinics/hospitals. A total of 22 641 adult patients
who had an ECG performed for any indication between August 5,
2019, and March 31, 2020, without prior heart failure were included.

3 months. The proportion of patients with a positive result was similar between groups (6.0% vs. 6.0%). Among patients with a positive
screening result, a high percentage of intervention patients received
echocardiograms (38.1% for control and 49.6% for intervention,
P < 0.001). The AI screening tool also increase the diagnosis of low
EF from 1.6% in the control group to 2.1% in the intervention group,
odds ratio 1.32, P = 0.007. This study highlighted a number of important points. The AI ECG integrated into primary care improved the
diagnosis of low EF. This study found that the environment in which
the algorithm was used impacted its performance, with a higher yield
whose ECGs were obtained in outpatient clinics compared to those
who were hospitalized. This may potentially reflect a higher probability of undiagnosed low EF patients in outpatient settings. Another important finding is that the performance of the intervention was highly
dependent on clinician adoption of the recommendation. Among
patients with a positive screening result, the intervention increased
the percentage of patients receiving an echocardiogram from 38.1%
to 49.6%, indicating that a large number of clinicians did not respond
to the AI recommendation. Many of the decisions to forgo echocardiography were based on logical clinical reasoning such as a patient
undergoing palliative care in whom additional diagnostic testing was
not needed. Nonetheless, the study highlighted the impact of AI both
in its capability of identifying undiagnosed disease and the importance
of the use of clinical judgement, as with any tool. Importantly, this trial
of over 20 000 patients was executed rapidly and inexpensively, highlighting the ability to rigorously and effectively assess AI tools developed in a pragmatic manner due to the tool's software foundation,
allowing for rapid design development and iteration.

Use of the AI ECG

New opportunities and
implications
High school athlete and large-scale
screening
As alluded to above, the AI ECG has the potential to measure and detect ECG markers for cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia syndromes,
automatically and more effectively than humans, including the use of
mobile ECG devices. This may have specific utility in the screening of
young people to exclude risk prior to participation in sports.
Objections to employing the ECG in the screening algorithm include
issues of cost, false positives and negatives, and the lack of experts to
read ECGs to minimize false positives.51 Artificial intelligence may be
able to address these concerns but requires a large dataset with linkage to outcomes to test the hypothesis.

Concept of artificial intelligence disease
'previvors'
The AI ECG identifies LVSD in some individuals with normal imaging
findings and no manifest disease. However, those individuals with apparent false positive AI ECG findings have a five-fold increased risk of
developing ventricular dysfunction over the ensuing 5 years.2 This
raises the possibilities that with sufficient data AI tools may predict
who will develop a disease, leading to the concept of disease 'previvors'-individuals who are healthy but have a markedly elevated predisposition to develop a disease (Figure 5). This concept was similarly
evident with other AI ECG models.41 This raises issues of preventive
interventions and their potential risks, patient anxiety, and insurance
coverage, data privacy and larger societal issues that must be considered as increasingly powerful AI tools are developed.

Data sharing and privacy

neural networks and other AI models require large and high-quality

datasets.52,53 In some cases, there is not a single institution with sufficient data to train an accurate AI model, and data from multiple institutions is required. Sharing data among institutions introduces a risk
of disclosing including protected health information. Sharing identified
health information without proper approval is unethical,54 risks eroding trust in health care institutions, and violates national and international laws, including HIPAA in the USA55 and GDPR in Europe56
To avoid infringing on patient privacy and to comply with regulations,
data are often de-identified. While this reduces the risk of re-identification, recent research showed that data that appear de-identified to
humans often continues to embed patient information, which can be
extracted and reconstituted. Packhauser et al. have shown that in an
open dataset containing supposably de-identified chest X-ray images,
using an AI similarity model, images from the same patient could be
identified even when acquired 10 years or more from one another
(AUC of 0.994). While their method required additional medical
data to re-identify patients, this is not always the case. Schwarz et al.
were able to reconstruct subject faces using an anonymized magnetic
resonance imaging dataset from the three-dimensional data and to
then match the faces to subject photographs, with an accuracy of
84%. While these methods require access to multiple data sources,
they highlight data exposure risks. Therefore, we envision that data
sharing will be replaced with privacy preserving methods that reduce
the probability of re-identification significantly in the very near future.
The most common technique to allow training of AI models without sharing data is federated learning,57 an approach that trains a single model in a de-centralized fashion (Figure 6). Rather than sending
data to a single location, each site with private data uses a local training node that only sees its own data. The output from each local
node-which is no longer interpretable-is then sent to a main node
that aggregates the knowledge and consolidates it to a single model
without having access to the original raw data. A second method that
allows training of a model with privacy in mind is differential privacy
(DP).58 Instead of using raw data directly, the data are shared with
added noise, allowing the data contributor to blend in a sea of data
contributors. To prevent noise averaging out with the addition of
data from a given individual, the amount of information contributed
from one person is limited (privacy budget). A common use case for
DP is smartphone keyboard suggestions. By adding noise and limiting
the number of contributions from a single user, smartphones can predict of the next word or emoji a user will type, but without disclosing
all the user's previous conversations.59 A third privacy preserving
method mostly used for inference using a pre-trained model is secure
multi party computation. In this method, only an encrypted portion
of each data sample is shared, each part of the data is analysed separately, and the results are combined in a secured way, allowing data
analysis without sending any complete samples.

Conclusion
The ECG is rich in physiologic information that is unique, identifying,
and encodes many health conditions. Since ionic currents are frequently affected very early in many disease processes, the addition of
AI to a standard ECG-a ubiquitous, inexpensive, test that requires
no body fluids or reagents-transforms it into a powerful diagnostic
screening tool that may also permit monitoring and assessment of

(acquired at a previous visit to the clinic), a separate natural language
processing AI algorithm screens the patient record to determine anticoagulation eligibility based on the CHADS-VASc score and bleeding
risk. Those individuals found to have silent atrial fibrillation by the AI
ECG screen who would benefit from anticoagulation are invited to
enrol in a study via an electronic portal message. Study participants
are monitored for 30 days using a wearable monitor. This trial is ongoing, and the results are pending. However, instances of individuals
previously not known to have atrial fibrillation (despite many NSR
ECGs) have been identified, clinical atrial fibrillation has been subsequently recorded with prospective ambulatory monitoring, and following consultation, anticoagulation initiated. This trial seeks to
demonstrate how the AI ECG may improve our systematic clinical
capabilities, eliminate variability resulting from the random chance of
capturing a time-limited arrhythmia with standard ECG recordings
and variations in clinical knowledge among practitioners to comprehensively find individuals who may benefit from evidence-based
stroke prevention therapies.

response to therapy. When coupled to smartphones, it enables a
massively scalable point of care test. Like any test, clinicians will need
to understand when and how to use it in order to best care for
patients.
