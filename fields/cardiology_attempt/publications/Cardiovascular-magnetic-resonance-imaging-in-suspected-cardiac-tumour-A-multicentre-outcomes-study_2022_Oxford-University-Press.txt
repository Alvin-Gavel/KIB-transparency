Aims

Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is a key diagnostic tool for the evaluation of patients with suspected cardiac tumours. Patient management is guided by the CMR diagnosis, including no further testing if a mass
is excluded or if only a pseudomass is found. However, there are no outcomes studies validating this approach.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
In this multicentre study of patients undergoing clinical CMR for suspected cardiac tumour, CMR diagnoses were
and results
assigned as no mass, pseudomass, thrombus, benign tumour, or malignant tumour. A final diagnosis was determined
after follow-up using all available data. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. Among 903 patients, the
CMR diagnosis was no mass in 25%, pseudomass in 16%, thrombus in 16%, benign tumour in 17%, and malignant
tumour in 23%. Over a median of 4.9 years, 376 patients died. Compared with the final diagnosis, the CMR diagnosis was accurate in 98.4% of patients. Patients with CMR diagnoses of pseudomass and benign tumour had similar
mortality to those with no mass, whereas those with malignant tumour [hazard ratio (HR) 3.31 (2.40-4.57)] and
thrombus [HR 1.46 (1.00-2.11)] had greater mortality. The CMR diagnosis provided incremental prognostic value
over clinical factors including left ventricular ejection fraction, coronary artery disease, and history of extracardiac
malignancy (P < 0.001).

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
In patients with suspected cardiac tumour, CMR has high diagnostic accuracy. Patients with CMR diagnoses of no
mass, pseudomass, and benign tumour have similar long-term mortality. The CMR diagnosis is a powerful independent predictor of mortality incremental to clinical risk factors.

Introduction
Expert consensus documents recommend cardiovascular magnetic
resonance (CMR) imaging as a key diagnostic tool in the evaluation of
patients with suspected cardiac tumours.1-3 Patient management is
often guided by the CMR diagnosis, including anticoagulation if a
thrombus is found and no further testing if a mass is excluded or if
only a pseudomass-a prominent normal structure or common variant-is detected. However, the American College of Cardiology
Foundation Expert Consensus Document on CMR, while indicating
that CMR is 'appropriate' for the evaluation of a suspected cardiac
mass, recognizes that 'no existing guidelines are established for the
evaluation of a cardiac mass with CMR'.2 This statement likely
reflects, in part, the dearth of evidence demonstrating the prognostic
value of CMR for this purpose.
Investigations to date of the use of CMR in the evaluation of cardiac masses have several limitations. Nearly all are small single-centre
studies that typically focus on imaging characteristics and the diagnostic accuracy of CMR for differentiating between various types of
cardiac tumours.4-8 Often, studies only include patients with
pathology-proven cardiac tumours,4,6,8-10 yet these represent only a
small fraction of patients with suspected cardiac tumours who undergo CMR.
There is a paucity of studies of patients with suspected cardiac tumour that correlate the imaging diagnosis with outcomes. For example, although CMR is widely used to exclude a cardiac mass, there
are no studies with systematic follow-up of patients in whom a

.. Study design and cohort
.. Four geographically diverse medical centres in the USA participated in

..
.. NC, USA) as described previously.11 The cloud-based system contained

Between January 2003 and December 2014, consecutive patients

In patients with suspected cardiac tumour, CMR has high diagnostic accuracy and is an excellent independent predictor of long-term mortality.

CMR in suspected cardiac tumour

Cardiovascular magnetic resonance protocol
Patients were scanned on 1.5 or 3 T scanners (Siemens, Malvern, PA,
USA) with phased array coil systems. Sites used the same standardized
protocol as described by the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic
Resonance (SCMR).12-14 The SCMR protocol comprises (i) steady-state
free precession (SSFP) cine imaging, (ii) bright-blood (SSFP) and darkblood (HASTE) single-shot morphological imaging, (iii) T1- and
T2-weighted fast spin-echo imaging with and without fat saturation, (iv)
first-pass perfusion imaging during the administration of gadolinium contrast, and (v) two sets of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) imaging:
one with inversion time set to null normal myocardium and the other
with inversion time set longer (long-TI LGE) to null thrombus (500-
550 ms at 1.5 T, 850-900 ms at 3 T).13-17 Also, as described by the SCMR
protocol,13,14 optional sequences such as post-contrast cine imaging
(often helpful for small mobile masses) and serial LGE imaging (to distinguish hypoperfused tumour necrotic core from thrombus) were performed as needed. Specific details of the CMR pulse sequences are
provided in Supplementary material online.

Cardiovascular magnetic resonance
diagnosis and final diagnosis
Experienced CMR physicians (all with SCMR-Level III training) at each
participating centre performed clinical interpretations within 1 day following CMR. An algorithm of the approach to interpretation used by the
physicians is provided in Figure 1. In brief, the interpretation was based on
conventional imaging features described in the literature;9,18,19 however,
a stepwise approach was emphasized with certain diagnoses more dependent on specific CMR techniques than others. For example, differentiating thrombus from tumour (e.g. Figure 1 'Step 2') was based on long-TI
LGE images.
Exclusion of a cardiac mass ('no mass') required the absence of a mass
or any structure that could have been mistaken for a mass on prior imaging. A 'pseudomass' was diagnosed when physicians noted a prominent
normal structure (Eustachian valve, crista terminalis, etc.), a variant of a
normal structure (lipomatous hypertrophy of the interatrial septum, epicardial fat, etc.), or a non-mass pathology (hiatal hernia) that could have
been mistaken for a cardiac mass on prior imaging. A thrombus was diagnosed based on its location within the cardiac cavity, and tissue characteristics consistent with a homogeneous, avascular mass. This determination
was made on post-contrast LGE images obtained with a long inversion
time showing a homogeneously dark mass with no contrast uptake. A tumour was diagnosed and determined to be benign or malignant, based on
general features such as location (intracavitary, intramural, or epicardial),

.. morphology (rounded, irregular), border definition at the interface with
..
.. the normal myocardium (well-defined, infiltrating), perfusion characteris.. tics (hypoperfused, hypervascular), and late contrast uptake (homoge..
.. neous, heterogeneous), as well as sequence-specific characteristics,
.. suggesting that the mass was composed of fat (fat suppression sequences)
..
.. or cystic fluid (T1 and/or T2 weighting consistent with fluid).
..
To assess the accuracy of the CMR diagnosis, all participating centres
.. were instructed to determine a 'final diagnosis' for each patient using all
..
.. available clinical data during the follow-up period, including follow-up
.. imaging studies, pathology data, clinical course, and outcome. In patients
..
.. with CMR diagnoses of no mass or pseudomass, follow-up included de.. termination of whether a thrombus or tumour was later diagnosed.
.. Similarly, follow-up in cases of thrombus included determination of re..
.. sponse to anticoagulation, such as resolution of the mass. When available,
.. the pathology diagnosis of the cardiac mass was assumed as the reference
..
.. standard.
..
..
.. Data coordinating centre and core lab
.. interpretations
..
.. The data coordinating centre verified the completeness of data submitted
.. by the participating sites. An investigator at the centre reviewed clinical
..
.. reports on the CloudCMR system and assigned each study patient to one
.. of the five categories based on the clinical CMR interpretation: (i) no
..
.. mass, (ii) pseudomass, (iii) thrombus, (iv) benign tumour, and (v) malig.. nant tumour. Diagnoses that did not fit into any of the first five categories
.. were categorized as 'Other'. The assignment was done blinded to all clin..
.. ical data after the CMR, including mass-directed clinical management and
.. outcome. In patients interpreted to have pseudomass or benign tumour,
..
.. the specific type was noted. In patients diagnosed to have thrombus, the
.. location was noted. Specific types of malignant tumours were not catego.. rized since CMR features of different malignant tumours overlap signifi..
.. cantly, and the clinical history of an extracardiac malignancy often guides
.. the interpretation of the specific type of malignant cardiac tumour. In
..
.. instances where thrombus was noted covering or overlying a tumour,
.. the CMR diagnosis was tumour. Tumours with variable aggressiveness
.. (thymoma, carcinoid, etc.) were classified as malignant based on the impli..
.. cation for patient management.
..
To test the 'stand-alone' value of CMR interpretations independent of
..
.. all associated clinical information, centralized core lab interpretations
.. were made in a random subgroup of 200 study patients. Two expert
..
.. investigators at the data coordinating centre reviewed CMR images on
.. the CloudCMR system blinded to the clinical report and all other clinical
.. data, and by consensus assigned patients to one of the categories. Cases
..
.. of no mass and pseudomass were categorized together as 'no mass-or.. pseudomass' because pre-CMR clinical information may increase the like..
.. lihood of a CMR diagnosis of pseudomass. For instance, the knowledge
.. that CMR was requested for a tumour suspected along the posterior wall
.. of the right atrium increases the likelihood that a physician would inter..
.. pret a prominent crista terminalis as pseudomass, whereas a physician
.. blinded to that information is more likely to interpret the CMR as show..
.. ing no mass.
..
..
.. Statistical analyses
.. Continuous, normally distributed data were expressed as mean +/- stand.. ard deviation, and between-group comparisons were made using
..
.. two-sample t-tests. The median and the interquartile range were used to
.. summarize non-normally distributed, continuous data, and between..
.. group comparisons were made using Wilcoxon tests. Comparisons of
.. discrete variables between groups were made using v2 test or Fisher's
.. exact test. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses and Cox proportional hazards
..
. regression analyses were used to evaluate the relationships between

Data available in the cloud-based system were supplemented by additional data collection at each participating site. This included a comprehensive medical history at the time of the CMR study and data collected
during follow-up including details of clinical management (e.g. anticoagulation therapy, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, surgery) and pathology
results from either biopsy or surgical specimens. In patients found to have
either no mass or a pseudomass by CMR, follow-up clinical data were
reviewed (including follow-up imaging studies if performed) to determine
if patients were subsequently diagnosed with a cardiac mass. Patients
were also followed for the primary endpoint of all-cause mortality. The
cloud-based system included mortality data, which was automatically
determined every 3 months by comparing patient identifiers (only available locally) to the US Social Security Death Index. Where available, the
Social Security Death Index mortality data were supplemented with information from other locally available data sources such as the hospital
electronic medical record and the state's vital records department. Data
collection ended in December 2018.

by plotting the scaled Schoenfeld residuals for each independent variable

variables included in the multivariable models. All tests were two-tailed.
A P-value of <0.05 was used to denote statistical significance. Analyses
were performed using R, version 3.4 (R Foundation for Statistical
Computing, Vienna, Austria).

Results
The study cohort consisted of 935 consecutive adult patients from
four centres (Duke University Medical Center, n = 384; Houston
Methodist Hospital, n = 266; University of Minnesota Medical Center,
n = 171; and Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center,
n = 114). Thirty-two (3%) patients had a CMR diagnosis of 'Other'
(Supplementary material online, Table S1). Among these, 14 had
valve-associated vegetations, but otherwise, the possible diagnoses
were heterogeneous, and these 32 patients were excluded from further analyses.

accounting for 66% of all cases (Supplementary material online, Table
S2).
Patients with cardiac thrombus formed the youngest group, with
the lowest proportion of women, the lowest mean LVEF, and the
highest prevalence of CAD. Thrombus was most often located in the
left ventricle (50%) and right atrium (34%) (Supplementary material
online, Table S3). Patients with right atrial thrombus were more likely
to have a diagnosis of extracardiac malignancy than those with left
ventricular thrombus (41% vs. 10%; P < 0.001). Approximately 20%
of patients in each of the diagnostic groups of no mass, pseudomass,
and thrombus had extracardiac malignancy; yet despite this high
prevalence of extracardiac malignancy, a cardiac tumour was
excluded by CMR in these diagnostic groups.
Patients with a CMR diagnosis of benign tumour were disproportionately female (68%) whereas those with malignant tumour were
evenly distributed by sex (46% women). The most common types of
benign tumour were myxomas (42%), papillary fibroelastomas (23%),
and pericardial cysts (22%) (Supplementary material online, Table S4).
The benign (cardiac) tumour group had the lowest rate of extracardiac malignancy (15%). While patients with a CMR diagnosis of malignant (cardiac) tumour had the highest prevalence of extracardiac
malignancy, notably, 26% of this cohort had no known extracardiac
malignancy at the time of CMR.

Clinical follow-up and final diagnoses
Patients were followed for a median of 4.9 years (interquartile range
1.6-7.3 years) with a total of 4285 patient-years of follow-up.
Pathology of the cardiac mass was available in 226 patients, representing 47% of those with a CMR diagnosis of benign tumour and
60% of those with a CMR diagnosis of malignant tumour. The final
diagnosis using all available clinical data during the follow-up period
was no mass in 235, pseudomass in 149, thrombus in 145, benign tumour in 164, and malignant tumour in 210. The most common malignant tumours were sarcoma, lymphoma, and melanoma
(Supplementary material online, Table S5).

The CMR diagnosis was accurate in 98.4% (889/903) of patients
compared against the final diagnosis. The 14 patients with discordant
CMR and final diagnoses are listed in Table 2. The lone patient with
an incorrect CMR diagnosis of no mass had a small mobile mass with
chaotic motion attached to the mitral valve chordal apparatus on
echocardiography. The CMR report noted that although the small
mass was not visualized, this was likely because of motion averaging.
The patient subsequently had surgery that revealed a left ventricular
papillary fibroelastoma. The CMR diagnosis of pseudomass was concordant with the final diagnosis in all cases. All four patients with an
incorrect CMR diagnosis of thrombus had a final diagnosis of benign
tumour, three of whom were myxomas. Of the five patients with an
incorrect CMR diagnosis of benign tumour, two were believed to
have myxoma but were found to have thrombus on the final diagnosis; two others had a final diagnosis of malignant tumour; however,
the specific diagnoses of carcinoid tumour and teratoma have variable malignant potential. All four patients with an incorrect CMR
diagnosis of malignant tumour had a final diagnosis of benign tumour,
two of whom were haemangiomas that were hypervascular on perfusion imaging. Among 518 patients with a final diagnosis of thrombus
or tumour, the long-TI sequence (Figure 1, 'Step 2') was accurate in
98.7% (512/519) in distinguishing thrombus from tumour. Among
374 patients with a final diagnosis of tumour, CMR was accurate in
98.4% (368/374) in distinguishing benign from malignant (Figure 1,
'Steps 3 and 4').
Mass-directed clinical management following CMR is detailed in
Supplementary material online, Table S6. Eleven patients with a CMR
diagnosis of pseudomass underwent surgical biopsy, which confirmed
the CMR diagnosis. Most patients with a CMR diagnosis of thrombus
received anticoagulation therapy (94%). Only patients with a CMR
diagnosis of malignant tumour received chemotherapy and radiation
therapy, but 12% had no cardiac tumour-specific treatment because
of advanced disease.
In the subgroup of 200 patients with CMR interpretations that
were performed blinded to all clinical information, there was high

concordance between the interpretations with no clinical information and both the clinical CMR diagnosis and the final diagnosis (95%
and 94% concordance, respectively; Supplementary material online,
Table S7).

Long-term prognostic value and the
incremental value of cardiovascular
magnetic resonance
During follow-up, 376 patients died. Kaplan-Meier analysis (Figure 2)
shows that patients with CMR diagnoses of pseudomass and benign
tumour had similar long-term mortality to those with no mass,
whereas those with thrombus and malignant tumour had greater
mortality. The estimated cumulative 5-year mortality rates were 22%
for no mass, 26% for pseudomass, 17% for benign tumour, 36% for
thrombus, and 73% for malignant tumour.
On Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, age [hazard ratio
(HR) 1.09 (95% confidence interval 1.04-1.13) per 5-year increase],
smoking [HR 1.37 (1.11-1.69)], CMR LVEF [HR 1.05 (1.01-1.10) per
5% decrease], extracardiac malignancy [HR 2.32 (1.81-2.97)], CMR
diagnosis of thrombus [HR 1.46 (1.00-2.11) relative to CMR diagnosis of no mass], and CMR diagnosis of malignant tumour [HR 3.31
(2.40-4.57) relative to CMR diagnosis of no mass] were independently associated with mortality (Table 3).
Patients with extracardiac malignancy compared to those without
had different clinical variables associated with mortality. Only smoking predicted mortality in patients with extracardiac malignancy,
whereas age, hyperlipidaemia, smoking, and CMR LVEF predicted
mortality in patients without extracardiac malignancy. The CMR diagnosis of malignant tumour was predictive of mortality in both groups.
The addition of the CMR diagnosis to a clinical model lacking the
CMR diagnosis significantly increased the v2 statistic from 215.8 to
299.8 (P < 0.001) demonstrating incremental value. The CMR

diagnosis had incremental value also in both patients with and without extracardiac malignancy.

Discussion
Cardiovascular magnetic resonance is one of the most used techniques for the assessment of patients with suspected cardiac tumours.
While contemporary CMR can provide impressive anatomic, functional, and tissue characterization, there remains a large evidence gap
between the demonstration of the feasibility of imaging and the demonstration of clinical benefit to patients. With concerns about the
cost and the availability of CMR, outcomes data are essential to establish the value of CMR guidance for decision-making in these
patients and to inform policymakers, clinicians, and patients.
The present study is the largest imaging study to date for the diagnosis of cardiac tumour and confirms the high accuracy of CMR previously reported in smaller cohorts in whom cardiac tumours were
known to be present.5-8 More importantly, we found that CMR also
has high accuracy in excluding a cardiac tumour. The significance of
this finding is demonstrated by the observation that nearly half the
CMRs (385/903) were requested to evaluate a suspected tumour in
patients later found to have either no mass or pseudomass.
However, proving that a tumour is truly absent, or is being mimicked
by a pseudomass is inherently problematic, in part because such
patients will not usually undergo biopsy or have pathology confirmation. In the absence of tissue confirmation, proving that CMR can be
relied upon to definitively exclude a cardiac tumour required the
multiyear follow-up performed in the present study. Our mean
follow-up of nearly 5 years seems sufficient for any significant cardiac
tumour to become apparent. Only a single small benign tumour (papillary fibroelastoma) not seen by CMR was later found during the
4285 patient-years of follow-up. These data validate for the first time
the clinical practice of using CMR to exclude a cardiac tumour.
In patients in whom a mass was present, CMR offers a unique ability to differentiate between various diagnostic possibilities, particularly thrombus vs. tumour. One important aspect of our study was the
systematic investigation of the long-TI sequence (Figure 1, 'Step 2'), a
technique originally validated by Weinsaft et al.,15 and recommended
in the standardized SCMR protocols to distinguish between thrombus and tumour,13,14 although there are limited data supporting this
recommendation. Thrombus, owing to its avascular nature, is low in
signal intensity on long-TI images and is readily differentiated from a
neoplasm that has a vascular supply. In the present study, we found
that the long-TI sequence was highly accurate (98.7%; 512/519) in distinguishing thrombus from tumour. The few inaccuracies were almost entirely in cases of myxomas mistaken for thrombi, or vice
versa, because of the overlap in rare cases of imaging findings common to both. Specifically, the avascular appearance of thrombus may
be mimicked by a rare gelatinous myxoma with no discernible vascularized stalk.21 Given its ease of use, it should be noted that long-TI
imaging can be implemented on any CMR-capable scanner, without
requiring additional software or hardware.
Cardiovascular magnetic resonance also correctly distinguished
benign from malignant tumours, owing to its excellent soft tissue contrast and high spatial resolution. Notably, this distinction was highly
accurate (98.4%; 368/374), even though many patients had a history

of extracardiac malignancy, which would seemingly increase the odds
of a cardiac mass being malignant. Almost 20% of patients in each of
the CMR diagnostic groups of no mass, pseudomass, and thrombus
had a history of extracardiac malignancy but were nonetheless correctly diagnosed. These data show that many patients with known
malignancy are referred for CMR to evaluate a finding suggestive of
cardiac involvement and that CMR can reliably exclude such
involvement.
Outcomes data from our study demonstrate that patients with
CMR diagnoses of no mass, pseudomass, and benign tumour have a
similar prognosis. Although there are no prior studies with long-term
follow-up of patients deemed to have either no mass or pseudomass,
the 5-year mortality in our patients with benign tumours was 17%,
like previous reports.22 Patients with a CMR diagnosis of malignant
tumour had a significantly worse prognosis. Five-year mortality rates
of 83-89% have been reported in cancer registry studies of primary
malignant cardiac tumours.23,24 Our lower 5-year mortality rate of
73% likely reflects improvements in survival rates over time, as has
been noted in these registries.24 Patients with a CMR diagnosis of

thrombus had an outcome intermediate between those with benign
tumour and those with malignant tumour. The worse prognosis relative to those with benign tumour likely reflects the finding that these
patients frequently had coexisting CAD and decreased LVEF.16
Little data exist on independent predictors of mortality in patients
with suspected cardiac tumours, beyond the tumour type itself. We
found that age, smoking, CMR LVEF, and extracardiac malignancy
were independently associated with long-term mortality in the study
cohort. Whereas age, hyperlipidaemia, smoking, and CMR LVEF predicted mortality in the subgroup of patients without extracardiac malignancy-as might be expected since these are known risk factors
for early mortality in many general populations-only smoking was
associated with long-term mortality in the subgroup with extracardiac
malignancy. The latter was likely secondary to a variety of factors,
including early mortality in those with extracardiac malignancy, the
virulence of smoking-related malignant tumours, a higher rate of tumour treatment failure in smokers, an increased risk of second primary cancers known to be caused by smoking,25 and cardiovascular
disease. Importantly, the addition of the CMR diagnosis to a clinical

model without the CMR diagnosis demonstrated incremental prognostic value for the whole cohort, and in both sub-cohorts of patients
with and without extracardiac malignancy.

Limitations

Conclusions
In patients with suspected cardiac tumour, CMR has high diagnostic
accuracy. The CMR diagnosis is a powerful predictor of mortality and
is incremental to common clinical risk factors (Graphical Abstract).
Our findings provide the first large-scale validation of a CMR-based
approach to evaluate patients with suspected cardiac tumours.

We included patients referred for a clinical CMR and did not perform
a head-to-head comparison of echocardiography vs. CMR in all
comers with suspected cardiac tumour. Therefore, we do not have
data on patients who may have had a definitive diagnosis on echocardiography and did not require a CMR. Nonetheless, our study
describes a real-life cohort that exists in clinical practice, that is
patients with a suspected cardiac tumour where echocardiography
and/or other imaging results are equivocal or incomplete, necessitating a CMR. We also do not have data regarding primary malignant vs.
metastatic tumours. Our primary endpoint was all-cause mortality,
and we did not account for the cause of death. Thus, not all deaths
were necessarily related to cardiac tumours. However, all-cause
mortality is an important and appropriate study endpoint because it
is objective, clinically relevant, and unbiased, which is often not the
case for cause-specific mortality.26 While T1 and T2 mapping techniques likely provide additional tissue characterization of cardiac
masses, the techniques were not clinically available for most of the
study period. It is also important to note that T1 and T2 mapping are
unlikely to add significantly to the key pathways by which CMR already provides value, namely the determination of whether a mass is
present or absent and the delineation between thrombus and tumour ('Steps 1 and 2' in the Stepwise Algorithm). Moreover, CMR as
performed in our study appears effective in distinguishing between
benign and malignant tumours. This is highlighted by the high accuracy of CMR despite the lack of T1 and T2 mapping in our protocol,
where T1 and T2 mapping may help us in identifying specific subtypes
of benign or malignant tumours since some tumours such as melanoma often have unique T1 or T2 characteristics. This needs to be
investigated in future studies.
