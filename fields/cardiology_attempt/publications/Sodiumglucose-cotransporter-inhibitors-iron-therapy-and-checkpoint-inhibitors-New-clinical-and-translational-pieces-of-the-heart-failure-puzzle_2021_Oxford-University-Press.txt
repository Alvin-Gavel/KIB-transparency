This Focus Issue on heart failure and cardiomyopathies contains a
Viewpoint article entitled 'Sodium-glucose co-transporter
inhibitors and heart failure outcomes across different patient populations' by Javed Butler from the University of
Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson, MS, USA, and colleagues.1 The
authors note that hospitalization for heart failure (HF) marks a fundamental change in the natural history of the disease and portends a
poor prognosis for the patients. Butler et al. assess recent trials and
conclude that the success in reducing the risk of a HF events by sodium-glucose co-transporter (SGLT) inhibitors across patient populations to a clinically important and remarkably consistent degree is
not only a moment for celebration, but also an opportunity
for humility, recognizing the serendipity as these strikingly
effective drugs were originally and primarily developed to lower
blood glucose.2-5
Hyperkalaemia is a common complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and limits the optimal use of agents that block the renin-
angiotensin-aldosterone system, particularly in patients with chronic
kidney disease (CKD).6-9 In patients with CKD, SGLT2 inhibitors
provide cardiorenal protection, but whether they affect the risk of
hyperkalaemia remains uncertain. In a Fast Track Clinical Research
article entitled 'Effects of canagliflozin on serum potassium in
people with diabetes and chronic kidney disease: the
CREDENCE trial', Brendon Neuen from UNSW Sydney in
Australia, and colleagues look into this issue further.10 The
CREDENCE trial randomized 4401 participants with T2DM and
CKD to the SGLT2 inhibitor canagliflozin or matching placebo. In this

post-hoc analysis using an intention-to-treat approach, the authors
assessed the effect of canagliflozin on a composite outcome of time
to either investigator-reported hyperkalaemia or the initiation of potassium binders. They also analysed effects on central laboratorydetermined hyper- and hypokalaemia (serum potassium >_6.0 and
<3.5 mmol/L, respectively) and change in serum potassium. The incidence of investigator-reported hyperkalaemia or initiation of potassium binders was lower with canagliflozin than with placebo [hazard
ratio (HR) 0.78, P = 0.014]. Canagliflozin similarly reduced the incidence of laboratory-determined hyperkalaemia (HR 0.77, P = 0.031),
with no effect on the risk of hypokalaemia (HR 0.92, P = 0.53).
Neuen and colleagues conclude that among patients treated with
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibition
with canagliflozin may reduce the risk of hyperkalaemia in people
with T2DM and CKD without increasing the risk of hypokalaemia.
The article is accompanied by an interesting Editorial by Ileana Pi~na
from the Central Michigan University College of Medicine, MI, USA.4
Pi~na notes that the overall results reported are impressive, in that
canagliflozin reduced the risk of investigator-reported hyperkalaemia
or the initiation of potassium binders compared with placebo and extend the findings of other SGLT2 inhibitor studies in patients without
CKD at entry. In addition, Neuen and colleagues have constructed a
'U'-shaped curve for kidney and cardiovascular outcomes that mirror
those of registries and clinical trials, supporting the maintenance of
potassium within normal limits and avoiding both extremes. Finally,
the implications of this study for clinicians caring for patients with diabetes mellitus and CKD should increase confidence in the use of
SGLT2 inhibitors not just to prevent hyperkalaemia, but also to allow
the maintenance of renally protective drugs, now with a new one on
the shelf.

L, Tang WHW, Mullens W. The effect of intravenous ferric carboxymaltose on cardiac reverse remodelling following cardiac resynchronization therapy: the IRON-CRT trial. See pages 4905-4914).

Iron deficiency is common in HF with reduced ejection fraction
(HFrEF) and negatively affects cardiac function and structure. In another Fast Track Clinical Research article, entitled 'The effect of
intravenous ferric carboxymaltose on cardiac reverse
remodelling following cardiac resynchronization therapy:
the IRON-CRT trial', Pieter Martens from the Ziekenhuis OostLimburg hospital in Genk, Belgium, and colleagues study the effect of
ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) on cardiac reverse remodelling and
contractile status in HFrEF.11 Symptomatic HFrEF patients with iron
deficiency and a persistently reduced left ventricular ejection fraction
(LVEF <45%) at least 6 months after cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) implant were prospectively randomized to FCM or standard of care (SOC) in a double-blind manner. The primary endpoint
was the change in LVEF from baseline to 3 month follow-up assessed

by three-dimensional echocardiography. Secondary endpoints
included the change in left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVESV)
and end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) from baseline to 3 month followup. Cardiac performance was evaluated by the force-frequency relationship as assessed by the slope change of the cardiac contractility
index (CCI = systolic blood pressure/LVESV index) at 70, 90, and
110 beats of biventricular pacing. A total of 75 patients were randomized to FCM (n = 37) or SOC (n = 38). After 3 months, the change in
LVEF was significantly higher in the FMC group (4.22%) than in the
SOC group (-0.23; P < 0.001). Similarly, LVESV (-9.72 mL vs.
-1.83 mL; P = 0.001), but not LVEDV (P = 0.748), improved in the
FCM vs. the SOC group. In addition, FCM resulted in an improvement in the CCI slope during incremental biventricular pacing, with a
positive force-frequency relationship at 3 months (Figure 1). Finally,

functional status and exercise capacity, as measured by the Kansas
City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire and peak oxygen consumption,
were improved by FCM.
Martens et al. conclude that treatment with FCM in HFrEF patients
with iron deficiency and persistently reduced LVEF after CRT results
in an improvement of cardiac function measured by LVEF, LVESV,
and cardiac force-frequency relationship. The manuscript is accompanied by an Editorial by Ewa Jankowska and Piotr Ponikowski from
the Wroclaw Medical Institute, and University Hospital in Wroclaw
in Poland.12 The authors conclude that we are currently witnessing a
growing interest in iron deficiency as a therapeutic target in the cardiology world, with the emphasis on HF. Taking into consideration the
critical role of iron in cellular metabolism (in particular in cellular energy metabolism) and close links with inflammatory pathways, one
may expect the contribution of abnormal iron status also to other
cardiovascular diseases and conditions.
In a third Fast Track Clinical Research article entitled 'Prognostic
value of comprehensive intracoronary physiology assessment early after heart transplantation', Jung-Min Ahn from the
University of Ulsan College of Medicine in Seoul, Korea, and colleagues evaluated the long-term prognostic value of invasively assessing coronary physiology after heart transplantation in a large
multicentre registry.13 Comprehensive intracoronary physiology assessment measuring fractional flow reserve (FFR), the index of microcirculatory resistance (IMR), and coronary flow reserve (CFR) was
performed in 254 patients at baseline (a median of 7.2 weeks) and in
240 patients at 1 year after transplantation (199 patients had both
baseline and 1 year measurement). Patients were classified into those
with normal physiology, reduced FFR (FFR <_0.80), and microvascular
dysfunction (either IMR >_25 or CFR <_2.0 with FFR >0.80). The

primary outcome was the composite of death or re-transplantation
at 10 years. At baseline, 5.5% had reduced FFR and 37% had microvascular dysfunction. Baseline reduced FFR [adjusted HR (aHR) 2.33;
P = 0.088] and microvascular dysfunction (aHR 0.88; P = 0.73) were
not predictors of death and re-transplantation at 10 years. At 1 year,
5.0% had reduced FFR and 24% had microvascular dysfunction. Oneyear reduced FFR (aHR 2.98; P = 0.028) and microvascular dysfunction (aHR 2.33; P = 0.015) were associated with significantly increased
risk of death or re-transplantation at 10 years (Figure 2). Invasive
measures of coronary physiology improved the prognostic performance of clinical variables (v2 improvement: 7.41, P = 0.006).
The authors conclude that abnormal coronary physiology 1 year
after heart transplantation was common and was a significant predictor of death or re-transplantation at 10 years. This manuscript is
accompanied by an Editorial by Fernando Alfonso from the
Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, and colleagues.14 The authors
conclude that this is the largest study looking at the prognostic value
of invasive physiological assessment in heart transplantation recipients. Characterization of the physiological phenotype in these
patients provides unique prognostic insights and may pave the way
for additional mechanistic and clinical studies in heart transplantation.
Despite the pathophysiological appeal of intracoronary imaging and
physiological assessment, these techniques, like endomyocardial biopsy, remain invasive strategies. It is tempting to envisage that, one
day, non-invasive assessment of coronary anatomy and physiology
might replace their invasive counterparts to inform clinical decisions
in these challenging patients.
Since 1968, heart transplantation has become the definitive treatment for patients with end-stage HF. In a Clinical Research article

manuscript is accompanied by an Editorial by Gabriele Schiattarella
and David Bode from the Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin in
Germany.18 Schiattarella and Bode conclude that Kondo et al. provided evidence in support of canagliflozin improving NOS coupling
and NADPH oxidase activity through SGLT1/AMPK/Rac1-GTP signalling in the heart. The authors should be congratulated for their
work which suggests a novel role for SGLT1 inhibitors in regulating
myocardial redox signalling and puts SGLT1 in the spotlight of
SGLT(s) research.
The risk and incidence of cardiovascular (CV) immune-related adverse events (irAEs) associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors
(ICIs) is a matter of growing interest.19-25 In a meta-analysis entitled
'Cardiovascular immunotoxicities associated with immune
checkpoint inhibitors: a safety meta-analysis', Charles
Dolladille from Normandie University in Caen, France, and colleagues systematically reviewed all randomized clinical trials (RCTs)
including at least one ICI-containing arm and available CV adverse
event (CVAE) data in cancer patients in the ClinicalTrials.gov registry,
Medline, and the Cochrane CENTRAL Register of Controlled Trials,
up to 31 August 2020 (CRD42020165672).26 The primary outcome
was the summary risk of 16 different CVAEs associated with ICI exposure vs. controls (placebo and non-placebo) in RCTs. ICI use was
associated with an increased risk of six CV irAEs, namely myocarditis,
pericardial diseases, HF, dyslipidaemia, myocardial infarction, and
cerebral arterial ischaemia. with higher risks for myocarditis [odds
ratio (OR) 4.42, P < 0.01)] and dyslipidaemia (OR 3.68, P < 0.01). The
incidence of these CVAEs ranged from 3.2 to 19 per 1000 patients in
studies with a median follow-up ranging from 3.2 to 33 months.
The authors conclude that in RCTs, ICI use is associated with six
CV irAEs, not confined to myocarditis and pericarditis. The manuscript is accompanied by an Editorial by Tomas Neilan from the
Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, MA, USA and Lavanya
Kondapalli from the University of Colorado in Aurora, CO, USA.27
The two conclude that the study of Dolladille et al. elegantly
approaches the difficult question of determining the incidence of cardiac irAES in oncology trials. In addition to the well-known irAEs
myocarditis and pericarditis, they report that ICIs increase the risk of
HF, dyslipidaemia, myocardial infarction, and cerebral arterial ischaemia. Specifically, the finding that ICIs potentiates atherosclerosis is an
important one and an opportunity for cardiologists and oncologists
to expand collaborations with the combined goal of mitigating cardiotoxicity. Additionally, these therapies also provide, in an accelerated
fashion, a remarkable insight into the key role of the immune system
in cardiovascular biology.
The issue is also complemented by two Discussion Forum contributions. In a commentary entitled 'Percutaneous intervention in
patients with cancer: can we offer an improvement in
safety?', I~nigo Lozano from the Hospital de Cabue~nes in Gijon,
Spain, and colleagues comment on the recent publication
'Percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with cancer and readmissions within 90 days for acute myocardial
infarction and bleeding in the USA' by Mamas Andreas Mamas
from Keele University in the UK.28,29 Mamas responds in a separate
comment.30
The editors hope that readers of this issue of the European Heart
Journal will find it of interest.

over five decades', Yuanjia Zhu from the Stanford University
School of Medicine in CA, USA, and colleagues aimed to summarize
their experience in heart transplantation at Stanford University since
the first transplantation performed >50 years ago.15 From 6 January
1968 to 30 November 2020, a total of 2671 patients presented to
Stanford University for heart transplantation, of which 1958 were
adult heart transplantations. Stabilized inverse probability weighting
was applied to compare patients in 1996-2006 (n = 356) vs. 2007-
2019 (n = 515). The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. After
the application of stabilized inverse probability weighting, the distance
the organ travelled increased from 84 miles to 159 miles from 1996-
2006 to 2007-2019. Total allograft ischaemia time also increased
over time (200 vs. 225 min). Patients in 2007-2019 showed superior
survival to those in 1996-2006, with a median survival of 12.1 vs.
11.1 years.
The authors conclude that in this half-century retrospective descriptive study from one of the largest heart transplant programmes
in the USA, long-term survival after heart transplantation has
improved over time despite increased recipient and donor age, worsening comorbidities, increased technical complexity, and prolonged
total allograft ischaemia time. The contribution is accompanied by an
Editorial by Donna Mancini from the Icahn School of Medicine at
Mount Sinai in NY, USA, and colleagues.16 The authors conclude by
pointing out that the field of cardiac transplantation continues to
evolve, including more complex recipients and donors, yet advances
in medical and surgical management have so far outstripped the challenges with sustained improved survival. Focused detailed statistical
analysis of outcomes such as this Stanford report is needed to monitor when and if these challenges outbalance the risks.
Recent clinical trials indicate that SGLT2 inhibitors improve cardiovascular outcomes in HF patients, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. In a Translational Research article entitled 'Effects
of canagliflozin on human myocardial redox signalling: clinical implications', Hidekazu Kondo from the University of Oxford
in the UK, and colleagues explored the direct effects of canagliflozin,
an SGLT2 inhibitor with mild SGLT1 inhibitory effects, on myocardial
redox signalling in humans.17 Study 1 included 364 patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Right atrial appendage biopsies were harvested
to quantify superoxide sources and the expression of inflammation,
fibrosis, and myocardial stretch genes. In Study 2, atrial tissue from 51
patients was used ex vivo to study the direct effects of canagliflozin on
NADPH oxidase activity and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) uncoupling.
Differentiated H9C2 and primary human cardiomyocytes (hCMs)
were used to further characterize the underlying mechanisms (Study
3). SGLT1 was abundantly expressed in human atrial tissue and
hCMs, in contrast to SGLT2. Myocardial SGLT1 expression was positively associated with superoxide production and profibrotic, proinflammatory, and wall stretch gene expression. Canagliflozin reduced
NADPH oxidase activity via AMP kinase (AMPK)/Rac1 signalling and
improved NOS coupling via increased tetrahydrobiopterin bioavailability ex vivo and in vitro. These were attenuated by knocking down
SGLT1 in hCMs. Canagliflozin had striking ex vivo transcriptomic
effects on myocardial redox signalling, suppressing apoptotic and inflammatory pathways in hCM.
The authors conclude that these findings reveal a novel mechanism
contributing to the beneficial cardiac effects of canagliflozin. The
