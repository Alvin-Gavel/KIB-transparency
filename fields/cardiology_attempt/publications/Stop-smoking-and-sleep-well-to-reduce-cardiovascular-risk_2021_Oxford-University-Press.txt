This Focus Issue on epidemiology and prevention contains the ESC
Fast Track manuscript 'Efficacy of a digital therapeutics system
in the management of essential hypertension: the HERBDH1 pivotal trial' by Kazuomi Kario from the Jichi Medical
University School of Medicine in Japan, and colleagues.1 We are witnessing an exponential interest in digital health.2,3 Digital therapeutics
refers to an emerging branch of medicine, which utilizes technologybased software algorithms or applications to facilitate disease management. Although there are a plethora of apps claiming to help manage hypertension, few have been developed in collaboration with
healthcare professionals or device companies, and none has undergone rigorous scientific assessment of clinical efficacy in patients with
hypertension. Furthermore, the data that are available are not consistent with respect to the effects of digital therapeutics on blood
pressure (BP) levels. Based on promising findings from a small pilot
trial, the HERB Digital Hypertension 1 (HERB-DH1) pivotal trial, the
authors investigated the efficacy of digital therapeutics in patients
with hypertension not receiving antihypertensive medication. This
prospective, open-label, randomized controlled study was performed at 12 sites in Japan. Patients with hypertension [office systolic
BP (SBP) 140-<180 mmHg and 24 h SBP >_130 mmHg] were randomly assigned 1:1 to the digital therapeutics group (HERB system th
standard lifestyle modification) or control group (standard lifestyle
modification alone). The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean
change in 24 h ambulatory SBP from baseline to 12 weeks; key secondary efficacy endpoints were mean changes in office and home BP
from baseline to 12 weeks. Between December 2019 and June 2020,
a total of 390 patients were randomly assigned to the digital therapeutics group (n = 199) or control (n = 191) group. Between-group
differences in 24 h ambulatory, home, and office SBPs at 12 weeks
were -2.4, -4.3, and -3.6 mmHg, respectively, and all significant. No
major programme-related safety events occurred up to 24 weeks.

The authors conclude that the HERB-DH1 pivotal study shows
the superiority of digital therapeutics compared with standard lifestyle modification alone to reduce 24 h ambulatory, home, and office
BP in the absence of antihypertensive medications. The article is
accompanied by an Editorial by Luis Ruilope from the Hospital 12
de Octubre in Madrid, Spain, and colleagues.4 The authors note that
more effort is needed to efficiently implement healthy lifestyle
changes for the prevention and management of arterial hypertension.
Initiatives such as digital therapeutics might pave the way for a new
era in which the technology of the new millennium can be used-
paradoxically-to help us return to a more 'traditional' (non-westernized) way of living.
Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have revolutionized the treatment of non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF).5-7 Persistence with
DOACs has become a concern in NVAF patients, but whether this
affects prognosis is rarely studied. In a clinical research article entitled
'Predictors, time course, and outcomes of persistence patterns in oral anticoagulation for non-valvular atrial fibrillation: a Dutch Nationwide Cohort Study', Myrthe Toorop from
the Leiden University Medical Center in the Netherlands, and colleagues investigated the persistence with oral anticoagulants (OACs)
and its association with prognosis among a nationwide cohort of
NVAF patients.5 DOAC-naive NVAF patients who started to use
DOACs for ischaemic stroke prevention between 2013 and 2018
were included using Dutch national statistics. Persistence with OACs
was determined based on the presence of a 100 day gap between the
last prescription and the end of study period. The cumulative incidence of persistence with OACs was 88, 83, 78, and 72% at 1, 2, 3,
and 4 years after receiving DOACs, respectively. Baseline characteristics associated with better persistence with OACs included female
sex, age range 65-74 years, permanent AF, previous exposure to
vitamin K antagonists, stroke history (including transient ischaemic attack), and a CHA2DS2-VASc score >_2. Non-persistence with OACs
was associated with a significantly increased risk of the composite
outcome of ischaemic stroke and ischaemic stroke-related death

[adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.79] and ischaemic stroke [aHR 1.58,
95% confidence interval (CI) 1.29-1.93] compared with being persistent with OACs (Figure 1).
The authors conclude that at least a quarter of NVAF patients are
non-persistent with OACs within 4 years, which is associated with
poor efficacy of ischaemic stroke prevention. The identified baseline
characteristics may help to identify patients at risk of nonpersistence. The article is accompanied by an Editorial by Peter
Vibe Rasmussen from the Herlev-Gentofte University Hospital in
Denmark and Elaine Hylek from Boston University in the USA.8 The
authors highlight that while it is unclear what specific initiatives and
interventions could be beneficial in improving treatment persistence,
it is obvious that the current rates of persistence with treatment are
suboptimal, as stressed by the study by Toorop et al. Successful treatment of AF requires not only scrutiny of risk factors and identification
of patients requiring stroke prophylaxis, but also subsequent recognition of patients at risk of being non-persistent with a potentially lifesaving treatment. It is concerning that an inappropriately low persistence with treatment is still an obstacle in the quest to gain full benefit
of prophylactic treatment with OACs in AF. Interventional studies
aiming at improving treatment persistence should be a distinct priority in future AF research.
Smoking is an established potent risk factor.9,10 However, it is still
uncertain whether smoking reduction rather than cessation is sufficient to reduce cardiovascular risk. In a clinical research article entitled 'Smoking cessation, but not reduction, reduces
cardiovascular disease incidence' Su-Min Jeong from the
Samsung Medical Center in the Republic of Korea, and colleagues

assessed the association of smoking cessation and reduction with risk
of cardiovascular disease (CVD).11 A total of 900 000 current
smokers aged >_40 years who had undergone two consecutive national health examinations (in 2009 and 2011) were included.
Participants were classified as quitters (20.6%), reducers I (>_50% reduction, 7.3%), reducers II (20-50% reduction, 11.6%), sustainers
(45.7%), and increasers (>_20% increase, 14.5%). During 5 575 556
person-years of follow-up, 17 748 stroke and 11 271 myocardial infarction (MI) events were identified. Quitters had significantly
decreased risk of stroke (aHR 0.77) and MI (aHR 0.74) compared
with sustainers after adjustment for demographic factors, comorbidities, and smoking status. The risk of stroke and MI incidence in reducers I and reducers II was not significantly different from the risk in
sustainers.
The authors conclude that smoking cessation, but not reduction,
was associated with reduced CVD risk. Their study emphasizes the
importance of sustained quitting in terms of CVD risk reduction.
The manuscript is accompanied by an Editorial by Charlotte
Andersson and Amalie Lykkemark Moller from the Boston
University School of Medicine in Boston, MA, USA.12 The authors
conclude that the low prevalence of women (5%) must be acknowledged as a limitation of the present study. Although this is likely to
reflect the epidemiology of smoking in East Asia, under-reporting of
smoking in women may be a concern. In addition, non-cigarette tobacco products have become very common in some populations. In
South East Asia, smokeless tobacco has been reported to be one of
the most common types of tobacco among the youth, and e-cigarettes have also gained a lot of popularity among the youth

were obtained from the Health and Retirement Study in the USA
for a population-representative sample of 12 761 middle-aged and
older adults who were free from HF at baseline in 2002.
Respondents were followed for 16 years for incident HF. We
employed marginal structural discrete-time survival analyses to adjust for potential time-varying biological, psycho-cognitive, and behavioural factors and to account for bias due to differential loss to
follow-up. At baseline, 38% of the respondents reported experiencing at least one insomnia symptom. During the 16-year follow-up,
1730 respondents developed incident HF. Respondents experiencing one (HR = 1.22), two (HR = 1.45), three (HR = 1.66), or four
(HR = 1.80) insomnia symptoms had a significantly higher hazard of
incident HF than asymptomatic respondents as well as respondents
that had trouble initiating sleep (HR = 1.17), maintaining sleep (HR
= 1.14), early-morning awakening (HR = 1.20), or non-restorative
sleep (HR = 1.25).
The authors conclude that insomnia symptoms, both cumulatively
and individually, are associated with incident HF. Public health awareness and screening for insomnia symptoms in at-risk populations
should be encouraged to reduce HF incidence. The contribution is
accompanied by an Editorial by Mathieu Berger from the Lausanne
University Hospital (CHUV) and University of Lausanne in
Switzerland, and colleagues.19 The authors conclude that overall, the
study of Mahmood et al. provides robust evidence that insomnia
complaints are not minor symptoms in a middle- to older-age population but may also have severe long-term cardiovascular consequences. Insomnia symptoms are easily recognizable and modifiable, but
many individuals with insomnia remain untreated despite the effectiveness of available treatment options. Although the ability of insomnia treatments to prevent HF remains unproven, they advise general
practitioners and cardiologists to consider sleep complaints when
conducting clinical cardiovascular risk assessment. Where significant
issues are identified, patients should be referred to sleep specialists
for investigation of the sleep complaints, to rule out another sleep
disorder and, if necessary, manage insomnia disorder with appropriate treatments such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT-I). At the
very least, this should improve health-related quality of life. Sleep is
essential to health. It is time to put sleep back at the heart of our
concerns.
With the intensification of social production pressure and the refinement of the division of labour, shift work is gradually becoming
common among employees in modern society. According to the 6th
European Working Conditions Survey, nearly 21% of the working
population engaged in shift work, which is identified as an irregular
working schedule outside the conventional daytime. Growing evidence indicates that shift work, particularly night shift work, has an
adverse impact on individual health and organ function. In a Clinical
Research article entitled 'Long-term night shift work is associated with the risk of atrial fibrillation and coronary heart
disease', Ningjian Wang from the Shanghai JiaoTong University
School of Medicine in China, and colleagues sought to test whether
current and past night shift work was associated with incident AF and
whether this association was modified by genetic vulnerability.20 Its
associations with coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and HF
were measured as a secondary aim. This cohort study included >283
000 participants in paid employment or self-employed without AF
and >276 000 participants free of CHD, stroke, and HF at baseline in

especially in high-income countries. Whether switching to such
products alters CVD risks is not well understood yet and remains
another research priority.
Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) refers to a spectrum of entities,
which are related to both structural and functional pathologies of the
venous system. The pathophysiology of CVI displays a complex interplay of venous valve dysfunction and venous hypertension, with subsequent macro- and microcirculatory haemodynamic and vascular
alterations. Telangiectasia, reticular venectasia, varicose veins, and
CVI ranging from oedema to active skin ulcers represent the most
common clinically visible manifestations of chronic venous disease.
Evidence regarding the health burden of CVI, its clinical determinants,
and impact on outcome is scarce. In a Clinical Research article entitled 'Chronic venous insufficiency, cardiovascular disease,
and mortality: a population study' Jurgen H. Prochaska from the
University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg University
Mainz in Germany, and colleagues looked into this issue further.13
Systematic phenotyping of CVI according to the established CEAP
(Clinical-Etiologic-Anatomic-Pathophysiologic) classification was
performed in >12 000 participants (age range: 40-80 years) of the
Gutenberg Health Study from April 2012 to April 2017. Replication
of findings was done in an independent cohort study (MyoVasc,
NCT04064450). The prevalence of telangiectasia/reticular veins, varicose veins, and CVI was 36, 13, and 41%, respectively. Age, female
sex, arterial hypertension, obesity, smoking, and clinically overt CVD
were identified as clinical determinants of CVI. During a mean followup of 6.4 years, CVI was a strong predictor of all-cause death independent of the concomitant clinical profile and medication (HR 1.46,
P = 0. 0003). The association of CVI with an increased risk of all-cause
death was externally validated in the MyoVasc cohort (HR 1.51,
P = 0.009).
The authors conclude that CVI is highly prevalent in the population and is associated with the presence of cardiovascular risk factors and disease. Individuals with CVI experience an elevated risk of
death, which is independent of age and sex, and present cardiovascular risk factors and comorbidities. This manuscript is accompanied
by an Editorial by Naomi Hamburg from the Boston University
School of Medicine in the USA.14 Hamburg concludes that the study
by Prochaska et al. provides another reason to examine our
patients' legs for signs of chronic venous disease as a window to the
heart. Hamburg points out that she will still explain to patients with
chronic venous disease that varicose veins are not the same as
blocked arteries. But, she will also be sure to comprehensively
evaluate for the presence of cardiovascular risk factors, encourage
exercise and risk factor modification, and await future research to
identify the impact of venous targeted therapies on cardiovascular
disease.
Heart failure (HF) is an ongoing epidemic and a serious clinical
and public health issue.15-17 Currently, little is known about prospective associations between insomnia symptoms and HF incidence. In a clinical research article entitled 'Insomnia symptoms
and incident heart failure: a population-based cohort
study', Asos Mahmood from the The University of Memphis School
of Public Health in Memphis, TN, USA, and colleagues investigated
the longitudinal associations between time-varying insomnia symptoms (difficulty initiating sleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, earlymorning awakening, non-restorative sleep) and incident HF.18 Data

the UK Biobank. The weighted genetic risk score for AF was calculated. During a median follow-up of 10.4 years, 5777 incident AF
cases were documented. From 'day workers', 'shift but never/rarely
night shifts', and 'some night shifts' to 'usual/permanent night shifts',
there was a significant increasing trend in the risk of incident AF (P for
trend 0.013). Usual or permanent night shifts were associated with
the highest risk (HR 1.16). These associations were not modified by
genetic predisposition to AF. Usual/permanent current night shifts,
>_10 years and 3-8 nights/month of lifetime night shifts were significantly associated with a higher risk of incident CHD (HR 1.22, HR
1.37, and HR 1.35, respectively).
The authors conclude that night shift exposures are associated
with increased AF risk, regardless of genetic AF risk. Night shift exposure also increases the risk of CHD but not of stroke or HF.
Whether decreasing night shift work frequency and duration might
represent another avenue to improve heart health during working
life and beyond warrants further study. The manuscript is accompanied by an Editorial by Dominik Linz from the Maastricht University
Medical Centre and Cardiovascular Research Institute Maastricht in
the Netherlands, and colleagues.21 The authors conclude that lifestyle
and behavioural interventions have become increasingly recognized
as important tools for risk factor modification for primary and secondary CVD prevention. Whether environmental and lifestyle modifications of circadian rhythm and clock-based therapeutic strategies,
including chronotherapy, and pharmacological agents that target core
clock components and proximal regulators, are likely to alter CVD
outcomes remains unclear. It appears that limiting night shifts to a
minimum and allowing recreational recovery periods after each night
shift block, and coordinating the work schedule with family or social
time is the best advice a clinician can provide in this regard. To implement this strategy, discussions with all stakeholders are needed, and
governmental countermeasures need to be implemented.
The issue is also complemented by two Discussion Forum contributions. In a commentary entitled 'Air pollution and cardiovascular diseases in young adults', Yanguo Xin from the Beijing
Friendship Hospital and Junli Li from Sichuan University in China
comment on the recent publication 'Association of the combined effects of air pollution and changes in physical activity
with cardiovascular disease in young adults' by Seong Rae Kim
from the Seoul National University College of Medicine in South
Korea.22,23 Kim et al. respond in a separate comment.24
The editors hope that readers of this issue of the European Heart
Journal will find it of interest.
