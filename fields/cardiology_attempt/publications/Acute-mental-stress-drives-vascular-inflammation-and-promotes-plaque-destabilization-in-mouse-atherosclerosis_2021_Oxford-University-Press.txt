atherosclerotic plaques by modulating endothelial cells. Specifically, acute stress increases adhesion molecule expression and chemokine release through locally derived norepinephrine. Either chemical or surgical disruption of norepinephrine signalling diminished stress-induced leucocyte migration into mouse atherosclerotic plaques.

Introduction
Mental or psychological stress is a well-established contributor to
human morbidity and mortality.1 The term stress describes the body's
response to environmental challenges that exceed an individual's ability
to cope.1 Stress is comprised of a stimulus (stressor) that precipitates
a reaction in the brain (stress perception). This, in turn, activates
physiologic 'fight-or-flight' systems in the body (stress response).2
Experiencing a stressful situation, as perceived by the cerebral cortex,
stimulates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.1 The pituitary gland
liberates adrenocorticotropic hormone, triggering the systemic release
of glucocorticoid hormones from the adrenal cortex.1,3 Additionally,
the sympathetic-adrenal-medullary axis activates when the adrenal medulla releases catecholamines systemically (predominantly epinephrine).1 Stress can also activate local sympathetic neurons in end organs,
leading to the local release of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine.3
Clinical and experimental studies have associated mental stressors
with the development of diseases and infections.1,4 Specifically, social
stressors increase the incidence of cardiovascular diseases, including
atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke.5-10 Stress at
work and in private life associates with a 40-50% increase in coronary
artery disease, as observed in prospective studies.3 Mental stressors
can be chronic or acute, depending on the length and severity of the exposure. Chronic mental stress (such as job stress, marital unhappiness,
burden of caregiving, or perceptions of being treated unfairly) refers to
long-term, repetitive stress exposure.11 We showed that chronic variable stressors promote leucocyte production through increased haematopoietic stem cell proliferation.12,13 In contrast, acute mental stress is

acute mental stress. A previous study showed that watching exciting
soccer matches raises cardiovascular events acutely and transiently.17
Hence, we performed an experiment in which 35 soccer fans
watched a thrilling key soccer match. Study participants were emotionally involved because their national team played. Accordingly,
when we assessed stress levels 24 h before and immediately after the
game ended, we found that watching the match augmented stress
perception, as measured by the visual analogue scale (Figure 1A, experimental design is outlined in Supplementary material online, Figure
S1A). Further, we obtained two blood samples to analyse the numbers of blood leucocytes, the effector cells of the immune system. A
first sample was collected 24 h before the game ended and a second
sample immediately after the game, so that the samples were taken at
the same time of day. Using flow cytometry, we found that total leucocyte-and specifically inflammatory monocyte-numbers decreased
rapidly after stress (Figure 1B and C). Further, lymphocyte numbers
also declined upon stress, while neutrophil numbers remained unchanged (Supplementary material online, Figure S1B and C). Of note,
systolic and diastolic blood pressure did not change and only a slight
increase in heart rate followed acute mental stress exposure
(Supplementary material online, Figure S1D).
To follow-up on the observed drop in leucocyte numbers, we subjected mice to acute mental stress by restraint/immobilization, the
most widely used procedure in rodents to evoke acute mental
stress.20 Flow cytometry showed lower blood leucocyte levels, specifically for inflammatory monocytes, immediately after a single 3 h episode of mental stress, a result that agrees with our human data
(Figure 1D and E). Similarly, lymphocyte numbers dropped after stress,
while neutrophil numbers were not altered at this distinct time point
(Figure 1E and Supplementary material online, Figure S1E and F). Kinetic
experiments revealed that blood leucocyte levels started to drop just
15 min after stress initiation and rebounded rapidly once stress ended
(Supplementary material online, Figure S1G-I). Cell-tracking experiments using adoptive transfer explored the fate of these vanishing leucocytes. We retrieved GFPhigh myeloid cells (monocytes admixed with
neutrophils) from naive transgenic Ubc-GFP mice (all leucocytes express green fluorescent protein, GFP), injected the cells intravenously
into wild-type mice (all cells are GFPnegative), and began stressing them
for 3 h immediately thereafter. A control cohort also underwent adoptive cell transfer but was not exposed to stress. We harvested several
tissues and tracked the GFPhigh myeloid cells in tissues using flow
cytometry 21 h after we stopped stressing the mice (Supplementary
material online, Figure S2A). While GFPhigh myeloid cell numbers
decreased in the blood, we found more numerous GFPhigh myeloid
cells in the skin, heart, and lung of stressed mice than in those of unstressed controls, indicating that acute mental stress promotes leucocyte migration to these tissues (Figure 1F and G and Supplementary
material online, Figure S2B-D). To exclude the possibility that stress
simply enhances leucocyte adhesion to endothelial cells without subsequent transmigration into tissues (i.e. marginalization), we labelled the
blood pool using an intravenously injected, fluorescently tagged antiCD45 (pan-leucocyte marker) antibody 5 min before we harvested tissues, as described previously.21 Blood pool labelling was highly efficient
(Supplementary material online, Figure S2E) and we used this technique
in every flow cytometry experiment to exclude blood cell contamination. Taken together, our data indicate that mental stress exposure

Stress-induced modulation of endothelial
cells depends on norepinephrine
Leucocyte recruitment is a process in which circulating blood leucocytes and endothelial cells act jointly to mediate rolling, adhesion, and
transmigration.25,26 Thus, we next explored mechanistically how
stress promotes leucocyte recruitment into tissues. We first tested
whether stress activates endothelial cells and consequently promotes
leucocyte influx. We applied acute mental stress to wild-type mice
for 30 min, excised aortas to identify aortic endothelial cells using
flow cytometry, and assessed classical cell adhesion molecule levels
on the endothelial cell surfaces (Supplementary material online,

acute mental stress (Figure 3A). To better understand the changes
endothelial cells undergo in response to acute stress, we isolated by
FACS (fluorescence-activated cell sorting) aortic endothelial cells
from stressed vs. non-stressed mice for RNA sequencing. Out of
15 054 detectable transcripts, 533 genes were expressed differentially, of which 335 (63%) rose and 198 (37%) fell (log2 fold change >_
+/-0.58, adj. P < 0.05, Supplementary material online, Figure S4B). A
gene set enrichment analysis found that up-regulated genes were
preferentially enriched in pathways related to cell 'movement', 'locomotion', 'adhesion', 'localization', 'motility', and 'migration' (Figure 3B
and Supplementary material online, Figure S4C and Tables S1 and S2),
all critical to leucocyte recruitment. Apart from expressing cell adhesion molecules, endothelial cells-among other cells that reside inside plaques-can also release cytokines/chemokines that function as

.. endothelial cells were primed with norepinephrine (Supplementary
..

..
.. neutrophils/monocytes are primed with norepinephrine. To address
.. this, we repeated the experiments described above and added neu..
.. trophils/monocytes while norepinephrine was still present in the cul.. ture medium (Supplementary material online, Figure S5G). Exposing
..
.. neutrophils/monocytes to norepinephrine did not further boost ad.. herence (Supplementary material online, Figure S5H). Next, we
..
.. probed via which adrenoreceptor norepinephrine exerts its actions

.. leucocyte adherence to a norepinephrine-stimulated endothelial cell
..
.. layer (Supplementary material online, Figure S5I and J). Taken to..
.. gether, these results indicate that norepinephrine, but not epineph.. rine or corticosterone, increases adhesion molecule levels on
..
.. endothelial cells and thereby promotes neutrophil and monocyte ad.. herence. Unlike epinephrine and corticosterone, norepinephrine led
..
.. to a similar endothelial cell activation pattern under both low and
.. high shear stress conditions, suggesting this effect occurs independ..
.. ently of altered haemodynamic/shear forces (Figure 3E-M and
.. Supplementary material online, Figure S5K-P). Next, we explored
..
.. whether norepinephrine also elevates the release of CXCL1 and

..
.. In line, neutralizing endothelial cell secreted CCL7 dampened leuco.. cyte adhesion after norepinephrine stimulation in cell culture experi..
.. ments (Supplementary material online, Figure S5Q and R).
..
Although our experiments suggest a direct effect of norepineph..
.. rine on endothelial cells in terms of adhesion molecule levels and
..
.. chemokine release (Figure 3E, H, and I and Supplementary material
.. online, Figures S4I and S5R), indirect effects may also occur. Other

.. interleukin-6 (IL-6). These cytokines may then signal to endothelial

..
.. a rise in IL-1b and IL-6 levels in the supernatant of norepinephrine.. stimulated macrophages and vascular smooth muscle cells
..
.. (Supplementary material online, Figure S5S-U).

Taken together, our findings demonstrate that norepinephrine

S4D). We confirmed these results using ELISA and further found that
CXCL1 levels expanded as early as 30 min after stress, while CCL7
levels increased after 90 min of stress (Figure 3C). Other classical chemokines such as CCL2 were not affected (Supplementary material
online, Figure S4E). To determine the cellular source of CXCL1 and
CCL7, we first FACS-isolated endothelial cells, monocytes/macrophages, neutrophils, and fibroblasts from atherosclerotic aortas
(Supplementary material online, Figure S4F). Using qPCR, we found
that all cell fractions express CXCL1 and CCL7 in reasonable
amounts (Supplementary material online, Figure S4G and H). In line,
cultured endothelial cells, macrophages, vascular smooth muscle
cells, and fibroblasts release substantial amounts of CXCL1 and
CCL7 (Supplementary material online, Figure S4I).
Next, we investigated how acute stress activates endothelial cells.
It is known that stress exposure leads to release of stress hormones
(norepinephrine, epinephrine, and corticosterone), followed by elevated blood pressure and heart rate.2 Norepinephrine levels rose locally inside vessel walls, where it is released from sympathetic fibres
and acts as their neurotransmitter, but not systemically (i.e. in
plasma). Moreover, when we assessed the tunica intima separately,
we detected a substantial amount of norepinephrine in human intima
samples obtained surgically during coronary (2.32 +/- 0.4 pg/mg tissue,
n = 3, all male, age 69 +/- 14.2, mean +/- SD) and carotid endarterectomy (0.78 +/- 0.9 pg/mg tissue, n = 12, 75% male, age 72 +/- 8.4, mean +/-
SD). In contrast, levels of corticosterone (the murine analogue of
human cortisol) and epinephrine rose systemically, as they are mainly
released into the circulation from the adrenal gland (Figure 3D). We
also found that acute stress leads to aortic tyrosine hydroxylase
phosphorylation that activates this rate-limiting enzyme in norepinephrine synthesis (Supplementary material online, Figure S4J). In line
with this stress-induced hormone release, we found that blood pressure and heart rate surged transiently during stress, as assessed by
continuous invasive measurements (Supplementary material online,
Figure S4K). In conclusion, our findings indicate that acute stress promotes leucocyte recruitment to tissues through the modulation of
endothelial cells.
Next, we explored whether norepinephrine, epinephrine, or corticosterone directly activate endothelial cells, independently of secondary haemodynamic changes. We cultured primary murine aortic
endothelial cells under elevated flow conditions (30 dyn/cm2, mimicking increased blood pressure) and incubated them with either norepinephrine, epinephrine, or corticosterone (Supplementary
material online, Figure S5A and B). In contrast to epinephrine and corticosterone, norepinephrine increased protein levels of ICAM1,
VCAM1, E-, and P-Selectin, indicating that norepinephrine directly
stimulates endothelial cells (Figure 3E-G). We also tested the functional correlates of the altered adhesion molecules by monitoring
leucocyte adherence to either norepinephrine-, epinephrine-, or
corticosterone-exposed endothelial cells. For this purpose, we
repeated the experiment described above and added naive neutrophils/monocytes retrieved from wild-type mice and fluorescently
labelled ex vivo (Supplementary material online, Figure S5C). We
detected more neutrophil/monocyte adherence to the
norepinephrine-primed endothelial cell layer, but not in epinephrineor corticosterone-primed endothelial cells (Figure 3H-M). Further
experiments revealed that this norepinephrine effect is dose-dependent (Supplementary material online, Figure S5D). Similar to our

Acute mental stress drives vascular inflammation and promotes plaque destabilization in mouse atherosclerosis

Discussion
Observational studies identified mental stress as a risk and prognostic
factor for several diseases. Specifically, mental stress associates with
cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and mental health disorders.2 In the INTERHEART study, the authors report that mental
stress is as strongly associated with the occurrence of MI (odds ratio
2.67) than other classical risk factors, such as diabetes (odds ratio
2.37) or hypertension (odds ratio 1.91).32 However, this association
may specifically affect stress-susceptible individuals.19 Taken together,
these studies indicate that mental stress is a potentially modifiable
risk factor that substantially contributes to cardiovascular mortality
and morbidity. However, we do not fully understand the mechanisms
by which stress exacerbates cardiovascular disease, and current
state-of-the-art treatment does not address this risk. Our study provides evidence that acute stress exposure promotes the rapid expansion of inflammatory leucocytes in hearts, lungs, skin, and, if present,
atherosclerotic plaques. Expansion occurs through a stress-induced
increase in blood leucocyte recruitment. Mechanistically, stress promotes leucocyte recruitment through norepinephrine-mediated
modulation of endothelial cells. Our observations propose a possible
mechanism through which people with acute stress exposure (for instance soccer spectators) experience cardiovascular events such as
acute coronary syndrome, including MI. Further, we provide evidence

either surgical superior cervical ganglion removal or sham surgery, we adoptively transferred GFPhigh neutrophils and monocytes retrieved from naive Ubc-GFP mice and stressed the
recipients immediately after the transfer (Supplementary material
online, Figure S6C). In accordance with the data produced by
chemical norepinephrine depletion, surgical norepinephrine depletion lowered uptake and expansion of myeloid cells in atherosclerotic aortas (Figure 4B-D). Next, we lowered the systemic
supply of stress hormones using bilateral adrenalectomy and
found that endothelial leucocyte adhesion molecules and blood
leucocyte levels were unchanged in stressed adrenalectomized
mice in comparison to stressed sham-operated mice
(Supplementary material online, Figure S6E and F). These experiments indicate that locally rather than systemically sourced norepinephrine promotes stress-induced plaque leucocyte
recruitment. Since acute stress leads to a surplus release of
CXCL1 and CCL7, we conducted an intervention experiment in
which we neutralized these chemokines using anti-CXCL1 and CCL7 antibodies (Figure 4E). Anti-CXCL1 and -CCL7 treatment
curtailed plaque GFPhigh cell recruitment compared with controls
(Figure 4F and G) and hence lowered aortic myeloid cell numbers
(Figure 4H). In summary, after exposure to acute mental stress,
norepinephrine acts on endothelial cells and macrophages, leading to increased expression of endothelial adhesion molecules
and augmented release of the chemokines CXCL1 and CCL7. As
a consequence, monocyte and neutrophil recruitment occurs in
susceptible tissues, particularly atherosclerotic aortas. These
data provide new insights into how acute mental stress elevates
vascular inflammation and promotes plaque rupture (Graphical
abstract).

Stress-induced destabilization of atherosclerotic plaques
Vulnerable, rupture-prone plaques typically show a high content of
inflammatory leucocytes, large necrotic cores, and thin fibrous
caps.23 Our data reveal that acute stress rapidly rendered plaques
more vulnerable as documented by an expansion of plaque inflammatory leucocytes, a decrease in intimal smooth muscle cell numbers,
and a shift towards increased extracellular matrix breakdown.
Consequently, plaque rupture occurred more often than in nonstressed counterparts. This finding aligns with a study where exposure to mental stress also led to acute myocardial ischaemia in atherosclerotic mice.41
Our experiments show an association of acute stress with a higher
incidence of plaque rupture, but whether plaque rupture is caused by
the involvement of local stress-induced norepinephrine signalling
remains to be clarified. Future experiments are needed to fully determine the link of norepinephrine/endothelial cell interactions and
plaque rupture. Among soccer spectators, the incidence of STelevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) rose transiently during
key games.17 STEMI is typically caused by obstructive coronary artery disease with plaque rupture/erosion. These observations
align with our findings that stress triggers plaque rupture and may

hence lead to coronary obstruction resulting in MI. However,
stress may trigger myocardial ischaemia also in the absence of plaque rupture and obstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA, myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries). Stress
leads to a transient catecholamine excess which may, for instance,
cause coronary artery spasm, microvascular dysfunction,
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, and a supply/demand mismatch (elevated blood pressure and heart rate).

Biological basis of stress-induced
leucocyte recruitment
One may speculate about the purpose of enhanced leucocyte recruitment in a 'fight-or-flight' situation. In general, this 'fight-or-flight'
stress response likely evolved to bolster survival.42 In huntergatherers thousands of years ago, stress-induced leucocyte recruitment to lungs, heart, and skin may have rapidly and beneficially supported the cardio-pulmonary system, since enhanced physical activity
demands increased oxygen supply from the lungs and higher cardiac
output from the heart, while the skin is likely the first organ that could
be injured in a 'fight-or-flight' situation. Maybe the body prepares distinct tissues to face challenges even before a wound or infection
occurs to enhance function or regeneration after injury. In modern
times, we more often acquire diseases that were not relevant for our
ancestors. One example is atherosclerosis, which is now the leading
cause of death worldwide. When concomitant atherosclerosis exists,
stress-induced leucocyte recruitment also occurs in atherosclerotic
plaques, where these inflammatory cells drive disease progression
resulting in plaque destabilization with subsequent erosion/rupture,
as documented here and described in humans.17 Thus, mental stress
seems to be acutely harmful if atherosclerotic plaques are present.
Further, contemporary humans do not exercise after stress exposure
like our hunter-gatherer ancestors did and hence we do not counterbalance the stress reaction via physical activity. In addition to being
beneficial in cardiovascular disease,43 physical activity may be a valuable outlet for stress.

Acute mental stress vs. other nonclassical risk factors
Our study reveals that mental stressor type (intense vs. mild) and
exposure time (acute vs. chronic exposure) contribute differentially to disease progression. Chronic mild stress (6 weeks of repetitive exposure to mild stressors) activates haematopoietic
stem cells in the bone marrow, leading to increased leucocyte
production, and consequently resulting in blood leukocytosis.12
Since leucocyte supply was higher, increased leucocyte numbers
accumulated inside plaques. In contrast, acute stress (short-term
exposure to an intense stressor) decreases blood leucocyte levels, promotes leucocyte recruitment, and thus results in inflammatory cell accumulation inside tissues.
Moreover, our study has to be interpreted in the context of other
studies, which mechanistically link non-classical risk factors, such as
sleep deprivation, sedentary lifestyle, air pollution, and environmental
noise to cardiovascular disease.43-46

leucocytes37 and resident endothelial cells and macrophages at the
same time. Our blood leucocyte subset kinetics reveal that stressinduced leucocyte recruitment may involve neutrophils and monocytes serially and not in parallel. Blood neutrophil numbers seem to
decrease earlier in the blood and may hence be earlier recruited to
plaques than blood Ly6Chigh monocytes. This is in line with our finding that CXCL1-a strong chemoattractant for neutrophils-rises
early in response to stress.
Moreover, our adoptive transfer experiments suggest that blood
Ly6Chigh monocyte (the murine equivalent to human inflammatory
monocytes) numbers decline because they are taken up by susceptible tissues. Since classical monocytes also decreased in humans after
stress exposure, we believe that a similar mechanism (recruitment to
susceptible tissues) also occurs in humans, but cannot exclude other
potential causes for the observed decline, like altered conversion
from classical to intermediate or non-classical monocyte subsets.38,39
Further studies are needed to fully explore the fate of the nonclassical monocyte subset in mice and humans upon stress.
Further, our findings indicate that uptake of neutrophils and monocytes does not occur equally among several tissues but rather seems
to be restricted to lungs, heart, skin, and, if present, atherosclerotic
plaques. Our results in the skin agree with a previous study in which
researchers stressed mice once for 2.5 h (restraint stress) immediately before subcutaneously implanting a saline-treated gelatine
sponge.40 They explanted the sponge 6, 24, 48, or 72 h later and
assessed the leucocyte content. The authors found that leucocyte
numbers in the sponge peaked 24 h after stress, indicating that acute
stress exposure promoted influx into this subcutaneously implanted
foreign body.
Furthermore, we provide evidence that stress-induced leucocyte
recruitment can be pharmacologically modulated. Data from our
intervention experiments suggest that targeting the stress-induced
release of CXCL1 and CCL7 may represent a novel therapeutic
strategy to reduce cardiovascular complications of stress.

Limitations

Summary and clinical perspective
In summary, stress is a crucial risk factor for atherosclerosis and substantially contributes to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.
Here, we show that acute stress enhances leucocyte recruitment to
tissues, including atherosclerotic plaques, through norepinephrinedependent modulation of endothelial cells and macrophages. As a
consequence, stress promotes the accumulation of inflammatory plaque leucocytes, known drivers of vascular inflammation and plaque
progression. From a clinical perspective, our findings indicate that (i)
acute mental stress exposure may trigger plaque rupture/erosion by
promoting vascular inflammation, (ii) particularly stress-susceptible
patients with pre-existing atherosclerosis are at risk and should be
identified early, and (iii) targeting stress-induced uptake of inflammatory cells may present a novel therapeutic avenue to prevent stressrelated cardiovascular complications.

Because our human study is associative by nature, interpretation of
our findings merits consideration of confounding factors that may
have influenced the results. Further, an additional control group is
lacking. This could have been, for instance (i) the same study group
watching a soccer game in which they are not emotionally involved
or (ii) a group of matched individuals with no interest in soccer
watching the match side by side with the soccer fans. Moreover, unlike the mice we used (pre-existing atherosclerotic plaques), our
study population was healthy and did not show any comorbidities.
Consequently, it was not possible to address recruitment to human
plaques. In addition, we did not account for instrumental variability
and cannot exclude an effect of chance due to a small sample size.
Also, since blood pressure and heart rate were measured twice and
not continuously, we may have missed a transient elevation during
the game. Nevertheless, we chose to perform this experiment because observational studies strongly linked watching exciting soccer
games to cardiovascular event occurence.17 In our pre-clinical experiments, restraint stress may represent a rather severe form of stress
and may therefore generate a strong stress response. Thus, our findings may indicate one extreme form of stress-induced responses.
Yet, the finding that blood leucocyte levels also decreased after stress
exposure in humans possibly suggests the operation of similar mechanisms, even if the humans have less pronounced differences.

Translational perspective

Mental stress is comparably associated with the occurrence of myocardial infarction, a major contributor to worldwide mortality, as
other classical risk factors, such as diabetes or hypertension. Despite this huge impact on public health, we do not yet fully understand
the mechanisms nor does state-of-the-art treatment reduce stress-related risk.
Our study addresses this gap in mechanistic knowledge and reveals that after exposure to acute mental stress, norepinephrine acts
on endothelial cells and macrophages, leading to increased expression of adhesion molecules and augmented release of the chemokines
CXCL1 and CCL7. As a consequence, monocyte and neutrophil recruitment occurs in susceptible tissues, particularly atherosclerotic
plaques. We further provide evidence that these pre-clinical findings may be translated to humans with stress exposure and that specific
therapeutic targeting of the stress response can beneficially alter the course of cardiovascular disease. In summary, our data provide
new insights into how acute mental stress elevates vascular inflammation and may promote acute coronary syndromes.
