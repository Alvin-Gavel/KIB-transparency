The use of non-vitamin K antagonist
oral anticoagulants (NOAC) in
patients with bioprosthetic valves
(BV) is controversial. Generally,
NOAC may be indicated in patients
with BV associated with atrial fibrillation (AF) after 3 months following
surgery to reduce the thromboembolic risk related to AF, but not
to the BV itself.
An 86-year-old patient with a history of aortic and mitral valve
replacement with BV, paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation, and chronic kidney
disease developed NYHA Class III
dyspnoea 8 years after surgery,
while he was under treatment with
rivaroxaban 15 mg.
Transthoracic echocardiogram
showed high transmitral bioprosthetic gradients, and thus transoesophageal echocardiography was per
formed (Panels A-D). (Panel A) Midoesophageal long-axis view showing
an isoechoic mass arising from the
BV and limiting the opening of valve
cusps. (Panel B) Transprosthetic gradient, in sinus rhythm. (Panel C)
Atrial 3D-view of the huge atrial
mass, adherent to the valve, and the left atrial wall. (Panel D) Ventricular 3D-view of BV, 3D-valve area was 0.8 cm2.
Cardiac magnetic resonance was performed to characterize the left atrial mass. (Panel E) Cine-MR-image of the huge bat-like mass.
(Panel F) Late gadolinium enhancement sequence with the typical dark appearance of the thrombus.
Anti-Xa activity was measured before switching to Vitamin K antagonists (VKA), and the value was consistent with active rivaroxaban
therapy.
Even if current guidelines suggest the use of NOAC in patients with BV (EHRA type II valvular heart disease), mitral BV have high
thrombo-embolic risk, especially several years after surgery, when switch to VKA should be considered.
