Aims

To compare coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for treatment
of patients with heart failure due to ischaemic heart disease.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
We analysed all-cause mortality following CABG or PCI in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and multiand results
vessel disease (coronary artery stenosis >50% in >_2 vessels or left main) who underwent coronary angiography between

2000 and 2018 in Sweden. We used a propensity score-adjusted logistic and Cox proportional-hazards regressions and instrumental variable model to adjust for known and unknown confounders. Multilevel modelling was used to adjust for the clustering of observations in a hierarchical database. In total, 2509 patients (82.9% men) were included; 35.8% had diabetes and
34.7% had a previous myocardial infarction. The mean age was 68.1 +/- 9.4 years (47.8% were >70 years old), and 64.9% had
three-vessel or left main disease. Primary designated therapy was PCI in 56.2% and CABG in 43.8%. Median follow-up time
was 3.9 years (range 1 day to 10 years). There were 1010 deaths. Risk of death was lower after CABG than after PCI [odds
ratio (OR) 0.62; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41-0.96; P = 0.031]. The risk of death increased linearly with quintiles of hospitals in which PCI was the preferred method for revascularization (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.17-1.38, Ptrend < 0.001).

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
In patients with ischaemic heart failure, long-term survival was greater after CABG than after PCI.

Introduction
Ischaemic heart disease is the most common cause of heart failure
(HF), accounting for approximately two-thirds of all HF cases.1,2
Routine revascularization provides superior outcomes compared with
optimal medical therapy (OMT) alone, and current European and
American guidelines recommend an invasive approach in addition to
OMT in patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)
and multivessel disease (MVD).3,4 Randomized controlled trials in
these patients have proven that long-term survival is greater following
coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) than with OMT alone.5,6
However, the effects of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in
patients with HF and concomitant MVD have not been evaluated in a
randomized setting. While European guidelines encourage revascularization with PCI based on observational studies,3 American guidelines
deem the available evidence for PCI insufficient.4 Furthermore, direct
comparisons between PCI and CABG in the context of ischaemic HF
are limited to observational studies with inconclusive results.7-9 Thus,
the optimal revascularization strategy remains a matter of debate.
Our aim was to evaluate the association between CABG vs. PCI and
mortality in a national cohort of patients with HF and concomitant MVD.

Methods
Study population
We included all patients who underwent coronary angiography with the primary indication of HF corresponding to International Classification of

..
.. Diseases (ICD) 10th revision codes I50.1 (left ventricular failure), I50.2 [sys.. tolic (congestive) HF], I50.4 [combined systolic (congestive) and diastolic
..
.. (congestive) HF], or I50.9 (HF, unspecified) and that showed concomitant
.. MVD (coronary artery stenosis >50% in >_2 vessels or left main) between 1
.. January 2000 and 31 March 2018. No patient was hospitalized for acute cor..
.. onary syndrome (i.e. ST-elevation or non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction)
.. within the 6 months before the index coronary angiography. All patients
..
.. were included in the Swedish Coronary Angiography and Angioplasty
.. Registry (SCAAR) and Swedish Register of Information and Knowledge
..
.. about Swedish Heart Intensive Care Admissions (RIKS-HIA), which are part
.. of the Swedish Web-System for Enhancement and Development of
..
.. Evidence-Based Care in Heart Disease Evaluated According to
.. Recommended Therapies (SWEDEHEART) registry and was established in
..
.. 1992. Swedish Coronary Angiography and Angioplasty Registry provides a
.. web-based platform dedicated to data collection from all angiographies and
.. PCIs performed in coronary catheterization laboratories (n = 31) in Sweden
..
.. (https://www.ucr.uu.se/swedeheart/). Each catheterization procedure is
.. described with 50 angiographic and 200 PCI, demographic- and proced..
.. ure-related variables. The registry is financed by the county councils in
.. Sweden and the Swedish state and provides 100% procedure coverage in
..
.. Sweden. To obtain information about vital status of the patients, the SCAAR
.. database is continuously merged with the national population registry. More
..
.. detailed information about SCAAR's organization has been published else.. where.10-14 The study was approved by the ethics committee at the
.. University of Gothenburg (Dnr. 759-13, date of approval 6 May 2014).

admissions in Sweden since 1987. Patients were considered to have diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, previous myocardial infarction, or
previous stroke, according to ICD codes.12 Standard definitions were
used for procedure-related information. Only Swedish residents with a
unique 10-digit personal identification number were included. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. Vital status and date of death
were obtained from the Swedish national population registry until 31
March 2018. The population registry in Sweden has nearly 100% completeness within 30 days15; however, it is not reviewed or adjudicated to
establish cardiac vs. non-cardiac causes of death.

Continuous variables are presented as median and interquartile range
(IQR) and categorical variables as frequencies. The normal distribution of
variables was assessed by inspecting the distribution of values on histograms and by the Shapiro-Wilk test. Intergroup differences in continuous
variables were tested by linear regression. Differences in categorical variables were tested by logistic regression.
Missing data were imputed using the multiple imputation chain-equation method16 with five data sets. The calendar year, an indicator of missingness, and an event indicator were included as regular variables.
Continuous variables were imputed by ordinary least-squares multiple
regression, binary variables by logistic regression, and categorical variables by multinomial logistic regression. The imputation procedure and
subsequent analyses were done according to Rubin's protocol17 under
the assumption that missing data are missing at random.
The primary aim of the data analysis was to determine whether the
long-term probability of death differed significantly between patients who
underwent revascularization with PCI or CABG. Event rates were based
on Kaplan-Meier estimates in time-to-first-event analyses. The proportionality of hazards was assessed by including treatment-time interaction
in the Cox proportional-hazards regression. However, the underlying assumption of proportional hazards in the Cox model through follow-up
was not met (treatment-time interaction, P < 0.001). Principal comparisons between treatments were therefore performed by propensity
score-adjusted logistic regression with follow-up time included as a logtransformed offset variable, with the use of an estimated standard error
for the difference. In a post hoc analysis, we evaluated piecewise hazards
models separately within 0-3 and 3-10 years, intervals during which proportional hazards were preserved. Given the presence of non-proportional hazards, net treatment effects were also examined with the use of
post hoc restricted mean survival time and milestone analyses. Restricted
mean event-free survival time is the mean time free from an outcome
event adjusted for loss to follow-up, reflecting the area under the survival
curve.18 For milestone analysis, the percentage of patients with an event
in each group was estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method, and
Greenwood's formula was used to estimate standard errors.19 The difference between groups in the restricted mean survival time and milestone
analysis at 10-year follow-up is reported. We used restricted mean survival time to estimate 'lost survival time', depending on the hospital preference for PCI or CABG as a revascularization method.
Propensity score models were used to adjust for differences in patient
characteristics. Significant predictors of revascularization method for
each patient were identified by fitting a logistic regression model with (i) a
binary-dependent variable representing PCI or CABG and (ii) candidate
variables consisting of the patient-related predictors of the type of revascularization. The variables in Table 1, calendar year of treatment, and hospital were entered into the logistic model. The estimated propensity
score was then used for kernel-based matching20 (based on
Epanechnikov function and bandwidth of 0.06) in logistic regression,
which was the primary statistical model. Kernel-based matching applies a

.. non-linear (logit) multiple regression model of the probability and is less
..
.. sensitive to possible misspecification of the treatment assignment and to
.. violations of positivity assumptions. A frailty term with gamma distribu..
.. tion was included to account for the hierarchical clustering of patients
.. within hospitals.
..
..
.. Sensitivity analysis
..
.. For sensitivity analyses, we used modelling with propensity score based
.. on the inverse probability of treatment weighting and instrumental vari.. able analysis.21-23 We used instrumental variable analysis to reduce bias
..
.. due to unmeasured and unknown confounders. This method is a post hoc
.. analytic technique based on statistical principles similar to those used in
..
.. the analysis of randomized controlled trials.21,24,25 To use instrumental
.. variable analysis, one must identify a naturally varying phenomenon in the
..
.. observed data, which like the act of randomization in a randomized con.. trolled trial, predicts the treatment that will be assigned to the individual
.. patient. To become a valid instrument, a variable must fulfil some neces..
.. sary criteria. First, it must be strongly associated with the received treat.. ment. Second, it must not be associated directly or indirectly with the
..
.. outcome, except through the effect of the treatment itself. The variable
.. with these statistical qualities is called instrumental variable, or instru.. ment. We used an instrument based on the preference for the use of PCI
..
.. or CABG at the level of individual hospitals. To create this treatment.. preference instrument, we divided hospitals into quintiles based on the
..
.. total number of procedures in which CABG was used for each year dur.. ing the study period. Hospital preference is frequently employed as in..
of variable usually fulfils the theoretical
.. strument because this type 26-28
.. criteria for a valid instrument. Variations in the use of the treatment
.. strategy over time in Sweden is a result of changes in guidelines and reim..
.. bursement policies as well as changes in physicians' preference due to the
.. release of new effectiveness and safety information. Since the instrument
..
.. was hospital-based, it might retain an association with the study out.. comes, as the quality of care and outcomes are known to vary with a hos.. pital.29,30 To mitigate any such association, we controlled for measured
..
.. hospital characteristics, including size, and teaching vs. non-teaching
.. hospital.
..
Durbin-Wu-Hausman specification test was used to evaluate the
..
.. presence of residual confounding (endogeneity). The validity of the in..
.. strumental variable was tested with the Sargan test. To test for the
.. strength of the instruments, we examined the partial F test from the first.. stage regression, which predicts treatment as a function of instrument
..
.. and covariates. The partial F-test has the null hypothesis that the coeffi.. cient for the effect of the instrument in the first-stage regression model is
..
.. zero.31 An F-statistic greater than 10 indicates that the instrument is not
.. weak. Reported standard errors from instrumental variable two-stage
.. least squares (2SLS) regression are robust and account for the clustering
..
.. of patients within hospitals using the sandwich estimator. Our primary
.. model was based on instrumental variable 2SLS regression.21 The out..
.. come (dependent) variable in the 2SLS regressions was all-cause
.. mortality.
..
We conducted E-value analysis to assess the robustness of the associ..
.. ation between the mode of revascularization and all-cause mortality to
.. address unmeasured confounding.32 If the strength of unmeasured con..
.. founding was weaker than indicated by the E-value, then the study result
.. could not be cancelled by unmeasured confounders.
..
..
Goodness-of-fit (calibration) for the propensity score models was
.. assessed with the Hosmer-Lemeshow test and with Groennesby and
..
.. Borgan test for the Cox proportional hazards models. Multicollinearity
.. between the variables in the models was evaluated by calculating the vari.. ance inflation factor. All reported P-values are two-sided and are not
..
. adjusted for multiple testing.

In total, 2509 patients [2080 (82.9%) men and 429 (17.1%) women]
were included in the study; 35.8% had diabetes, and 34.7% had a previous myocardial infarction. The mean age was 68.1 +/- 9.4 years
(47.8% were >70 years old), and 64.9% had three-vessel or left main
disease. The primary designated therapy after coronary angiography
was PCI in 1409 (56.2%) and CABG in 1100 (43.8%) individuals. The
baseline characteristics of the patients are presented in Table 1.
Patients in the PCI group were, on average, 2 years older and were
more likely to have hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, previous myocardial infarction, previous PCI, or previous CABG. Patients in the

CABG group were more likely to have a left main disease. The
groups were balanced regarding sex, body mass index, diabetes, creatine clearance, smoking status, ejection fraction, and medication at
discharge. The majority of patients revascularized with PCI received
drug-eluting stents (Table 2). Waiting time from angiography to revascularization was shorter in the PCI group (median 2 days; IQR 1-5)
than in the CABG group (median 11 days; IQR 5-18, P < 0.001).
There were no deaths during the waiting time between coronary
angiography and revascularization.
The number of revascularized patients with PCI or CABG
increased by 7.5% per calendar year (Ptrend < 0.001; Figure 1A).
Between 2000 and 2008, CABG was the preferred method for revascularization. In 2009, PCI surpassed CABG as the preferred method.
The number of revascularized patients with PCI increased by 13.3%
per calendar year (Ptrend < 0.001), and in 2018 PCI was used 3.4 times
more often than CABG. There was a considerable variation between
hospitals in the preference for procedures, ranging from 27% to 86%
of all procedures for PCI and from 14% to 73% of all procedures for

CABG (P < 0.001) (Figure 1B). An additional 1150 patients who had
HF and MVD during the study period did not receive either PCI or
CABG but were treated medically. Percutaneous coronary intervention increased annually by 13.6% [95% confidence interval (CI) 12.1-
15.1, P < 0.001] compared with CABG and by 14.3% (95% CI 12.7-
15.8, P < 0.001) compared with medical treatment.

Clinical outcome
The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. Median follow-up time
was 3.9 years (range 1 day to 10 years). Over the study period, there
were 1010 (40.5%) deaths. Coronary artery bypass grafting was associated with a lower risk of death compared with PCI [odds ratio
(OR) 0.62; 95% CI 0.41-0.96; P = 0.031] (Figure 2A). In piecewise hazards models, CABG did not associate with risk of death at 3 years
(HR 0.79; 95% CI 0.62-1.00; P = 0.052) but was associated with a
lower risk of death between 3 and 10 years after treatment (hazard
ratio 0.72; 95% CI 0.55-0.96; P = 0.027) (Figure 2B). Analyses of the
restricted mean (Figure 2C) and milestones survival time (Figure 2D)
showed that the benefit of CABG increased gradually starting 4 years
after revascularization. Mean event-free survival was 0.59 years (95%
CI 0.21-0.98) longer after CABG than after PCI (P = 0.002) over
10 years. We found significant effect modification between diabetes
and CABG (Pinteraction = 0.041, Figure 3). There was no interaction between the revascularization method and age, sex, calendar year, and
the severity of coronary artery disease (Figure 3). The risk of death
increased (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.17-1.38, Ptrend < 0.001) linearly with
quintiles of hospitals in which PCI was the preferred method for
revascularization (Supplementary material online, Figure S1).

The most important result of this study-the superior outcome

..
. Our finding that CABG was more favourable for patients with

2662

S. Volz et al.

diabetes mellitus is congruent with data from previous studies.34,35
The survival curves started to separate after 4 years, thus reflecting
the timeline of events from the STICH trial. The late departure of the
curves in the STICH trial was explained by an early increase in periprocedural mortality of CABG, which was then offset by beneficial
effects of the surgical revascularization.6 Our study shows that this
timeline is similar even for the comparison between CABG and PCI
and confirms previously demonstrated robustness of surgical revascularization in patients with MVD, with and without HF.34-36 The
lower risk of death with CABG translates on average into 0.5 years of
event-free survival time over 10 years. However, the gain in eventfree survival time decreases substantially with shorter life expectancy.
Given the risk-benefit of CABG vs. PCI, this information should be
considered wisely during the decision-making process within heart
teams as well as for informed consent to patients.
Due to the observational nature of our study, we cannot establish
a causal relationship on the basis of the present analysis. However,
previous studies have shown that the beneficial long-term outcome
of CABG in comparison with PCI may be mediated by a higher degree of completeness of revascularization and lower risk for future
myocardial infarction-a finding which has been consistent in several
major studies.37-39 Also, different from PCI, CABG targets both
flow-limiting and no-flow-limiting stenoses, the latter being responsible for a significant proportion of future myocardial infarction.40,41
Our findings contrast results in an observational study from the
USA of comparable size and design. Using data from a New York
registry, Bangalore et al. assessed outcomes of PCI vs. CABG in
patients with reduced LVEF. They found no statistical difference in
all-cause mortality between the two treatment strategies.7 However,
the follow-up time in their study was limited to a median of 2.9 years

compared with 3.9 years in our study. With a follow-up time up to
10 years, our study provides a significant extension resulting in a
three-fold higher number of events. Consequently, the substantially
higher number of events generates greater statistical power to detect
a difference in mortality and may, therefore, explain the discrepancy
between the two studies. Our study is congruent with Sun et al.,42
who recently reported that CABG was associated with better longterm survival based on data from the Ontario province. However,
the most important differences between our study and the Ontario
study are (i) we used an unselected population from one whole nation, and (ii) we confirmed our results by modelling with instrumental
variable analysis, which is one of the best methods to account for residual confounding in observational studies. Moreover, our data are
supported by results from a recently published meta-analysis in which
CABG, PCI, and OMT were compared in the setting of ischaemic
HF.8 Wolff et al. performed a comprehensive, pooled analysis of 3
randomized and 18 observational studies, which showed a survival
benefit of CABG compared with PCI in patients with ischaemic HF.
Over the 19 years of this study, there was a steady rise of revascularization procedures in patients with ischaemic HF in Sweden. While
the use of CABG remained stable over the past decade, PCI procedures increased continuously at a steep rate of 13.3% per year, thus
surpassing CABG and ultimately tripling in rate compared with
CABG in the most recent years. However, this development is not
supported by the current guidelines and available evidence.3 One explanation for this trend may be the extrapolation of the findings from
the STICH study by physicians presuming a class effect of coronary
revascularization. Also, we noted a considerable variation in the preference of revascularization modality across the 31 study centres in
Sweden with PCI/CABG ratios ranging from 0.2 to 5. Indeed, patients

patients with percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting increased by 7.5% per calendar year (Ptrend < 0.001). Between
2000 and 2008, coronary artery bypass grafting was the preferred method for revascularization of patients with ischaemic heart failure in Sweden. In
2009, percutaneous coronary intervention became the preferred revascularizaton method. The number of revascularized patients with percutaneous
coronary intervention increased by 13.3% per calendar year (Ptrend < 0.001). In 2018, percutaneous coronary intervention was used 3.4 times more
often than coronary artery bypass grafting. (B) Number of percutaneous coronary intervention and coronary artery bypass grafting per hospital

CABG and PCI in ischaemic heart failure

with ischaemic HF treated in hospitals in which PCI was the preferred
revascularization method had higher long-term mortality and significant loss in survival time. A similar finding was reported previously
when comparing Swedish hospitals in general.43 Factors that are important determinants of treatment preference among decision-making physicians include a lack of high-quality evidence comparing PCI
and CABG in the setting of HF, local tradition, technical expertise,
and access to a surgical unit. Other reasons for the discrepancy between guidelines and clinical practice have been investigated and include operator-specific inertia of previous practice, lack of familiarity,
and disagreement with current guidelines.44 Data from other

countries are scarce, but the same trend is reflected in one previous
study which identified PCI to be the most common revascularization
method in US patients with HF and MVD.45
Data from randomized controlled trials investigating PCI in ischaemic HF will not be available for some time. The results from the ongoing REVIVED (REVascularization for Ischaemic VEntricular
Dysfunction) trial, which assesses the comparative effectiveness of
PCI vs. OMT in patients with reduced systolic LVEF,46 are not
expected before 2023. Of note, the REVIVED trial does not include a
CABG arm and focuses only on patients who are not eligible for surgery. There are ongoing initiatives for a pivotal, head-to-head

comparison of PCI and CABG in ischaemic HF. Data from our observational study may provide valuable information for the planning of
such a study.
Several limitations need to be addressed. The present study is
based on an intention-to-treat analysis, and thus a minority of the
included patients may have eventually crossed over to a different
revascularization modality. We do not have data about New York
Heart Association class, Canadian Cardiovascular Society class, or
SYNTAX score. Lack of data about implantable cardioverter-defibrillator/cardiac resynchronization therapy is a major limitation. As our
patient inclusion was based on diagnostic coding only, data resolution
did not allow differentiation between reversible and irreversible alteration in cardiac structure and function. We do not present outcome data for patients treated medically because of the difficulty in
ascertaining whether HF was primarily due to ischaemic heart disease
or cardiomyopathy. In a number of medically treated patients, there
was an apparent and sizeable discrepancy between the extent and
grade of impairment of left ventricular function and the area at risk
supplied by the coronary arteries with significant stenoses (i.e. vessels
<2 mm), which suggests that cardiomyopathy rather than ischaemic
heart disease is the primary cause of HF. Many patients treated medically were unsuitable for revascularization due to coronary anatomy
or high procedural risk. A recent meta-analysis by Bangalore et al.47
evaluating the importance of revascularization vs. medical treatment
in stable coronary artery disease patients without HF did not demonstrate prognostic benefit from revascularization therapy irrespective
of type. However, the effect of revascularization therapy vs. medical
treatment in patients with HF differs from stable coronary artery disease. The STICH trial has established the superiority of CABG over

..
.. medical treatment. The remaining question is whether revasculariza.. tion with PCI confers beneficial prognostic effects similar to CABG.
..
.. A substantial number of patients were revascularized with an older
.. stent generation and without intracoronary evaluation with a pres..
.. sure-wire. We acknowledge that the observational design of our
.. study carries an inherent risk for residual confounding. However,
..
.. stringent statistical modelling with propensity score method and in.. strumental variable analysis has minimized the risk of substantial bias
..
.. in risk estimates. Indeed, the quantification of residual confounding
.. with E-value32 confirmed the robustness against bias. The events in
..
.. the study were not independently adjudicated. However, regular ex.. ternal monitoring and data validation are performed in
..
.. SWEDEHEART and have previously shown high data accuracy.14
..
.. Our data do not allow the differentiation between cardiac and non.. cardiac death. All-cause death is a robust, clinically significant end..
.. point and, in contrast to cause-specific death, it does not require a
.. complex adjudication process. Administrative databases reliably cap..
.. ture death events in Sweden, and nearly 100% of all deaths are regis.. tered within the first month.15
..
..
In conclusion, in patients with ischaemic HF, CABG was associated
.. with superior long-term survival compared with PCI. This finding was
..
.. supported by centre-level data showing that inclination towards per.. forming PCI rather than CABG was associated with a worse progno..
.. sis. However, PCI is still the preferred revascularization method in
..
.. the majority of Swedish hospitals in these patients. Our study sup.. ports the current European and American guidelines for revasculari..
.. zation of patients with HF due to ischaemic heart disease.3,4 There is
.. a need for a randomized trial to resolve the question of which revas..
.. cularization method should be the treatment of choice for patients
.. with ischaemic HF.
