Security in BioMedical Research publications

Introduction
Plagiarism and other forms of intellectual theft are far more common
in science than one would like to think.1,2 Several ways to have access
to a scientist's intellectual property exist. In this context, intellectual
property means all relevant information shared when a person submits
an article. This includes the manuscript, access to all the data recorded
and processed during the study that permits the checking of the results
in the article. It also includes the author's history of submission and
reviewing tasks in that journal. One source of potential intellectual
property breach and an effective way to have access to the submission
data of a scientist (which is the main concern of this article) is having
permanent access to the scientist's account, even if they reset the password. This is unfortunately allowed directly by the submission platform of several journals (see Table 1).

The challenge
The steps following a manuscript submission involve a notification of
manuscript submission and thereafter a decision letter. While these
notifications are widely shared among co-authors, they often, if not always, include a link that automatically logs the co-author into the

Table 1

account of the corresponding author. Although this link may be
accompanied by a warning message such as: 'Do not share this
encrypted link with others, as it will automatically log you into your account for X-based system'. We find that this link does not allow for
the extra layer of security needed for the corresponding author.
Table 1 shows the e-mail including a warning message by selected
Journals.
This encrypted shared URL allows someone to log on to the account of the owner (i.e. corresponding author) 'forever' even if the individual resets their password afterwards. This implies that an
individual with a conflict of interest or a potential hacker can easily
track someone's submissions, in clear violation of the individual privacy.
Even more alarming is that it is well known that hacking has become
the leading cause of breaches reported by Content Management
Systems.3 Uses of web-based applications for email, messaging, and file
storage come with a risk of compromise of sensitive data, identity
theft, compromise, or theft of intellectual property (such as metadata,
research protocols, and preliminary results).3 In this context, where
anyone can access researcher's accounts using a single link, the effect
of hacking may last for long periods.
Experience demonstrates that warning the co-author may not be
sufficient enough as deleting a section of the email, while sharing the
decision with the co-authors may even be considered as suspicious by

Improve platforms for submission of articles for better data protection and
scientific integrity for the authors

2142

o Privacy for the user should be the number one concern for the
product, technology, or service. The goal is to provide a user-

centric experience, rather than one which harbours illicit data processing practices such as mass collection of data or invasive profiling.
o The basic idea is that consideration of the impact of any processing
activities when developing a new product, technology, or service
should be considered and from the onset and through the lifecycle
of the product. Measures should be integrated into the project.
o A need to act quickly to understand the new regulatory requirement and embrace them in order to ensure their products and
services are compliant for the brave, new, GDPR world.

Conclusion
While privacy and security in the era of digital health is a major issue, a
major limitation to our own privacy relies on one of the most performed task of scientists to advance the field: submissions. We rely on
the process of manuscript submission and the peer-review tracking
system provider, as well as the journals to protect the customer (the
Scientists).
As the old saying goes 'prevention is better than cure'-we therefore think that 'prevention is better than punished scientific misconducts'. We will consider this submission a success if just once instance
highlighted in this viewpoint prevents data privacy violation or theft of
a scientist's intellectual property.

our peers. All the more so, since there is an underlying trust between
co-authors.
While a high level of trust between co-authors during manuscript
submission is quite common, a major problem with providing coauthors with a login link to corresponding author accounts is that 'a
co-author today may not be a friend tomorrow'. Communication
among co-authors breaks down and stops because of personality conflicts, professional rivalries, or jealousies and several examples of conflicts among co-authors are documented.4 A major challenge after
terminating a collaboration may be the protection of the confidential
topics and data the collaborators used to share as they mostly keep
having common research topics of interest. The aim then of any reform of the policies in question that this viewpoint raises, is to avoid
collaborators take primary or even exclusive credit for ongoing works
just because they still have a way to follow previous colleague
submissions.
It is worth highlighting that this is not an isolated problem as wide
used manuscript submission and peer-review tracking systems for scientific, technical, medical, and engineering publications would argue.
We identified eJournalPress as being the provider of the software.
eJournalPress platforms generate. It is also useful to specify that other
respected software platforms do not have these problems (Editorial
Manager5 or Scholarone6).
From this perspective, methods for controlling the access to article
submission is needed for all platforms. Some solutions could be (i) to
create links that will expire after a defined period or (ii) to create a link
that will not log into the account if the person changes their password.
In fact, recently, Elsevier (publisher of important scientific journals) declared that their server was accessible from the internet with Email
addresses and passwords being public for some time. They resolved
the issue and advised scientists with an account at Elsevier to change
their password.7 This solution would not be an option with
eJournalPress as even after resetting the password the submission link is
still available to log into the researcher's account.
The European Union regulation 2016/679 on General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR) now formally requires organizations to
take privacy into account by design from the conception of a new
product, technology or service (Article 25), rather than on a voluntary
basis as it was under the previous regime of Directive 95/46/EC (recital
46). Their Data protection by design concept call for a satisfaction of
the following requirements:
