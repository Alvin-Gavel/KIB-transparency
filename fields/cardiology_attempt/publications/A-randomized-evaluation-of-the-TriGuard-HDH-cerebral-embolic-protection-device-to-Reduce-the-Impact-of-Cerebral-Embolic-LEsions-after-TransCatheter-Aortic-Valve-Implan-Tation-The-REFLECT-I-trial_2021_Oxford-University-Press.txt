Aims

The REFLECT I trial investigated the safety and effectiveness of the TriGuardTM HDH (TG) cerebral embolic deflection device in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
This prospective, multicentre, single-blind, 2:1 randomized (TG vs. no TG) study aimed to enrol up to 375 patients,
and results
including up to 90 roll-in patients. The primary combined safety endpoint (VARC-2 defined early safety) at 30 days
was compared with a performance goal. The primary efficacy endpoint was a hierarchical composite of (i) all-cause
mortality or any stroke at 30 days, (ii) National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) worsening at 2-5 days or
Montreal Cognitive Assessment worsening at 30 days, and (iii) total volume of cerebral ischaemic lesions detected by
diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging at 2-5 days. Cumulative scores were compared between treatment
groups using the Finkelstein-Schoenfeld method. A total of 258 of the planned, 375 patients (68.8%) were enrolled
(54 roll-in and 204 randomized). The primary safety outcome was met compared with the performance goal (21.8%
vs. 35%, P < 0.0001). The primary hierarchical efficacy endpoint was not met (mean efficacy score, higher is better:
-5.3 +/- 99.8 TG vs. 11.8 +/- 96.4 control, P = 0.31). Covert central nervous system injury was numerically lower with TG
both in-hospital (46.1% vs. 60.3%, P = 0.0698) and at 5 days (61.7 vs. 76.2%, P = 0.054) compared with controls.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
REFLECT I demonstrated that TG cerebral protection during TAVR was safe in comparison with historical TAVR
data but did not meet the predefined effectiveness endpoint compared with unprotected TAVR controls.

Introduction
Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a well-established
alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement for patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis across the spectrum of surgical
risk.1,2 Beyond offering a lesser-invasive approach, an important
benefit of TAVR may be lower stroke rates compared with surgical
aortic valve replacement, as observed in recent randomized trials.
The decline in stroke rates over time is likely related to a combination of advances in TAVR devices, operator experience, and treatment of lower-risk patients. Nevertheless, stroke remains the most
common ischaemic complication following TAVR, with a roughly 2-
6% peri-procedural stroke risk.3-10 Moreover, covert or silent ischaemic brain injury detected by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance

Cerebral

imaging (DW-MRI) affects 85-100% of patients after TAVR11-13 as a
result of cerebral embolization during the TAVR procedure.14,15
Balloon post-dilation, valve manipulation and migration, and longer
procedure times predict procedure-related strokes,16 suggesting that
interactions between the transcatheter valve system and the aorta
and calcified native valve are the primary mechanism of peri-procedural cerebral embolization and acute stroke. Stroke carries a heavy
morbidity and mortality burden and significant health economic implications.17-19 The clinical significance of acutely silent cerebral injury is
poorly characterized in TAVR patients, but has been linked to cognitive decline, subsequent dementia,20 and stroke risk in other clinical
settings.21
Because early strokes and cerebral injury are primarily embolic
and procedure-related, the use of cerebral embolic protection (CEP)

devices during TAVR may offer benefit. Previously reported studies
have evaluated the safety and feasibility of the TriGuardTM embolic
deflection device for preventing cerebral embolization during
TAVR.22,23 The REFLECT I trial (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT025
36196) was designed to prospectively evaluate the safety and efficacy
of TriGuard HDH (TG) cerebral deflection during TAVR.

Methods
The executive committee designed and oversaw the conduct and analysis
of the trial in collaboration with the Sponsor (Keystone Heart, Tampa,
FL, USA). The trial was conducted and reported in accordance with the
protocol, FDA regulations, ICH-GCP guidelines, and the Declaration of
Helsinki. The ethics committee approved the research protocol at each
centre and every subject, or their legal representative, provided written
informed consent prior to any study-specific procedure or assessments.
The safety of patients in the trial was overseen by an independent Data
Safety Monitoring Board (DSMC), and an independent Clinical Events
Committee (CEC) adjudicated all potential endpoint events. Statistical
analyses were performed by an independent statistician (Helen Parise
LCC). The first author prepared the first draft of the manuscript. All coauthors reviewed the manuscript and provided input, vouched for the accuracy of the data, and agreed to submit the manuscript for publication.
The study data is not available for public access.

Patient population
Patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis referred for TAVR
were eligible for participation in the trial. Exclusion criteria included recent (<72 h) acute myocardial infarction, recent (<6 months) stroke or
transient ischaemic attack, cardiogenic shock, impaired renal function
(glomerular filtration rate <30 mL/min/1.73 m2), history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy or contraindications to antiplatelet or anticoagulant
therapy, and prior prosthetic valve implantation (including planned aortic
valve-in-valve procedure). Potential subjects were also excluded if they
had known hypersensitivity to device component materials or contrast
that could not be adequately pre-medicated, severe peripheral artery disease that precluded vascular access, a severely atheromatous aortic arch,
contraindications to cerebral MRI, planned cardiac intervention during or
within 10 days prior to TAVR, or if treatment with any other investigational device or procedure was planned during the study period. An independent computed tomography core laboratory and a patient screening
committee reviewed the clinical and anatomic suitability of all patients for
the trial.

Trial procedures
Patients meeting eligibility criteria were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio
to TG or control using a web-based block randomization system.
Randomization was stratified by site and transcatheter heart valve type
(balloon-expandable vs. self-expanding). To allow for a learning curve
with this new device, up to three-proctored roll-in cases were performed
at centres whose investigators did not have prior experience with the TG
device. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement was performed with commercial transcatheter valve systems according to standard institutional
procedures under local or general anaesthesia. Dual antiplatelet therapy
with aspirin and clopidogrel was recommended for 6 months. The TG
embolic deflection device (Keystone Heart Ltd, Caesarea, IL, USA) is a
temporary, single-use filter made of a fine nickel-titanium alloy mesh,
delivered through a contralateral 9 Fr femoral arterial sheath that accommodates the pigtail catheter and therefore does not require additional

.. access. Under fluoroscopic guidance, the TG device is positioned in the
..
.. aortic arch to cover the ostia of the three major cerebral arteries (innom.. inate, left common carotid, and subclavian), and anchored in place by a
..
.. stabilizer positioned in the proximal innominate artery (Graphical ab.. stract). The filter maintains cerebral blood flow through 130  250 mm
.. pores while deflecting larger emboli to the descending aorta. The TG is
..
.. intended to be positioned in the aortic arch prior to TAVR delivery, main.. tained in position for the duration of the TAVR procedure, and with..
.. drawn after completion of the procedure.
..
Enrolled patients underwent detailed clinical and neurologic assess..
.. ments at baseline, before discharge or 2-5 days, and at 30 and 90 days
.. after the procedure. Neurologic assessments were performed by a
.. board-certified neurologist blinded to DW-MRI findings and treatment al..
.. location and included the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale
.. (NIHSS) and the Modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Cognitive evaluation
..
.. included the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)24 and Repeatable
.. Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS)25 at
.. all time-points. Brain DW-MRI using a standardized image acquisition
..
.. protocol (1.5 T) was performed 2-5 days post-procedure to define the
.. ischaemic burden of the TAVR procedure by an independent MRI Core
.. Laboratory [Buffalo Neuroimaging Center, Buffalo, NY (BNAC)] using
..
.. validated methods. Supplementary material online, Appendix describes
.. the methodology for brain DW-MRI acquisition and analysis.
..
.. Independent site monitoring was performed for 100% of clinical fields
.. and endpoint events. Procedural angiograms were acquired using a stand.. ard angiographic imaging protocol and reviewed by an independent
..
.. Angiographic Core Laboratory (Yale Cardiovascular Research Group,
.. New Haven, CT, USA) to assess device positioning.
..
..
..
.. Endpoints and outcome measures
..
.. The primary safety endpoint measured at 30 days was defined according
.. to the Valve Academic Research Consortium 2 (VARC-2) as a composite
..
.. of all-cause death, stroke, life-threatening or disabling bleeding, stage 2-3
.. acute kidney injury (AKI), coronary artery obstruction requiring interven.. tion, major vascular complications, and valve-related dysfunction requir..

.. composite of (i) all-cause mortality or any stroke at 30 days, (ii) NIHSS

.. worsening from baseline to 2-5 days post-procedure or MoCA worsen.. ing (decrease of three points or more from baseline) at 30 days, and
.. (iii) total volume of cerebral ischaemic lesions detected by DW-MRI per..
.. formed 2-5 days post-procedure. Cumulative scores based on the
.. Finkelstein-Schoenfeld methodology27 were summed for each subject,
..
.. and outcomes compared between treatment groups, with higher scores

one-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) of the 30-day safety event rate
was significantly less than the performance goal. A sample size of 179
evaluable patients in the intervention group and a one-sided
alpha = 0.05 level was estimated to provide 87.5% power using a onesample z-test for proportions; a 28.5% critical value would be required
to reject the null hypothesis. All primary and secondary safety outcomes were tested in the as-treated population according to the
protocol. As treated for TG was defined as patients having established
arterial access for intended TG use. Patients without TG access were
analysed as controls.
The primary efficacy hypothesis was that TAVR with TG protection
was superior to unprotected TAVR based on the pre-specified hierarchy
of adverse outcomes determined by pairwise comparisons among all subjects according to the Finkelstein-Schoenfeld method.27 Briefly, each

subject in the trial was compared with every other subject based on the
hierarchy. For example, if Subject A dies or has stroke and Subject B survives free of stroke to 30 days, Subject B wins (score th1) and Subject A
loses (score -1). If both subjects die or have a stroke, it is equilibrium
(score 0). If both subjects survive free of stroke to 30 days, the comparison moves to the next tier of the hierarchy. After all between-subject
comparisons have been performed, scores are summed to obtain a cumulative score for each subject, and outcomes between treatment
groups are then compared. Based on estimated event rates for each tier
of the primary efficacy outcomes from 1000 simulated samples
(Supplementary material online, Appendix), a sample size of 285 subjects
(190 in the TG group and 95 in the control group) including a 5% drop
out rate, would provide >90% power to demonstrate superiority of TG,
using the Mann-Whitney U test to compare outcomes between treatment groups. The null hypothesis was tested at a two-sided 0.049 level of
significance allowing for an interim analysis of the first 90 patients, which
was planned for sample size re-estimation to ensure sufficient power for
efficacy.
Hypothesis-driven secondary endpoints were planned to be tested sequentially only if both primary endpoints were met to preserve the alpha
level. The primary efficacy outcome was tested in the efficacy intention to
treat (eITT) population, based on randomized allocation but excluding
patients requiring conversion to surgery or prolonged cardiac arrest
(>3 min) prior to DW-MRI. Continuous variables are presented as mean
+/- standard deviation when the data are approximately normally distributed. Skewed data, such as those obtained via MRI, are presented as median and interquartile range (IQR). Binary variables are described as
frequencies and percentages. Time-to-event data are presented as
Kaplan-Meier estimates to 30 days. Additional post hoc analysis of imaging
outcomes was performed as described in the Supplementary material online, Appendix.

was achieved in 57.3% (78/136), as defined by independent angiographic core laboratory confirmation that the TG device provided
complete coverage of all three cerebral vessels throughout the
TAVR procedure. The device was successfully retrieved intact in all
cases.

Safety outcomes
The primary safety outcome at 30 days occurred in 21.8% (95% CI
15.1-29.8%) of subjects in the TG group, meeting the primary safety
endpoint compared with the pre-specified performance goal of
34.4% (P < 0.001) (Table 3, Graphical abstract). The composite 30-day
safety event rate was significantly higher in the TG group compared
with controls [21.8% vs. 8.5%; relative risk (RR) 2.57, 95% CI 1.05-
6.32; P = 0.025] driven by a significantly higher rate of major vascular
complications (12.3% vs. 1.7%; RR 7.26, 95% CI 0.99-53.48;
P = 0.025), mostly related to TAVR access site major vascular complications that were more common in the TG vs. the control group
(7.1% vs. 0%; RR 4.33, 95% CI 1.04-18.02; P = 0.033) (Table 4). There
were no significant between-group differences in death (P = 1.0),
stroke (P = 0.59), life-threatening bleeding (P = 0.31), or stage 2/3 AKI
at 30 days. These results were consistent at all time-points, including
in-hospital and at 30- and 90-day follow-up. The composite safety
endpoint of all-cause death, stroke, and AKI stage 3 was not significantly different between groups at any time-point (Table 3). In addition, safety outcomes were similar between controls and the 57.3%
of TG patients with device success (all-cause death, stroke, and stage
3 AKI composite 11.5% vs. 6.5%, P = 0.386).

Efficacy outcomes
The primary hierarchical efficacy endpoint was not significantly different between groups, with a mean score (higher is better) of
-5.3 +/- 99.8 for TG and 11.8 +/- 96.4 for controls (P = 0.314), corresponding to a win percentage of 44.6% for TG and 55.4% without
protection in the pre-specified eITT and ITT populations (same populations as no exclusions were met for eITT) (Table 3). Therefore,
the primary efficacy endpoint was not met, and testing of all secondary endpoints was exploratory. Similar results were seen in patients
with complete cerebral coverage (mean score of -2.0 +/- 71.4 for TG
and 2.5 +/- 70.1 for controls, P = 0.766, with a comparable win percentage of 48% vs. 52%). The secondary endpoints of CNS infarction
(P = 0.163), NIHSS worsening from baseline to 30 days (P = 0.435),
and total volume of cerebral ischaemic lesions (P = 0.885) were not

.. significantly different between groups. There was numerically less
..
.. covert CNS injury with TG both in-hospital (46.1% vs. 60.3%,
.. P = 0.0698) and at 5 days (61.7% vs. 76.2%, P = 0.054) compared with
..
.. controls. Similar overall results were found in the 57.3% of patients
.. with device success compared with controls (ischaemic stroke: 6.4%
..
.. vs. 6.5%, P = 1.00; covert strokes: 50% vs. 61.3%, P = 0.231).
.. Neurocognitive screening with MoCA did not demonstrate any dif..
.. ferences in mean scores between groups post-procedure (22.1 +/- 4.4
.. vs. 21.9 +/- 4.2, P = 0.86), at 30 days (22.3 +/- 4.7 vs. 22.5 +/- 4.3, P = 0.96),
..
.. or at 90 days (22.6 +/- 4.7 vs. 22.1 +/- 4.7, P = 0.54). There was no differ..
.. ence in the change in MoCA scores compared with baseline at any
.. time-point (Table 3). The RBANS assessment of overall cognitive
..
.. functioning in five major domains (including immediate memory,
.. visuospatial, language, attention, and delayed memory) revealed no
..
.. differences in the overall scores or sub-scores between groups at any
.. time-point.
..
Brain imaging with DW-MRI was performed in 113/136 patients
..
.. (83.1%), and interpretable in 111/136 TG patients (81.6%) and 58/63
..
.. control patients (93.5%) (Supplementary material online, Appendix).
.. There were no between-group differences in the incidence of ischae..
.. mic lesions or the total lesion volume by DW-MRI at 2-5 days [me.. dian (IQR): 229 mm3 (46-631) TG vs. 235 mm3 (81-484) control;
..
.. P = 0.885] (Table 3). Among patients with full coverage of all three

Discussion

.. 6.8%, P = 0.59); however, this difference was not statistically signifi..
.. cant. Because stroke can be caused by factors other than cerebral
.. embolization, CEP devices cannot be expected to eliminate stroke al..
.. together. Factors that confound peri-procedural stroke comparisons
.. include patient-related factors (e.g. prior stroke, atrial fibrillation, ca..
.. rotid disease), and procedure-related complications (e.g. conversion
.. to surgery, other left-sided procedures, cardiopulmonary resuscita..
.. tion) that can dilute a signal of benefit derived from the CEP device.
..
.. Therefore, surrogate measures of efficacy have been employed to in.. crease the sensitivity to potential benefits. In REFLECT I, CNS infarc..
.. tion in-hospital (46.1% vs. 60.3%, P = 0.06) and at 5 days (61.7 vs.
.. 76.2%, P = 0.054), as well as DW-MRI total lesion volume, numerical..
.. ly favoured the use of TG protection. In addition, among patients
.. with TG device success and compete cerebral coverage throughout
..
.. the TAVR procedure, there was a 26% reduction in total lesion vol.. ume and a more pronounced reduction in larger ischaemic brain
..
.. lesions in the post hoc multi-threshold lesion-wise analysis. While not
.. statistically significant, in aggregate, these results provide supportive
..
.. evidence that TG may provide protection from larger cerebral
.. emboli when complete three-vessel coverage is achieved. While
..
.. many studies have shown that DW-MRI lesion size post-procedure is
.. associated with stroke and postoperative cognitive decline,30-33 the
..
.. modest effects in REFLECT I did not translate into measurable clinic.. al, neurologic, or neurocognitive benefits, and the degree to which
..
.. such effects justify the inherent risks related to vascular access cannot
.. be determined. It should also be noted that while NIHSS worsening

.. was higher in the TG arm, this tool is validated to evaluate patients
.. with suspected stroke rather than serial evaluation in a trial popula..
.. tion for stroke surveillance. Furthermore, the threshold defining a

.. defined.
..
Fundamentally, the REFLECT I trial established that the TG de..
.. vice was not sufficiently stable, with only 57.3% of patients having

.. Observed reasons for lack of coverage included device move.. ment, passage of the TAVR delivery system behind the filter, tan..

The REFLECT I clinical trial demonstrated that cerebral embolic protection with the TG device during TAVR was safe in comparison with
a pre-specified performance goal based on historical data, meeting its
primary safety endpoint. However, TG did not reach its predefined
efficacy endpoint compared with controls in the primary hierarchical
composite of all death and stroke, NIHSS or MoCA worsening, and
total cerebral lesion volume.
The clinical need for CEP is well established; however, adoption
is estimated to be below 10% in clinical practice. Currently, the
Sentinel CEP (Boston Scientific, Natick, MA, USA) is the only US
approved device for use with TAVR. While this device protects
only two of the three cerebral vessels, it demonstrated debris capture without reduction in brain MRI lesion volume, and conclusive
evidence of clinical benefit is still lacking.30 The ideal CEP device
should be safe, easy to position, and require minimal operator attention once in position. To be effective, the device should have
minimal interaction with the TAVR delivery system or other interventional equipment and provide a complete and stable seal of all
cerebral arteries for the entire TAVR procedure. Meeting these
requirements is challenging from the perspectives of both CEP design and clinical evaluation. Determining the safety and effectiveness of CEP is a complex interplay of (i) identifying a narrow
clinical benefit signal in a complex patient population with highly
confounded neurologic outcomes, (ii) making a clear distinction
between events that are attributable to CEP and TAVR or other
adjunctive procedures, and (iii) accounting for CEP-TAVR interactions that are at best difficult to measure.
While the TG met its primary safety endpoint, the composite
safety event rate at 30 days was significantly higher with TG compared with controls (RR 2.57, 95% CI 1.05-6.32). While this result
appears to be primarily driven by a significantly higher rate of TAVRrelated vascular complications in the TG group (RR 4.33, 95% CI
1.04-18.02), other component endpoints of the safety composite,
including death and stroke, were numerically higher with TG compared with controls, and contributions of the device to these multifactorial events cannot be conclusively ruled out. It is important to
note, however, that the study was severely underpowered for a comparison of these infrequent events, and the play of chance cannot be
excluded. In the more narrowly defined safety composite of all-cause
death, stroke, and stage 3 AKI, outcomes were similar between
groups (9.2% vs. 6.3%, P = 0.592). It should also be highlighted that
the control group in REFLECT I had a lower-than-expected event
rate despite having a higher frequency of porcelain aorta, and control
patients experienced no deaths or bleeding complications, which is
not representative of reported outcomes in similar populations. This
may in part be attributed to the small control sample size resulting
from the 2:1 randomization ratio compounded by early termination
of the study.
Regarding efficacy, in this trial, strokes were numerically more
common in the TG group compared with controls overall (10.7% vs.

The REFLECT I trial demonstrated that TG cerebral protection during TAVR was safe compared with a historical performance goal but
did not meet the primary effectiveness endpoint compared with unprotected TAVR. The observed numeric reduction in early covert
central nervous system injury and in larger ischaemic brain lesions
among patients with full three-vessel coverage throughout the procedure suggest potential benefits of embolic deflection when stability
is achieved.
