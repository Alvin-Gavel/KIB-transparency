This issue opens with the position paper entitled 'Emergency department management of patients with adult congenital heart disease: a
consensus paper from the ESC Working Group on Adult Congenital
Heart Disease, the European Society for Emergency Medicine
(EUSEM), the European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery
(EACTS), and the Association for Acute Cardiovascular Care
(ACVC)', authored by Massimo Chessa from the IRCCS Policlinico
San Donato in Milan, Italy and colleagues.1 The authors note that
adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) patients represent a growing
population with increasing use of acute emergency department (ED)
care. Providing comprehensive ED care necessitates an understanding of the most common clinical scenarios to improve morbidity and
mortality in this population. The aim of this position document is to
provide a consensus regarding the management of the most common
clinical scenarios of ACHD patients presenting to the ED.
The issue continues with a focus on ischaemic heart disease.
Nearly 200 million people globally suffer from coronary artery disease (CAD), half of whom initially present with chest pain. The optimal non-invasive diagnostic strategy in patients with suspected stable
angina is clinically important to define yet remains uncertain. CAD is
frequently diagnosed following evaluation of stable chest pain with
anatomical or functional testing.2,3 A more granular understanding of
patient phenotypes that benefit from either strategy may enable personalized testing. In a clinical research article entitled 'A
phenomapping-derived tool to personalize the selection of
anatomical vs. functional testing in evaluating chest pain
(ASSIST)', Evangelos Oikonomou from Yale University School of
Medicine in New Haven, CT, USA and colleagues looked in further
detail into this matter.4 Using participant-level data from 9572
patients undergoing anatomical (n = 4734) vs. functional (n = 4838)

testing in the PROMISE trial, the authors created a topological representation of the study population based on 57 pre-randomization
variables. Within each patient's 5% topological neighbourhood, Cox
regression models provided individual patient-centred hazard ratios
for major adverse cardiovascular events and revealed marked heterogeneity across the phenomap, suggestive of distinct phenotypic
neighbourhoods favouring anatomical or functional testing. Based on
this risk phenomap, the authors employed an extreme gradientboosting algorithm in 80% of the PROMISE population to predict the
personalized benefit of anatomical vs. functional testing using 12
model-derived, routinely collected variables, and created a decision
support tool named ASSIST. In both the remaining 20% of the
PROMISE population and an external validation set consisting of
patients from the SCOT-HEART trial undergoing anatomical-first vs.
functional-first assessment, ASSIST's testing strategy recommendation was associated with a significantly lower incidence of each study's
primary endpoint , as well as of a harmonized endpoint of all-cause
mortality or non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) (Figure 1).
Thus, Oikonomou and colleagues propose a novel phenomappingderived decision support tool to standardize the selection of anatomical vs. functional imaging in the evaluation of stable chest pain, validated in two large and geographically diverse clinical trial populations.
This manuscript is accompanied by a thought-provoking Editorial
from Pamela Douglas from the Duke University Medical Center in
Durham, NC, USA.5 She notes that at each stage, applying dedicated
risk classification tools that can guide management decisions in
proper sequence will improve patient care, starting with clinical risk
algorithms (pooled cohort equations or equivalent) to assist in preventive treatment decisions, followed by the 2019 European Society
of Cardiology pre-test probability for the CAD algorithm, the
PROMISE Minimal Risk Tool, to identify symptomatic patients who
may not require immediate testing, and the ASSIST model to direct
patients needing testing to anatomic vs. functional testing.

was a composite of non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, and CVD/unknown
death. Key secondary outcomes were microvascular composite endpoint, all-cause death, and heart failure. The effect of dulaglutide in
patients with (MET) or without (NOMET) baseline metformin was
evaluated by a Cox regression hazard model further adjusted for factors differing at baseline between MET and NOMET, identified using
backward selection. Compared with MET (81% of patients), NOMET
(19%) were older, leaner, and more often females, with prior CVD
events, heart failure, and renal disease. The effect of dulaglutide on
the primary outcome did not differ in these two groups (interaction P
= 0.18). Findings for key secondary outcomes were similar.
The authors conclude that their analysis suggests that the cardioprotective effect of dulaglutide is unaffected by the baseline use of
metformin therapy. The manuscript is accompanied by an Editorial
by Naveed Sattar from the University of Glasgow in the UK and
Darren McGuire from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical
Center in Dallas, TX, USA.14 The authors point out that with all new
medicines, higher costs are in play and so formal cost-effectiveness
analyses would help determine levels of CV risk beyond which such
drugs should be recommended. This latter point is far from trivial and
was the key difference between ESC and ADA/EASD T2DM treatment algorithms, with the former being far more liberal in its recommending expansion of the use of GLP-1RAs and/or sodium-glucose
transporter protein 2 inhibitors. Indeed, if the ESC guidelines were to
be followed as stated, a substantially higher percentage of patients in
high-income countries would be commenced on such medications,
leading to large hikes in drug expenditure. What is not known, however, is to what extent such extra costs would be offset by better disease outcomes. Thus, if further trials challenge metformin's primacy
in wider groups of patients, it will lead to profound changes in T2DM
therapeutic algorithms.
The improvement in survival of operated patients with congenital
heart disease (CHD) has led to an increasing number of adult patients
with CHD (ACHD), in particular those with more complex disease.
There is general agreement that ACHD patients have special needs.15
In a clinical research article entitled 'Long-term outcomes after
myocardial infarction in middle-aged and older patients
with congenital heart disease: a nationwide study', Maria
Fedchenko from the University of Gothenburg in Sweden, and colleagues sought to describe the risk of MI in middle-aged and older
patients with ACHD, and to evaluate the long-term outcomes after
index MI in patients with ACHD compared with controls.16 A search
of the Swedish National Patient Register identified 17 189 patients
with ACHD (52% male) and 180 131 age- and sex-matched controls
randomly selected from the general population who were born from
1930 to 1970 and were alive at 40 years of age, all followed up until
December 2017 (mean follow-up 23 years). Patients with ACHD
had a 1.6-fold higher risk of MI compared with controls (P < 0.001),
and the cumulative incidence of MI by 65 years of age was 7.4% in
patients with ACHD vs. 4.4% in controls. Patients with ACHD had a
1.4-fold increased risk of experiencing a composite event after the
index MI compared with controls (P < 0.001), driven largely by the
occurrence of new-onset heart failure in 42% of patients with ACHD
vs. 29% of controls.
The authors conclude that recognizing and managing the modifiable cardiovascular risk factors should be of importance to reduce
morbidity and mortality in patients with ACHD. The manuscript is

The Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) score
was developed to evaluate risk in patients with MI. The score applies
clinical variables, the electrocardiogram, and cardiac biomarkers to
estimate risk of future all-cause mortality and MI. The use of the
GRACE 2.0 score in patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute
coronary syndrome (ACS) is recommended for guiding prognosis
across all international guidelines.6,7 In a clinical research article entitled 'Performance of the GRACE 2.0 score in patients with
type 1 and type 2 myocardial infarction', John Hung from the
University of Edinburgh in the UK, and colleagues note that its performance in type 2 MI is uncertain.8 In two cohorts of consecutive
patients presenting to the Emergency Department with suspected
ACS from 10 hospitals in Scotland and a tertiary care hospital in
Sweden including >60 000 patients, the authors calculated the
GRACE 2.0 score to estimate death at 1 year. Discrimination was
evaluated by the area under the receiver operator characteristic
curve (AUC), and compared for those with an adjudicated diagnosis
of type 1 and type 2 MI using DeLong's test. Type 1 MI was diagnosed
in 4981 (10%) and 1080 (5%) patients in Scotland and Sweden, respectively. At 1 year, 720 (15%) and 112 (10%) patients died with an
AUC for the GRACE 2.0 score of 0.83 and 0.85, respectively. Type 2
MI occurred in 1121 (2%) and 247 (1%) patients in Scotland and
Sweden, respectively, with 258 (23%) and 57 (23%) deaths at 1 year.
The AUC in type 2 MI was 0.73 and 0.73 for both cohorts, which was
lower than for type 1 MI in both cohorts (P < 0.001 and P = 0.008,
respectively).
The authors conclude that the GRACE 2.0 score provides good
discrimination for all-cause death at 1 year in patients with type 1 MI,
and moderate discrimination for those with type 2 MI. This manuscript is accompanied by an Editorial authored by Hector Bueno
from the Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares
(CNIC) in Madrid, Spain, and colleagues.9 Bueno et al. conclude that
with the 4th Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction (4UDMI),
we now have better tools for the diagnosis, prognostic assessment,
and risk stratification of patients with troponin elevation, suspected
ACS, and MI.10 However, more clinical research is warranted to validate the use of the classification provided by the 4UDMI in unselected patients, to assess its accuracy and reliability, and to evaluate
its clinical implications. In addition, given the discordance between
the predicted and observed mortality rates at 1 year found in the
study by Hung et al., we need to wonder whether the GRACE 2.0
score may need re-calibration.
The use of GLP-1 receptor agonists (RAs) as initial glucoselowering therapy in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) patients with high risk/
established cardiovascular disease (CVD) is controversial since outcome trials on GLP-1 RAs had metformin as background therapy.11,12
In a clinical research article entitled 'Similar cardiovascular outcomes in patients with diabetes and established or high risk
for coronary vascular disease treated with dulaglutide with
and without baseline metformin', Giulia Ferrannini from the
Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, Sweden and colleagues indicate
that this post-hoc analysis of the Researching Cardiovascular Events
with a Weekly Incretin in Diabetes (REWIND) trial investigated the
effect of dulaglutide on CVD events according to baseline metformin.13 In REWIND, 10 000 T2DM patients (31% with established
CVD and 69% at high CV risk) were randomized (1:1) to dulaglutide
or placebo ion addition to standard of care. The primary outcome

accompanied by an Editorial by Gerhard-Paul Diller and Stefan
Orwat from the University Hospital Muenster in Germany.17 The
authors conclude that significant advances in the treatment of young
patients with congenital heart defects have enabled many to survive
into old age. However, it is important to emphasize the fact that
these patients also have an increased CV risk, which is determined
not only by the classic risk factors, but also by little known, specific
ACHD factors. Nevertheless, risk modification and a healthy lifestyle
including appropriate weight and nutrition as well as physical exercise
must be recommended to all ACHD patients to avoid the detrimental impact on the CV system, particularly on the background of CHD,
as highlighted by the current study.

A State of the Art Review entitled 'Assessment and pathophysiology of microvascular disease: recent progress and
clinical implications' by Stefano Masi from the University of Pisa in
Italy, and colleagues, also appears in this issue.18 The development of
novel, non-invasive techniques and standardization of protocols to
assess microvascular dysfunction has elucidated the key role of
microvascular changes in the evolution of cardiovascular damage, and
their capacity to predict an increased risk of adverse events.19,20
These technical advances parallel the development of novel biological
assays that enabled the ex vivo identification of pathways promoting
microvascular dysfunction, providing novel potential treatment targets for preventing cerebral-cardiovascular disease. In this review,

the authors provide an update of diagnostic testing strategies to detect and characterize microvascular dysfunction and suggestions on
how to standardize and maximize the information obtained from
each microvascular assay. They examine emerging data highlighting
the significance of microvascular dysfunction in the development of
cardiovascular disease manifestations. Finally, Masi and colleagues
summarize the pathophysiology of microvascular dysfunction,
emphasizing the role of oxidative stress and its regulation by epigenetic mechanisms which might represent potential targets for novel
interventions beyond conventional approaches, representing a new
frontier in cardiovascular disease reduction (Figure 2).
The issue is further complemented by Discussion Forum contributions related to the '2020 ESC guidelines for the management
of acute coronary syndromes in patients presenting without persistent ST-segment elevation'.6 In a contribution entitled
'Lesson learnt from the new 2020 ESC guidelines on NSTEACS: when clinical judgement precedes and overpasses
weak recommendations', Giuseppe Damiano Sanna from the
Sassari University Hospital stresses the importance of critically interpreting the Guidelines.21 In a contribution entitled 'Prasugrel over
ticagrelor in non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes: is
it justified?' Chia Siang Kow from the International Medical
University in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and colleagues point out that
they believe that ticagrelor should not be discarded as one of the
antiplatelet options for patients with ACS presenting without persistent ST-segment elevation in whom a decision is made to proceed
with percutaneous coronary intervention.22 Professor Holger Thiele
from the University of Leipzig in Germany and Professor JeanPhilippe Collet from the Sorbonne Universite in Paris, France, who
chaired the Guideline Committee, respond in two separate
comments.23,24
The editors hope that readers of this issue of the European Heart
Journal will find it of interest.
