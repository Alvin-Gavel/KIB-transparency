                <title>ABSTRACT</title>
                <p>Of the 486,000 burn injuries that required medical treatment in the United States in 2016, 40,000 people were hospitalized, with &gt;3,000 fatalities. After burn injury, humans are at increased risk of sepsis and mortality from infections caused by <named-content content-type="genus-species">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</named-content>, an opportunistic pathogen. We hypothesize that systemic events were initiated from the burn that increased the host’s susceptibility to <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content>. A nonlethal 10% total body surface area (TBSA), full-thickness flame burn was performed in CD-1 mice without and with subsequent <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> (strain M2) infection. The 50% lethal dose for subcutaneous infection with <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> M2 at the burn site immediately after the burn decreased by 6 log, with mortality occurring between 18 and 26 h, compared with <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content>-infected mice without burn injury. Bacteria in distal organs were detected by 18 h, concurrent with the onset of clinical symptoms. Serum proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6 [IL-6], IL-1β, gamma interferon, and tumor necrosis factor alpha) and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were first detected at 12 h postburn with infection and continued to increase until death. Directly after burn alone, serum levels of HMGB1, a danger-associated molecular pattern and TLR4 agonist, transiently increased to 50 ng/ml before returning to 20 ng/ml. Burn with <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> infection increased serum HMGB1 concentrations &gt;10-fold (250 ng/ml) at the time of death. This HMGB1-rich serum stimulated TLR4-mediated NF-κB activation in a TLR4 reporter cell line. Treatment of infected burned mice with P5779, a peptide inhibitor of HMGB1, increased the mean survival from 23 to 42 h (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.0001). We conclude that the high level of serum HMGB1, which preceded the increase in proinflammatory cytokines, is associated with postburn mortality.</p>

              <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
              <p>The American Burn Association reported 486,000 burn injuries that required medical treatment in 2016 and that 40,000 of these injuries led to hospitalization. Forty-three percent of these burns were related to flames, with 17,000 burn center admissions and &gt;3,000 deaths. The United States continues to see widespread wildfires that are likely to expose emergency responders and the public to flame-based burns. Burn size and depth are determined by the amount and duration of heat transferred to the skin. When the skin reaches 48°C, cellular death occurs and results in a first-degree burn. Once the temperature exceeds 72°C, the tissue is instantly destroyed (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Burn injuries are classified from first- to third-degree burns, with first-degree burns being superficial, requiring minimal treatment. Third-degree burns, described as full-thickness burns, extend beyond the dermal layers and destroy underlying bone, muscle, and/or tendons, requiring extensive medical intervention that includes skin grafting (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p>
              <p>Individuals who survive large full-thickness burns are at increased risk of developing bacterial infections that may be the result of contamination of the open burn wound outside a clinical setting or from hospital-acquired infections during treatment (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). These bacterial infections can lead to sepsis, which in burn patients differs from non-burn-induced sepsis in that the primary barrier to infection, the skin, is damaged or lost. This increases the period of exposure to opportunistic pathogens while the wound is open and is a source of continual inflammatory signaling at the wound site (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). <named-content content-type="genus-species">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</named-content>, a ubiquitous Gram-negative bacterium, is one of the most common opportunistic pathogens identified from burn wounds (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> does not routinely cause disease in immunocompetent mice or humans. Immunosuppressed patients have a higher likelihood of gastrointestinal colonization with <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> both before and after admittance into the hospital, which increases the likelihood of serious postburn infections (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p>
              <p>Mice have been shown to closely recapitulate immunological transcriptomic responses compared to humans during burn injuries (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Consequently, mouse burn models are routinely used to assess bacterial dissemination and treatment during postburn sepsis. Some of the more common models for producing full-thickness burns in animals are achieved with hot water baths or heated brass rods (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). These methods are ideal for mimicking burns from scalds or touching hot objects but may not fully compare to a flame-inflicted burn. To mimic the events of flame burns, our laboratory performed an ethanol-based flame burn to achieve a full-thickness, 10% total body surface area (TBSA) nonlethal burn, a model that was originally developed in 1975, which revealed that directly after a full-thickness burn, mice are extremely susceptible to subcutaneous (s.c). infection from <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> strain M2 (O5:FlaB) (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). A complete understanding of the immune response to <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> colonization, dissemination, and development of sepsis postburn in CD-1 mice has not been fully achieved. Our findings indicate that alterations in host responses contribute significantly to increased susceptibility to <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> M2 in CD-1 mice post-10% flame burn. HMGB1, a danger-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) previously associated with sepsis (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) and shown to activate TLR4 signaling (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), was released into serum within minutes after the burn, resulting in an increase in TLR4-mediated proinflammatory signaling. Treating mice with P5779, an HMGB1 antagonist, increased the median time of death and survival postburn following an s.c. infection of <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> M2.</p>

                <p>Histological analysis of skin by hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining at the time of the burn, in the absence of infection, produced a full-thickness burn that extended through the epidermal and dermal layers, with complete loss of cellular structure compared to the skin of sham-treated mice. The cutaneous adipose tissue and the panniculus carnosus were spared from injury (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>

                <p>After receiving a 10% TBSA burn, mice were randomly assigned into five groups, each receiving 100 μl subcutaneously of 3.3 × 10<sup>4</sup> CFU <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> M2, 3.3 × 10<sup>4</sup> CFU of heat-killed (HK) <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> M2, 10 pg of <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> M2 lipopolysaccharide (LPS), representative of the LPS content of 10<sup>4</sup> CFU <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> M2, 100 μl phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), or 3.3 × 10<sup>4</sup> CFU <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> M2 in the absence of burn. Mice were observed for clinical signs of sepsis and distress. Only mice that received a 10% TBSA burn and were infected with live <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> M2 became moribund, with the onset of clinical symptoms occurring between 18 and 26 h and a mean time to death of 23 h. Mice in the other groups showed no symptoms, and all survived and continued to gain weight through the end of the experiment at 7 days postburn (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Additionally, mice that received a burn alone gained weight over the course of 7 days after the procedure (data not shown). Another group of mice were burned and infected with 3.3 × 10<sup>4</sup> CFU <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> M2.

                <title>Inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine levels in the serum in response to burn and infection with <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content>.</title>
                <p>We performed serum cytokine analyses to determine the global inflammatory response to burn alone and burn with infection with live <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> M2, heat-killed (HK)-PA M2, or injection of <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> M2 LPS. In burned mice that received an infection with live <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> M2, proinflammatory cytokines gamma interferon (IFN-γ), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) became elevated at the onset of clinical symptoms (12 to 18 h) and remained elevated until the mice required euthanasia (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref> to <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, was also elevated along with the inflammatory cytokines and persisted until euthanasia (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). IL-6 levels were higher than the range of detection in burned mice with infection by 12 hpb (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). In burned mice that did not receive an infection, IL-6 increased at 24 hpb to over 200 pg/ml and returned to undetectable levels by 48 hpb (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Additionally, IL-6 was increased when burned and sham mice were injected with a comparable amount of HK <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> M2. However, the concentration of serum IL-6 in burned mice was lower than that of sham mice after injection with HK <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> M2 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). No cytokine response was observed after injection of 10 pg of <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> M2 LPS in either burned or sham mice (data not shown). We assessed the concentration of activated transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), a cytokine involved in tissue repair and immune suppression (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), in the serum of mice that were burned, without and with an infection, as well as in mice that were infected in the absence of a burn. Although the level of total TGF-β was elevated, we saw no alterations in the activated fraction of TGF-β at any time point postburn without and with infection (data not shown).</p>

                <p>We observed that unburned sham mice were relatively resistant to s.c. <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> M2 infection (50% lethal dose [LD<sub>50</sub>], ∼10<sup>6</sup> CFU) (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In contrast, when burned mice were challenged s.c. with 600 CFU of <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> M2 immediately following the burn and up to 18 hpb, the infection was 100% lethal. When bacterial challenge occurred at 24 and 48 hpb, the survival rate increased to 55% and 80%, respectively. By 72 hpb, mice were no longer susceptible to sublethal challenge (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). This suggests a rapid, short-lived impairment in the host immune response to the burn. We also infected burned mice via routes that were distinct from the burn (i.e., intravenous [i.v.], intraperitoneal [i.p.], and skin outside the burn borders [s.c., nonburn]) immediately following the burn. We observed a 2-log reduction in the LD<sub>50</sub> for i.v. and i.p. routes of infections as well as a 1-log reduction in the LD<sub>50</sub> for an s.c. infection of nonburned skin outside the burn wound relative to sham mice. There was also a noticeable difference in the time of onset of clinical symptoms and morbidity among all groups (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>

                <title>Serum HMGB1 levels increase postburn regardless of <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> infection.</title>
                <p>We next assessed the levels of serum HMGB1 in the context of burn injury and <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> M2 infection. In burned, noninfected mice, HMGB1 levels rose to over 50 ng/ml immediately following the burn but returned to a baseline of ∼20 ng/ml after 9 hpb (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). In contrast, in the presence of infection, serum HMGB1 levels peaked at 250 ng/ml (i.e., &gt;10-fold increase) after the burn with infection and remained elevated until death (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). In mice subjected to burn alone or burn with infection, increased HMGB1 concentrations preceded the elevation in serum cytokines. Due to the dramatic postburn increase in HMGB1, a TLR4 agonist (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), we employed an HEK-Blue mTLR4-driven NF-κB reporter cell assay to determine if the serum from burned mice at 0 hpb was biologically active and capable of stimulating the TLR4-mediated NF-κB stimulation. We observed that sera from burned mice increased stimulation of NF-κB activity in this assay, whereas negligible reporter activity was observed with sham mouse sera (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). We did not detect endotoxin in any of the sera by <italic toggle="yes">Limulus</italic> amoebocyte lysate (LAL) assay.</p>

                <p>To determine if the observed HMGB1 levels were linked to mortality, we treated mice with P5779, a small-molecule inhibitor of TLR4 stimulation via HMGB1.

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>The flame-based burn procedure employed here resulted in a nonlethal, full-thickness burn with the cellular destruction confined to the epidermis and dermis (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). These findings were comparable to the burn depths achieved, visualized by H&amp;E-stained slides of burned and sham skin by Leung et al. in their scald burn study in which they achieved partial and full-thickness scald burns (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Directly after the burn, mice were injected with 3.3 × 10<sup>4</sup> CFU of live <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> M2 (two logs lower than the s.c. LD<sub>50</sub> for sham mice) or equivalent amounts of HK <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> M2 or purified <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> M2 LPS s.c. at the burn site. Only mice that received an injection of viable <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> M2 showed clinical symptoms or had detectable <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> at the burn site or distal organs. Furthermore, all mice that were infected with viable <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> M2 became moribund within 26 hpb. However, mice that received HK bacteria, LPS (from the challenge <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content>), or PBS postburn showed no clinical symptoms or any signs of distress, suggesting that the burn itself is not fatal but rather replicating <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> M2 is required to cause disease (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Mice that received an infection with 1 × 10<sup>4</sup> CFU of live <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> M2 without a burn remained in good health and gained weight. <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> M2 could be isolated from the burn site directly after the infection and quickly increased in concentration. However, we did not detect <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> M2 in the blood or peripheral organs prior to the onset of clinical symptoms. Once <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> M2 was detectable in the blood and organs, the health of the mice rapidly deteriorated until they required euthanasia. <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> M2 may need to replicate to a sufficiently high concentration in the skin to disseminate (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Therefore, treatment to prevent <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> M2 sepsis should begin prior to the bacterial dissemination from the skin. This continued presence of bacteria at the burn site provides the rationale for clinical targeting of the burn eschar.</p>
              <p>Burned mice infected with <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> M2 showed increased circulating proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and IFN-γ) and a rise in anti-inflammatory IL-10 late during infection once clinical symptoms were observed. These data are reminiscent of the cytokine response to <named-content content-type="genus-species">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</named-content> sepsis following cecal ligation and puncture in mice (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Interestingly, it has been reported that a difference in the IL-10-to-TNF-α ratio was seen in patients with severe sepsis, with nonsurvivors having a ratio of &gt;4.5 48 h after admission (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The IL-10/TNF-α ratio in our study at 12 hpb with infection was 6.6 ± 2.4 and rose to 11.1 ± 3.7 at the onset of symptoms. Future work is needed to determine if this ratio can be used as a predictor of survivability of mice in the burn model.</p>
              <p>In contrast, the only cytokine detected in mice that received a burn without infection was IL-6, which peaked at 24 h and returned to baseline levels after 48 h. The half-life of IL-6 in mice is between 8 and 12 h, suggesting that the IL-6 response to the burn occurred rapidly but did not persist in the absence of a secondary insult, such as a superimposed bacterial infection (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Most interestingly, there was a difference in serum IL-6 levels between burned and sham mice that received an injection of HK <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> M2. At 3 hpb, sham mice produced &gt;200% more serum IL-6 on average than mice with burn injury. This suggests that viable tissue at the injection site is required for an initial robust IL-6 response (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), which has been observed in a mouse model of turpentine-induced tissue inflammation l (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Based on these cytokine data, we conclude that the flame burn produces an initial short-lived IL-6 response from the viable tissue adjacent to the burn site that is transient in the absence of an infection.</p>
              <p>We confirmed previous data showing reduction of LD<sub>50</sub> at distal sites that are outside the area of cellular destruction of the burn and the waning of the increased susceptibility to <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> M2 infection at the burn site after 72 h (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>) (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Together, along with the transient nature of IL-6 postburn, this suggests that there must be other soluble factors generated from the burned tissue that influence the general host defenses very soon after tissue destruction from the flame.</p>
              <p>High-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) is passively released from necrotic cells and increases in the circulation directly after burns in both humans and rats (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). HMGB1 is also actively released in low concentrations by responding innate immune cells, such as macrophages, early during bacterial infection. In the later stages of sepsis, hepatocytes and other somatic cells actively release HMGB1 in very high concentrations (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). It is likely that the massive immediate tissue destruction from the burn passively releases HMGB1 into the circulation, which caused activation of NF-κB through the TLR4-MD-2 signaling pathway. We screened serum HMGB1 levels postburn, without and with infection. After a burn without infection, serum HMGB1 levels rose significantly to 50 ng/ml within minutes of the burn and returned to baseline levels within 9 h. In contrast, burned mice that received a lethal s.c. infection with <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> M2 exhibited serum HMGB1 levels that increased immediately after the burn and continued to increase to a concentration of &gt;250 ng/ml at the time of morbidity. We saw an increase in TLR4-mediated NF-κB stimulation <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> with serum from burned, noninfected mice compared to sham mice, suggesting that some factor(s) in the sera can biologically activate NF-κB through the TLR4 pathway after the burn and may be responsible, in part, for the observed cytokine cascade. Samples were screened for endotoxin by LAL assay. No endotoxin was detected in the serum that was used to stimulate the NF-κB reporter cell line; however, serum that was drawn at 18 hpb with infection contained approximately 0.24 ng/ml endotoxin. Disulfide-containing HMGB1 signals through the TLR4/MD2 pathway cause inflammation via NF-κB activation (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). There are three HMGB1 redox isoforms (all-thio, disulfide, and oxidized), each with its own function (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Only the disulfide-linked isoform is an active TLR4 agonist (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Future studies should determine the isoform proportions and if the HMGB1 is passively or actively released after the burn with infection with <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> M2 (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>).</p>
              <p>P5779 is a small-molecule antagonist of HMGB1 that acts by inhibiting the association between HMGB1 and MD 2, which prevents HMGB1-mediated TLR4 signaling (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). P5779 has been used to reduce mortality in mice in other inflammatory-related diseases, such as influenza (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). To assess if circulating HMGB1 postburn affects mortality, burned and infected mice were treated i.p. with P5779 (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). Treatment of burned and infected mice with P5779 significantly prolonged survival, with 3 of 24 (12.5%) surviving the length of the experiment, to 7 days (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). At 72 hpb, the remaining three P5779-treated mice showed no signs of disease. The bacterial burden in the surviving mice was high in the eschar despite the lack of clinical symptoms. No bacteria were detected in the blood or spleen of the surviving mice. The survival of these mice and their lack of clinical symptoms after 72 h are concurrent with the return of normal host defenses at 72 hpb. The increase in survival in the P5779-treated group shows that circulating HMGB1 contributes significantly to the inflammation generated from the burn plus infection and suggests that HMGB1 should be studied further as a potential therapeutic target. Although we saw some survival and an increased mean time to death, other factors may be involved in <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> M2-related mortality postburn. HMGB1 is only one of many DAMPs: heat shock proteins, HSP100, mitochondrial DNA, extracellular DNA and RNA, and others are released after tissue trauma and signal through multiple pattern recognition receptors (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). It is possible that other DAMPs contribute to morbidity and mortality in this flame-based mouse burn infection model and should be addressed in future studies.</p>
              <p>Most laboratory-based burn research studies use scalding water baths or heated brass rods to achieve a burn (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). These models mimic the effects from scalds and touching hot surfaces but may not be optimal for understanding the effects of a flame burn, as heat may transfer into the animal differently and result in different secondary and tertiary effects. There are relatively few studies of flame burn models in mice. Burn size and final subdermal temperatures may dictate the inflammatory response and susceptibility or even mortality from the burn alone. Our 10% TBSA flame burn resulted in a nonlethal burn that increased susceptibility to <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> M2 infections. The rate at which our mice became moribund from infection with <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> is comparable to <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> infections in mice that received a nonlethal 6% to 8% TBSA full-thickness scald burn (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). The lethality of the burn without infection is most likely due to the total size of the burn. Larger (18%) surface area burns in mice were shown to have mortality rates of 22% for scald burns and 11% for flame burns in the absence of infection (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Our flame-resistant template produced a highly reproducible 10% TBSA burn when using Meeh’s constant of 9.74 for CD1 mice to calculate burn area (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Our immune responses differ from results found in C57BL/6 mice that received a 35% TBSA scald burn (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). These studies found increased IL-1β and TNF-α postburn in the absence of infection within the first 24 h. This could be due to the larger percentage of the burn size or possibly from the heat transfer of the scalding water. The initial subdermal temperature of a 90°C scald burn and an ethanol-based flame burn are similar. However, after 9 s, the subdermal temperature from a scald burn can be 19°C higher than a flame burn in mice (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>).</p>
              <p>Taken together, these data suggest that a nonlethal 10% TBSA flame burn increased the susceptibility of mice to mortality from s.c. <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. aeruginosa</named-content> M2 infection even though there was only local destruction of the epidermis and dermis. Unlike burn models that are lethal in the absence of infection, this nonlethal burn model allowed us to examine the independent effects of the burn on the host response and identify a critical role for HMGB1 in burn wound sepsis. Since blockade of HMGB1 signaling postburn increased survival in mice, a similar blockade of HMGB1 signaling in burn patients may allow additional time for further interventions.</p>

The burn induced by pressing a flame-resistant polymer card with a 2.5-cm by 4.0-cm cutout (representing ∼10% of total body surface area) on the clipped back, followed by the application of 0.5 ml of 200-proof ethanol spread uniformly into the cutout, ignited with a flame, and allowed to burn for precisely 10 s. Mice were infected directly after the burn by subcutaneous injection at the burn site with 100 μl of bacterial suspension (∼10<sup>4</sup> CFU; a sublethal dose in sham-treated mice but a 3-log LD<sub>50</sub> for burned mice) or PBS. Mice were administered 500 μl Ringer's solution given intraperitoneally. Mice were allowed to recover on an HTP-1500 veterinarian-grade heating blanket (Adroit Medical Systems, Loudon, TN). A 3-log LD<sub>50</sub> challenge dose initiated onset of clinical symptoms at ∼18 hpb. Sham mice had their hair clipped and received the same amount of anesthesia as the experimental groups but neither burn nor infection. Mice were observed twice a day postburn for clinical signs of sepsis and distress. A score between 1 and 3 was given to each mouse, 3 being normal appearance with no signs of distress and 1 requiring euthanasia, based on a previously described scoring system (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>).</p>

                <p>Following terminal anesthesia, cardiac puncture was performed to obtain blood. The skin was then dissected from the burn site as follows. The surgical area was cleaned with 70% ethanol. Tissue was removed with a scalpel and surgical scissors in a 1-cm-by-1-cm square that extended from the surface of the epidermis through the skeletal muscle. Samples were placed in cassettes and allowed to fix for 72 h in 10% formaldehyde prior to being sectioned and stained with H&amp;E. Slides were examined by a blinded dermatologic pathologist and imaged at ×10, ×40, and ×60 magnification using a BZX all-in-one microscope system (Keyence, Itasca, IL).</p>
